    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Happy Friday.  Like to point out two important things first. You probably just got an email that said homework was released.  This allows you to go into grade scope and you can see exactly why you got things marked off by the the were the ones that great this and through the gradescope system. You can request a re-grade if you believe something was graded incorrectly. I strongly suggest  Did you look over things carefully? The Tas must grade 270 papers * 6 problems. Each problem probably requires them to make 10 decisions.  That is a lot of decisions to get correct and they make mistakes everyone makes mistakes. So take your grade into your own hands and be responsible for it. You will have 72 hours to do the three days.  And the same will be true of exams. So get in the process now of getting on things as soon as they're released and fighting and advocating for yourself. The next thing is here. We are Friday is a week from today. If you going to try and add you can find a folder now called exam 1 materials.  There's a document here that will tell you what topics are covered what things are not and all the other information students always ask about and every time I get a question that doesn't appear on this I added to the sheet and it is now stabilized. So I basically get no questions. So everything you want to know is here for example  Furthermore you'll see that I liked a post old exams.  Here you'll get for old exams with Solutions.  You should use these carefully though. The wrong thing to do is to just work through those and assume that that is adequate preparation.  You should do all of your studying be ready for battle then open up the first one and see how you actually do and taken under time circumstances with the materials you have available to you during the actual exam.  That will give you a sense of how prepared you were for battle. Then you move on to the next one after refreshing all the areas you were weak on and so on.  Okay, do not expect them to look exactly like these it's rare for me to ask a question that looks like one from the old exam because it in and it just shows who looked at the old exams. I want someone who's truly ready for battle. Whatever that means. Okay, we move on.  Today's a fun day.  Your first introduction to random variables your whole life variables have not been random.  They've been normal variables standard variables and some cents will start with his little problem here.  I thought about this when I was actually sitting at the DMV being miserable.  And I was like, this is exactly what's happening right now. So you're at the DMV to tell her you're about to go to is either happy or frustrated. That was the only two moods they could possibly be in if they're in a good mood which is only 10% of the time you get served very quickly if they're in a bad mood. Sorry for you. It's going to be eight minutes for that same transaction because they will draw it out to spite you or the world or whomever. How long do you expect the trans action to take someone tell me how your soul feels  Go ahead.  Stop what does close to 8 minutes mean?  A little bit less than hate why a little bit less than eight.  Okay, you said the rare event is a good mood which equals short time the common event equals bad mood which equals long time so you're telling me something near 8, but not equal to does it bother you that you're giving me an answer.  It can't be my experience. My experience can either be 2 minutes or 8 minutes, but you're telling me a number that is not a possible thing. I will experience. Does that bother you?  It doesn't feel good.  Okay. Well, let's go see first of all, hopefully you realize.  That you don't just want an average the two so I'm glad you didn't do that. Okay, if it is like the worst thing you could say. Yes the numbers 2 and 8 appear but you don't have urge them cuz they're not equally likely maybe if I never realized this before but an average weight everything equally when you add them all up and divided by the denominator, in fact, if there end things everything's weighted one of our end.  But here we don't want to do that because you said the probabilities are different. So what you were doing in your soul, perhaps was the following calculation you were saying sometimes we'll get two minutes, but that's only 10% of the time and sometimes we'll get 8 minutes and that's 90% of the time and when you combine those effects together we get 7.4 which is near 8 but not 8  Okay. So this way you could do this calculation if you wanted to put numbers on it, but I like where your soul goes and your soul was doing this calculus internally, which is kind of cool.  Now this is a question of you can't actually experience this. Well if you're asking someone.  On what they expect to happen. This could be an average idea. That's what that word could mean it could also mean what's going to be the most likely thing that's going to happen to you and then the answer is eight which is an easy question to answer. So we're going to use the word expect here to mean this idea. So let's set this up in general first thing. There's some sort of random event that's happening here. And that's the tellers mood which is influenced by Infinity things, which is so complicated. We just call it random and here there were two outcomes, but you can imagine that they were in possible outcomes and it's important these all be numbers here was measuring how long you would have to wait as you were being served.  Now it's possible that not all these outcomes are equally likely most most of our life so far has been equally likely things like rolling a die. All the sides were equally likely and the outcomes were 1 through 6, so they might have different probabilities. So if you hide what might happen behind a letter of the alphabet called X, you've created a random variable.  So here's a way to think about this object. There is this box here. It has an X written on the side of it and has a button and you push and when you push the button it spits out a number and that number that it spits out is one of these n possibilities. Can I push it again? You might get a different number push it again. You might get a different number and you just keep pushing it and inside the box of some complicated calculus where decides when it's going to give you based on How likely the possible outcomes are they all have their hidden probability that you don't see and it makes the decision somehow randomly. Maybe it spins a spinner inside.  So before all of your variables have been non-random if I give you an equation like x + 3 equals 4.  That's cannoli be one thing right? The number one. There's a random this to it can't change. But now we're creating an object that can change what comes out of it or what it's representing or what is hiding.  Okay, so this note is a random variable and there's different kinds. So first of all, you should think about a random variable is just some letter of the alphabet usually uppercase it can take on a numeric values. That's an important word.  And weights decided what value it takes on is based on something random.  Two major categories that will study in life. The first is called a discrete random variable.  So this is when if you hit the button on the machine, you can only get a finite list of possibilities like an AR DMV example, you could only get the numbers 2 or 8. That's a finite list.  People also use the word when there's an infinite number of possibilities.  But there's space between them.  So for example, here's a box. There's a button on it. I'm going to hit it and it's going to tell you how many children you will have.  Think about the outcomes first 0 1 2 3 4 Etc.  Would you rather space between us you're not going to get one and a half children when I hit this button?  I guess that's also just be a random variable and it goes back to the discrete data types that we're starting earlier there space between them. Okay, why is the number of meteors that hit some random Planet? It's 01 to etcetera. The other kind is called a continuous random variable which have a smooth range of possibilities. We do later just more complicated. So we need a probability model in. This is a visualization that helps us understand completely this box that I'm trying to create it has this button on it.  So we'll make one of these and you can see that it just sort of describes everything going on.  So let's go back to the DMV.  Siamese capital x people tend to choose letters like X Y and Z cuz they feel like variables they tend to capitalize them. So they look different in math class and feels like a random variable. So this is a very smart convention to use here. So here's our probability model. You need to list in one column all the possible things that could come out of the box or all the things you could experience which are the numbers 2 and 8 because ex is representing the numerical processing time of the DMV. How long you have to wait the next column you want to put is How likely those things are now, I just put it all in words when we started right? But here's the knights condensation of it that has all the important ideas.  You can come over here and make a picture know what happens is on the horizontal axis.  This is where the possible values show up.  So I listen to I was at 8. So the only ones right and the vertical axis becomes the probability that those are occurring. So it allows you to see that 8 is much more likely to occur then to it is very important that you remember the numbers are along the horizontal axis. Those are the values of the random variable can take on another way to think about this machine. I'm going to throw a dart at this visualization suppose it must land in the blue. Okay. So when I throw the dart and land somewhere in the blue if it landed over here in the dark sort of dropped down to the number to and that's what comes out of machine or that you experience of the DMV. So there's more area than it's a more likely thing to occur. But I always drops down and gives you the horizontal axis value is what you experienced.  Now the question I was asking you about what do you expect to occur? This is called the expectation of the random variable. And this is one of the most important things you ever do to a random variable you say hey, I know you can give me values.  I 2 and 8, but I want to know what's going to happen sort of on average.  So before we were doing this calculation buy a weighted average, what what things are possible and How likely are they if both of these were 1/2 or 50% then it becomes a normal average so you can see why it's doing a weighted average and waiting some things more now the exit number and that number is also somewhere along the horizontal axis. And if I draw 7.4 in there may be a few words to you like the balancing point where the fulcrum should go and some Physics class if there's a kid over here who weighs that much and a kid over here and you put the Seesaw fulcrum, so they balance  So that's what the expected value is doing actually and it should feel like the mean of a histogram in the same sentence.  Okay, so in general if you have any random variable and you wanted to find its expectation.  Use the following formula. Okay. So first we're going to do a summation and estimation is over a little X. So people use Little X to denote a possible value that could come out of big axe. It should feel like a number like 2 or 8.  And you're going to go through all the possible values you could get out and you're going to take me to value and you go to x How likely it is its probability of occurring. It's a good summation. You can just look above and see where it came from take each value x and x its probability of occurring atom all together and you've created a weighted average.  So there's a definition this summation. Sometimes have a finite number of things in it.  For example to 1/8 DMV board might have an infinite number of things how many children will a random person have in their life?  It's okay. You can add up infinitely many things and get a finite number.  You can also add up things and possibly get infinity. So the expectation of infinity is a possibility. Oh my goodness.  So, let's see how you do not for me talking so I'll give you some situation.  And our goal is to build a probability model so you can drop me a beautiful table.  So here it is. We're going to roll a standard six-sided die. If you can even number you were going to hand your friend $4.  It's however you roll an odd number.  Then we roll the die again.  If your second roll matches your first your friend will give you $72.  If your second and first roles do not match you will pay your friend $12.  So I'm being kind here by setting up the random variable in words begin. This is one of those important things you can do to get better in life. Let X be the amount of money that exchanges hands.  make a probability model for x  Good luck. I should take one minute and 30 seconds if you're on fire.  If you think you're done look at your call and called out, which has all the numbers in it and ask yourself if they should all be positive.  Okay. There we go.  The outcome column should be an outcome of the random variable something the random variable could produce here the random variable if you just look at it is about Mount amount of money. So you should have numbers in these columns.  And it should not all be positive because sometimes the money is Flowing from you to your friend and sometimes it's flowing in the reverse Direction. So you can use the sign to keep track of that doesn't matter if you flipped all my signs here. You're just thinking about it from your friends perspective or your perspective.  Okay, you probably want to think about it from yours.  Some egocentrism nonsense, whatever okay events feel like words and descriptions of things happening. Now. Most people could probably get three out of six for even  Audra Lowe my goodness. Well first you need to make the odd will occur.  That's the one half event and then after that if your goals to match  You need to make sure that when you roll it again, you get what you got the first time so it's the one out of six events. If you will the three the first time when it comes time for the second ID to be flying through the air, there's a one out of six chance it'll land on that three.  Okay, you don't know II dies going to be on for example, it could be even or odd. So that's why the denominator still 6 in this should be 1/2 x 5 6.  If you doubt whether this is correct or not, you could add up the numbers in this column. They must add to 1 something has to happen. Go ahead.  Okay, I will come is a word all use in this setting to mean a possible value that the random variable can take on.  Hear the random variable is about money exchanging hands. And if you look up here, the only things with dollar signs on them or the 412 and 72.  Sofia okay it slightly different the word outcome being used when we had sample spaces.  How come it's like a possible thing. Go ahead.  Okay. So the question is what if you change it, so every time you roll an odd the game must read begin if I re begin you mean that if I roll an even now, then we're here in the even setting.  Is that what you mean by that or do you see if if we start again in these can never happen the bottom to is that what you want?  Okay. So what you're asking about create sort of a fractal tree diagram what splits even-odd?  And then odd Begins the free all over again so you don't have the tools yet to do this.  But you have to use some sort of symmetry within the tree fractal diagram in order to solve things, but it's doable.  So 180b is one course where you learn how to deal with things like that if you want to know, okay. Anyhow, there's our beautiful little diagram. It's time for you to keep going. Should we play this game?  I'll let you think about this.  Raise your hand and tell me if you want to play this game or not. Why?  Dupont Road, we good.  You said no the expected value is -1 Seer expected to lose money. So did you go to this calculation? Let's take each possible outcome that occur financially in X How likely it is. So we're going to lose $4 half the time we're going to gain 72 one out of 12 times on average and we're going to lose $12 5 out of 12 times and that happens to equal -1  Don't want to play a game then on average are going to be losing money.  Very nice. That was good. You shouldn't play anything with the expected value is negative.  Now way back in the beginning of class. I asked what we expected on average from the DMV and you said something near age, but not it you were thinking 7.4 in your head. And I said does it bother you that the expectation is not one of the possible outcomes?  So here again, we see that the expectation is not one of the possible outcomes. In fact, that's almost always true.  And you shouldn't need it to be one.  Dissertation is what happens on average?  And there's plenty of things that the average is never attainable. Like if you assign the gender female is one and the gender male is 0  on average you're going to get the value point five or .51, assuming gender binaries and people are willing to accept some binary designation. I'm going to try hard to get that in society. So the excitation is telling you something more you already know all the possible outcomes. So it helps to have a tool that tells you on average what's going to occur and doesn't necessarily have to be one of them that provides value.  You can also think about the expectation this way. What are you just play the game a Time?  Internet infinitely many times is the ideal. But just how about ten thousand times every time you play you will get one of the possible outcomes until your big list will look like this right if you average the huge list together.  in a normal average way  admelog / Harbor mini are there you will get something around -1 now. You don't need to do a weighted average on this list because it's already waited things that are more likely to occur show up more in the list. Then things that are less likely that's why you can use a normal average on a list a huge list of things that occurred in life.  So there's another way to think about expectation. And again, it doesn't have to be one of the outcomes. So, this is our first Greek letter.  If you don't like any of X or Eve capital x as it were then you can ride mew. I'm fine with that.  So this is called a parameter. This is a word we're going to use a lot in this class. It's just some value that helps summarize some complicated situation. That's all the parameter is.  another other kinds of parameters  and you might care about for example how spread out are the values that could occur from some random variable.  So if you play a game where a flip of a coin heads gives you a dollar and a tail you lose a dollar the expectation is 0  if you play a game where heads gives you a million dollars and Tails, you lose a million dollars.  The expectation is still zero. So something is different about those games. You felt it in your soul when I said a million dollars, right?  Much more spread out. So we need a way to do that. And we need a letter of the alphabet that will help us there.  So spread is the next thing and just like it was for histograms. It's a measure of how spread out.  Things are or you can also think about it is how far things are from the average experience. That's how I like to think about it. So we're going to start by defining something called the variance.  This will feel related to the standard deviation cuz it is so here's the definition of variance. It's given the letter Sigma squared which suggests maybe one day. We'll be taking the square root of this thing and it be cool if we could just take the square root in there be a nice letter for it Sigma.  And use the definition so the sum over all possible values or outcomes of the random variable. You're going to take each one and you can subtract it and figure out how far it is from the average. So this me right here is the expected value. So to find the variance you have to start with the expectation.  Have you done that differential Square it and then your X How likely it even was to get that value of x if it's a really unlikely thing then don't get excited about it.  This is the problem when you play the lottery, right? Yeah, you can win a hundred million dollars in the Mega Millions, but are you really multiplying by the probability of it occurring in your soul?  I don't know any how  so let's look an example see what this feels like to calculate one of these. So here is our weird wacky game.  And I'll start going through this calculation. You'll see it sort of a frustrating big mess. So I took our first possible value -4x subtracted the expectation which was itself negative and I swear it so it makes a positive idea.  Otherwise some things deviate in a positive way from the mean and something's deviate in a negative way. And if you just start adding it all together and also have cancels out. So squaring is a nice way to make things positive.  Okay. Now this -4 is a pretty common event for us. It happens half the time. So you want to include quite strongly in the calculation of spread where the other things like getting a 72 which is super exciting happens when out of 12 times.  So it's very far away from the average experience.  But it's very rare. So again, it's doing a weighted-average. So there's a big hot mess. Skip all the internal steps we get to number 499  Now this is very frustrating this cookie. We've just done first of all tamesi calculation second of all the units on it are not just normal little units you have to look at what happened in the calculation. So this is really negative. $4 minus negative $1.  Pacemakers negative $3 which quits Square to the units get squared right there. That's why it's dollars squared.  So it's frustrating in the sense that the units don't help you make sense. They're difficult to interpret what that means. I don't know the square doll or is never seen one.  But what's nice about this?  Is that a lot of the most powerful interesting valuable facts and statistics use the variance because it's a nice object.  We could take the square root of this and we're going to get the standard deviation. The units will dusk be nice.  But the calculation is a little Messier in the cool formulas and Stat don't use the standard deviation. Unfortunately, so you're the definition of standard deviation for a random variable, you know, the definition of standard deviation for a set of data sitting in front of you homework to drill that into your soul, right?  Hey, so this is for a random variable.  I dislike the square root of the variance. Love it.  Okay, so obviously that'll have the notation Sigma. So in our game if you take the square root now dollars squared goes to dollars.  And so what this says is an average we're going to lose a dollar every time we play it now we can never actually do that, but that's okay.  And in terms of what we emotional experience as we're losing our dollar every time.  You can go up a standard deviation down a standard deviation. Those are pretty typical emotional experiences. You're going to have in fact, some people say go out to standard deviations. And those are typical experiences you're going to have  So this game has a pretty big spread 22, you can see if you go up a standard deviation. There's positive things in that zone. You've got all the way up to 21.34.  So you want games if you're designing the ultimate casino that have a negative expectations who suck money out of humanity.  But you want to make sure that the spread is big enough so that the experience of people dips into the positives. So they get that dopamine release when they win a little even though you're bleeding them dry.  Okay. Oh and if you want to make it even crazier have a big standard deviation.  Then the dopamines even more powerful and the addiction is stronger. So the SD will give us a sense of how closely the emotional experience while you do the thing hugs. The mean small standard deviations are very boring. You're always getting me. You're always losing a dollar or dollar 01 or negative. You know, it's only 9  not a very fun game to play so you can think about yourself as a human being right now and you can say do I need high standard deviation experiences in life.  Or do I not like high standard deviation experiences when you go to a restaurant, do you order the same thing always?  Okay, your expectation is that quality an enjoyment out of that dish? If you always order the same thing you want a small standard deviation so that  you don't go to restaurant that have a bad experience. You're also missing out on the awesome experience that you could have but whatever.  Your friend feels bad about the nasty game cuz you always lose money. She offers to pay you $3.  Anytime you walk up to play it begins by Sheehan's you $3, then the you play the game.  What is the expected value of this game?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry how to get to  why is -1 + 3 equal to 2?  Assist regression the definition of the symbol 3 is the successor of two in the mathematical notation.  Play one plus one equals two because two is too fine to be the symbol. That is the successor of one good.  You got to now, here's the hard thing for people. They don't know how to write an expression that models what's going on now? And here's how you do it three plus act. So it's okay to use random variables and expressions. So the story is hey, you just got three dollars and the access point to spit out a number like  72 or -4 or 12 or something like that. So that's how you would model something like that. So in your soul you just did something.  I don't know if you realize you did it.  I asked you to find the expectation of a random variable plus a constant and you just said I will just take the expectation of the random variable.  And I'll just add it to the constant you did that, didn't you?  Is that true? Well, it turns out it is true. That's one of the properties of expectation. You can go prove usually in a 188 class.  Yes, sir. Three plus X is a random variable it basically just the random variable x with some shifting going on to it, but it's a random variable expression or random variable.  You've heard random variables are neither random nor. Okay, so I disagree with that claim. They are random in the sense that there's a random process that underpins them and gives rise to the value that's coming out know whether it's a variable or not is a definitional thing that people arguing over definition for setting is a waste of time in life. Okay. So if you think a variable is an idea you saw math that must take on a specific value.  Okay, then this doesn't feel like that cuz you can take on different values. But when you study math education research you realize that there are actually seven or eight different kinds of variables. I'll give you an example.  2x plus 1 equals 5  There's a letter they're called acts. Right but we all know x equals 2 can't be anything else.  y equals 2x + 1  There's a thing they're called X.  But in your soul you're thinking about ex differently.  Texas supposed to Range Rover all possibilities in the real number system and if it does why respond accordingly and you get a line of slope 2 with intercept one. So right there you see the letter X used in the same expression 2x + 1 but it acts differently.  So anyhow, the right ways to say what are all the different ways human beings use the word variable and understand the differences between them and their seven or eight such ones. So that's how I feel. Okay, great question. That was interesting wondering who sang all this nonsense out there in the universe.  So here's our Rolex plus or minus a constancy. When you try to take the expectation. Apparently you can just take the expectation of x.  And just add or subtract the constant after another way thinking about it if you can move the added or subtracted constant outside the expectation.  You've seen this property before for example limits have this take the limit of some weird thing plus a constant. You just take the limit of the weird thing and then later at the constant. Okay, so this  It's something I should feel familiar. Okay. Now we're going to play this game, right because suddenly dictation is positive if expectation is 0 it's your decision in life whether you want to play the game or not. Okay, maybe she's fun to play it even though you'll break even  But the rational actor only plays the game when they make money because wasting time is not good.  So what are the variance and standard deviation of the new version? We always get $3 at it before you start.  Go ahead.  So you said you think the variance and standard deviation of the same because when we had three all it does is just shift the possible values over by 3, but they're equally spread out as they were before.  Was that true of then standard deviation of a set of data?  It was true. They're also absolutely so variance and standard deviation are measures of spread. But we're just doing a horizontal shift. So here's a picture the original game and blue. You're not going to be sick bars. I'll just draw a little line segments going up and there's the shift that you were talking about seen and read the red stuff is just a spread out from itself as the blue stuff is spread out from itself as a visualization will convince you that you can do an algebraic argument in 180 as where you'll do it, but I don't think it's very rewarding. It's not very intuition e and I think the intuition around ideas is far more important.  In many cases than rigorous theoretical proofs. So if we now try to take what you just said and put it into equations, it says the variance of a random variable plus or minus a constant. It's just the variance of the random variable ignoring this shift you are attempting to do and they sent you can just erase added or subtracted Constance that appear in variance formula or in standard deviation formulas that slick that's a nice way to simplify things.  Now these are all constants being added or subtracted you can guess what's about to happen?  In fact, you're so should be screaming. This is what we need to do next. We need to be multiplying.  or dividing by consonants  Okay, so let's try this your friend and I losing money, right cuz you're winning money. So she's going to stop paying $3. So we're back to the original game. And then she says something different and see what happens. Okay, so whatever outcome you normally would have gotten your friend is not going to double it.  So paying her for it becomes paying her 8 and she entices You by saying when you you don't win 72 anymore you win $144 imagine that crisp Underwood coming into your hair does twenties and then an overflowing ream of one's adding up to 144 think how sexy it would be to win that I'm instantly will change your life.  What are music miswired in Sigma now?  O getting tougher.  Intuition can be a funny thing.  Cuz you can be wrong when things get hard. And this is where intuition starts to fall apart. So first thing you want to do is write an expression that represents what's going on.  So 2x is what we want to use here because you just hitting the button on the game. It's spitting out a number like 72 and then that just gets doubled.  Okay, nothing but the game has changed the black box is to the same internally. That's how I know to use 2X.  Okay, so these are the Expressions we want he and Bar in SD of 2x.  This is where it starts to get non intuition e, so most people might say, oh well definition of ax. It's probably just a x the expectation of x.  If I was going to lose $1 before and now everything is place the steaks.  I'm probably going to lose 2 * $1.  That probably feels good to you where it gets messy. It's here in the bar. So you can show that the VAR of a x a random variable is a squared.  * the variance  now for some people this is natural and has intuition you notice back when we found the variance the units were all squared ideas.  Dolar squared right, so maybe it seems reasonable that constant need to have some squaring action applied to them also.  You shaking your head? Yes, you like this? Okay, good. Now you won't forget it. The standard deviation gets a little dirtier standard deviation is just normal units. So can't we just pull out the a will there's a problem.  Hey could be a negative idea.  For example, you could double all outcomes and then switch the direction that money is Flowing that would be like * -2. So if you hear it's possible that the right hand side could be negative. And last time I checked the measure of how spread out something is is not a negative.  Idea, that's why the absolute value bars. Are there maybe that intuition feels good after I tell it to you. Okay, and somewhere in the horrible algebra, that should happen. The other way to see it. All I have to do is take the square root of this equation and it brings you down to the one below. Right and the square root of a square is  The absolute value now, it's not hard to remember it all got it. Okay, so it's just all the numbers here. So you can see the expectation really is -2  the variance interesting Lee is now four times the original variants 2 squared.  And the standard deviation which does yield intuition is just double the old standard deviation.  Okay, I guess that seems believable.  Now for the hardest one.  Oh my goodness, you decide to play the original game.  Each weekday and record your weekly earnings.  That's not what you're obsessed with.  What value should you expect for the weekly earnings and how much variation is there in the weekly totals?  I don't care about the individual game totals anymore.  The first thing you have to do is decide what random variable expression is going to represent what's going on.  Now this is what the problem wants. So they're weekdays. Are there only five of them the first excuse ehere is Monday's totals.  That could combine with Tuesday's totals Etc.  Now if you write it like this, you're tempted to act like this kind of variable behaves like the math.  random the math variable in mathematics you would write this as  5X  but here you don't write it as 5X.  And it turns out because the expression x + x + x + x + x just isn't the same as 5x when things are random variables, which will see in a moment. Okay. So in order to avoid this temptation  I suggest you use this kind of notation X1 + X2 all the way through X5. Now the subscripts make them feel uncomfortable.  And it turns out they are not combinable despite all of your intuition screaming the other way.  You could also use mtwrf as subscripts for Monday through Friday if you wanted to be even more helpful to human beings.  Now if I write like this and you can't stop them all together into an expression like 5x, then you have to know how to take the expectation of two random variables added together.  Okay, like x + y that will be X1 + X2 for us eventually.  So this is the final set of equations that we have to talk about.  So it turns out the expectation of the sum of two things is just the sum of the expectations.  And if there happened to be a minus between them, then it's just a difference of the expectations. That's what this plus or minus means. You take the top symbol map to the top symbol and the bottom one in Napa to the bottom.  Okay, next the variance of two things added or subtracted turns out to be just the sum of the variances.  So there is no plus or minus symbol over on the right hand side.  Just a plus.  The reason there's no minus symbol if there were minus between the things on the right hand side. It could potentially be negative.  Variances can't be negative. That's how I know intuitively. There has to be a plus there. No sound obvious that there should be that that should be the formula, but you can see right now why I like variances so much in the variance formula is  the bearings of a song that the sum of the variances looks nice, right? This is why we Define variance cuz it's beautiful properties Lookout horrible the standard deviation formula is  Standard deviation of the song or difference of two random variables is the square root of the sum of the variances in the random variables. Oh my goodness.  This is a mess.  Now what are all these other words if X and Y are independent random variables?  Toyota Tundra independent random variables yet imagined two boxes one called The X one called why each of a button?  These boxes are independent from each other if hitting the results hitting the box and getting results on the first one.  Doesn't influence what's going to happen over on the second box? Okay, so there's no like the internal workings. Right? Do you want to make sure there's no wire between the two boxes and information?  It's as if the first box spits out at 7, then the seven bought the second box will spit out something related to 7. Maybe you just need the outputs that come out of these things to be unrelated.  Okay, so that's what Independence means. You also noticed the fact on the very top of that expectations has no mention of Independence. So this is true of any kinds of random variables that can be independent or dependent. You can always just take the expectation easily and sum it up. And finally we talked about the VAR only having a plus over on the right hand side. Okay. So if we go to our game here  And we going to play five times. The cool thing is what happens on Monday does not influence what happens on Tuesday? Because the game is based on dice rolls and dice don't have memory.  Anyhow, so you can split the expectation into lots of individual ones and you get negative 5 as you might expect.  And when it comes time to do the variances, since they're all independent, you can just add up a bunch of 499.  That'll give you an answer and when it comes time for the standard deviation, you can just take the square root of the variance. So that's the easiest way to get the standard deviation of anything work with the variances first.  And then put a square root that you'll notice if you use the 5x formulation, which we said was wrong.  Sometimes the answer overlaps.  But sometimes it don't.  But you can just see through this example and if you want to understand why this occurs you can look at some of the remaining sides, but we got to stop so you can have your weekend.  enjoy  Can you see San Diego podcast?
