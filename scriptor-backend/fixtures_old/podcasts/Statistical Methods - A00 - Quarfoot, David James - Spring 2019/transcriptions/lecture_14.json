    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  I want to start by refreshing what we did yesterday because we did a lot conceptually, so we started with the idea of populations that is huge amount of people and something you want to study about the new maybe the average weight the average IQ. Okay, unfortunately too big to sample everybody. So you draw small little sample it in that sample. You can figure out what the averages and how spread out it is. Those might be useful things helping to understand what's going on up in the cloud with the population.  Okay, then we realized and unfortunately if you do a different sample, you might get a different result for X bar.  Oh, oh, so now you can think about X bar is a random variable different data sets have different averages. So the average will move around. Hopefully it's desperately trying to give you the Valium you if that's the True Value.  So then we started thinking about the sampling distribution, which was just a picture that showed you how xbar could bury. In fact it's nothing more than the density function of X bar. That's how I think about it.  So if we can understand that object that density function we can get a picture of what's going on with X bar. So we discovered that it was normal.  And the clump of mass of the probability is around Mew that is its trying to give you the right answer but there's some variation and that was Sigma over the square root of an okay, and I did tell you that final result, although on the homework. You started to see how one might arrive it on that problem. We pulled for random numbers and did a bunch of things.  Okay, and then we said let's try to come up with this thing called a confidence interval. It will take rxbars her pad it and then we'll report that answer back up to the clouds.  Now I showed you a clunky visualization yesterday said Monday. I wanted to show you something Slicker cuz I know you like shiny things.  Your whole life you seem beautiful shiny things. So let's give you some more shiny things.  So this is a cycled seeing Theory this is created by students at Brown University and has all sorts of beautiful slick things using D3.  Okay, you can come up here and you can see all the different chapters that are in their book and who did this for example?  So we just need to find something that's going to be helpful for us here. Maybe interval estimation would be nice.  So what you do first as you select some distribution.  Hey, this is the population. It's what we had a blue curve on the other day. And then you decide how big you want a sample to be that you can see in you is right here this line. I would definitely like to know that value you can imagine that it's invisible. If you want to play this game here, you can set the confidence level.  So let's at 95% and then you can start generating samples. So it takes 21 people from the population.  Maybe it's measuring their weights and then an average ISM creates this little green. Right here and then it pads it and makes an interval around it in the whole key thing is how big do padded.  Now if you had it a ton.  Then it makes really wide intervals and you have a very good chance of capturing the true thing. That is Mew. Look how many of these are green colored. This is really good. We finally got a naughty one right there and read it came up at just the right time. You can hover your mouse over here and you can see what percentage of the intervals are capturing you right now. It's 97% Okay, but it can change. So the way the confidence interval structure is built is we have a confidence procedure.  The procedure is the following take your 21 people averaging to get a. And then patted the procedure spits out intervals, but the intervals are random they keep moving around, right?  So the procedure is designed so that a certain percentage of them 95% will capture the True Value, but there's some Clunkers in there and red.  He seemed so transfixed.  Isn't it amazing?  Just learn a little D3 and you can do simulations like this.  Okay don't want your intervals to do as good of a job.  They don't have them by very much when you can't even see the padding. It's so small.  Oh my goodness.  Look at that don't reach your arms out really wide. And guess what you missing you a lot of the time and you can see in real-time. So if you did this infinitely many times and made infinitely many intervals.  Then the confidence level here, which is 52% tells you what percent are green and capture Mew versus red.  Okay, now the only thing we haven't really done yet is figure out how to change the confidence level. Goodbye a confidence intervals. See you later.  So we're going to focus on that next but to finish up what we're doing here.  the way we thought about this confidence level is we thought about all those green dots falling down forming the sampling distribution, and we noticed that most of them  Are pretty close to Mew in fact, if you go out two standard deviations each way to get 95% of the dots or we thought about it the other way if you started every. And reach their arms out to standard deviations.  Then most of those would capture Mew.  Okay, so then we had this language 95% confident to discuss what percentage of the intervals if we made infinitely many would have new in them.  So now what we need to do is figure out how to change this confidence level. So this was at the end of the last slides. I want to go back and make sure we talked about this slowly and carefully because it's the only hard part about confidence intervals.  Everything else is the formula on the exam, right?  So it all came down to this x bar + or - 1.96 standard errors. That is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. So where this number 1.96 really come from?  Okay has to do if you're on a normal distribution.  And you go 1.96. That is about two standard deviations. That's exactly how far you need to go in order to get 95% of the area. Now, you memorize the number to that was me being kind right us being a proximate and we're just going to figure out how to be really precise about this. Okay. Now, how do you figure out how many standard deviations you have to go in order for something to happen?  Well, there's a problem on the homework that got you to see something to remember this from last night. The number of standard deviations you have to go. The number to grab a certain amount of area is the same as a question on a standard normal distribution. I'm just going a distance because the standard normal distribution has wiped away the idea of standard deviations. So just moving out is the same ideas moving out a certain number of standard deviations on some curve. So this amount of standard deviations you have to move which is playing the role of 1.96 right now. It's called the critical value and will use the notation Z Star for this.  So let me help you with a problem here. Let's say you wanted to have 90% confidence and our confidence is in the procedure that will make intervals. So the procedure does a pretty good job.  So what you do is supposed to drop picture.  And this picture is on the standard normal.  and all these pictures we've been thinking about try to get the central area to be a certain amount of  Of area so used to be 95, right? Well now you just put .9 here cuz the problem says 90% confidence.  So that immediately force is a certain amount of area in both Tales .05.  And then you say okay. Well, how do I figure out how to get this? What I care about right now? Is this place right here? This is d-star. No, unfortunately the tables are set up. So they start accumulating area all the way from negative Infinity.  But we don't actually care about that set up. So we will have to do is reframe our picture so that it works in this new setup.  So what you do is you say okay, I don't care about this .05 area, but I need to temporarily think about it.  And I need to think about the point 9 which I do care about and together. Those are .95. And so what I'm going to do is a reverse lookup on the table. I'm going to go look for the number .95 in the table.  And that will tell me the place on the horizontal axis. Okay, so you could do this in or if you wanted.  Just use Accu Norm command to figure out a quantile. So we'd like to figure out the place where 95% of the area is below it and keep a cool thing about this is it has the 90% of the area we do care about has a 5% that we don't care about.  And that's fine. Okay, so you can get 1.64. You can also go to the table and go look for .95 and then back to ride out to the ends.  So if you piece it together you get 1.6 for now when you're looking in the table.  It's quite frustrating, right .95 is not one of the numbers is between these two. So the truth is I don't care which one you choose again. You're worrying about things that matter very little just a phenomenon. You really studying perfectly normal, probably not. So you're getting all worked up about something. You need not get worked up about. So what feels weird to most students is we cared about getting then Central Area to be 49, but we end up looking up a result on the table. That's .95 and it's just it has to do with the difference between what we care about and how the table is structured. We brought them into alignment.  I looking up .95 we get this area that we didn't care about in that area and all that matters is getting this spot.  Now that's an answer on a standard normal curve.  So that number on a standard normal if you lift it back up to your setting becomes a number of standard deviations is what happens?  Okay. So this is how you change the confidence level you find this thing called sea star.  You want to try?  Let's see if you can use it.  A quick little check to make sure you know what's going on here 40 aliens. You want to know their average weight in the population. So in your sample, or sorry height in your sample of 62 with the standard deviation. So, let's see. If you can give me a 90% confidence interval for the true height if you were able to talk to all aliens ever.  No, it's interesting as you would hope that people would look at the slides. We don't get too and so should have already done this and yet the room is sort of a mess right now. So let me remind you. First of all, you're going to build a confidence interval. You need the confidence interval formula if x bar plus or minus.  Something really hard to figure out times a standard error.  Okay. Now on the last side we just figured out the hard thing. That is how many standard errors. Do you have to reach out to grab 90% of those green dots?  That was the number 1.64.  Okay. So one thing you'll notice is  If you compared to what's going on, when we do 95% confidence, we're not making the interval is wide.  1.64 and 1.966 smaller, right? So if you make the interval less wide, it's not going to capture that vertical line Muse often. That's fine. That's what we intended. We lower the confidence level.  Okay. Now the standard error is just the standard deviation of the sampling distribution that Sigma over the square root of an but here. We don't have Sigma that's a population idea has a Greek letter. So we approximate it with what's going on in our sample. So here's three is what we saw up at the top and there were 40 aliens in our sample. So that's a fine.  And then finally you just plug everything in X bar is what's going on in your sample. The average there is 62 inches.  So you play everything in and you should get an upper and lower bounds to the center Bowl. You should include units on it to remind yourself that you're actually trying to measure.  Now, what does this mean when we get this thing?  Does this mean that me was in this?  Go ahead.  eventually  asymptotically  I'm asking about this one thing.  I don't want asymptotics.  Is Mew in this thing?  Maybe that's the best answer. I don't know. It's an interval, right? It could be green. It could be read as they were falling down. I don't know if it's green or red. So maybe it's beautiful answer the next question. Is there a 90% chance that me was in the centerfold?  Why do you shake your head? No?  I'm sorry.  Okay, you said it's a possible range?  It could be in there.  help  it's either in there or it's not those things seem like zero or one probabilities.  Okay the process.  mix intervals and 90% of those  Will capture Mew how is his one from the process? I don't know if it was a good one or a bad one either in there or not. So this particular thing doesn't have a probabilistic structure. So if you're going to write something up you could say that we are 90% confident that means the process has a 90% probability of making good intervals is just one of them so we have high hopes that the average height of all aliens on the planet is in ours, but we don't know and we'll never know. Welcome to science.  so frustrated  Okay, so there's the review of that now.  It's time for the tough moments here.  Halo guitar in a second  Okay, let's try another example.  Maybe this will help I find this is like a lot of things being tied together and it's very difficult to do it all at once really well, so let's try this how many Facebook friends  Do your friends have?  on average  Well, that's an interesting question. So you might have 2,000 Facebook friends be a friend collector.  You're probably not going to go to each of their sites their pages and look at their friend counts and averaged together $2,000.  That's exhausting. I don't want to do that. So you go to 30 and you look at their pages and you look at their friend's house and you averaged together. There's 30 numbers. This is how frenzied your friends are is what's going on in this problem. So you can an average of 325 with the standard deviation. So we're going to build an 80% confidence interval whenever you build a confidence interval for a population parameter and idea that is too big to try to go collect all the data and measure that's why you're building an interval in the first place. Okay. So here's the idea if the perimeter is the average Facebook friend count of all of the friends that you have.  Okay, first thing part of the conference interval formula requires finding this thing called the critical value Z Star. So what are we going to do here?  The problem says 80% So we're going to draw a picture where they're Central areas .8 will immediately fill in both tails with point one in point one. We don't care about that area, but we're going to need to know those numbers to facilitate figuring something out. Now. What we care about is the place right here where the red ends that City Star.  So you could go to our and use a cunan calculation. You've got a plow through .9 area to get to that place point one is we don't care about is uninteresting and .8 we do care about and that's getting to this place. So 1.28. That's a distance on a standard normal.  Occasionally if there's any distribution related to it. It's the number of standard deviations you have to move on that distribution to do anything.  Related to the area of .8. Hey, so there's a star now. We're ready to build the interval. So this the first time I truly shown you the confidence interval formula and it's true generality. We've been working with all these specific cases. So the formula is always xbar your best gas plus or minus a number of standard deviations, which is with Z star is and hear the standard deviations are on the X bar distribution.  The sampling distribution, so it's called SE and then you just fill in everything that's going on.  But one thing you'll notice is Sigma / \u221a and it's still unusable. It's always going to be unusable.  Unless you have a super contrived problem.  And someone gives you signal somehow so we'll just use that side backs.  And now we just put in all the numbers.  It's a business anytime. Someone asks you to go to confidence interval. This is the procedure. So if there's some part of this you don't understand like what is East are like what's going on there look back and try to figure out and understand all the components. Why do we use Sigma over the square root of an that's another question. Why does xbar make a central appearance in all of this? There's so many components to this get an interview with the end. And the last thing you want to be able to do is interpret this now, this is the messiest part.  for most of society  so in this class will use this phrase 80% confident.  because the problem said that  that's not 80% probability is not 80% chance. It's a weird word. It gets us away from probability intentionally. So this interval came from a procedure that makes intervals most of those intervals coming out asymptotic Lee.  80% of them will capture the thing we care about our particular interval. It's one of them. I don't know if it's a winner or loser but has a high chance of being a winner.  And that's it. So this is how you build intervals.  So this gives you a good sense of what's going on with your population parameter. There's a very high chance.  Did Arvin intervals are good one and if it's a good one, it means Mew is between 3:19 and 3:30, which means the friendliness of your friends.  Has a really high chance of being in there.  I don't know if this interval has it but whatever. Okay, so you have a real good sense of where the idea lives that you're trying to study and that's nice know if this is a bad interval.  The true average could be a billion. You're the friendliest friends ever befriend everyone in the world. And this is just a crummy interval or something.  Okay, but it gives you a sense which is kind of cool. Okay. So again, what you've got here is your best guess X bar for what you're trying to measure and you padded it. Now. The padding amount is called the margin of error.  So you go marching bear to the right and a margin of error to the left.  It is just a name to help quantify the pad oenis.  and the padding it is influenced by how good you wanted the confidence level to be which gets encoded in Z star and  the phenomenon you're studying and how tightly controlled it is or isn't because SE will have Sigma / \u221a end. So the sigma is reflecting how tightly controlled the original population is in the NHRA sample size to bring us together all that information into one.  Okay. So every time you have an interview with the with will be total with me to margins of error cuz you went left one and right one. So sometimes people talk in the margins of error. You've probably seen this when they do political polls and they say, oh Pete buttigieg is current approval rating among Democrats. I saw this is morning 8% and then at the bottom of the screen in tiny font, it says margin of error.  Colon, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. So that was a really trying to say is that Buddha shares number?  There's a huge window.  That we think it probably lives in we're just going to report out.  The average we got in our sample.  Okay.  Now let's talk about the messiest thing in the whole course.  What's about to happen if we're going to talk about something known as hypothesis testing and I'm going to try to be super careful about everything?  But what happens is all this dirt gets into people's minds.  and then  8 years from now I teach a different course for you called 296c that shows how broken all of this thinking is and how dirty it is. So good to be very careful with Lutz about to happen because it's so prone to misconceptions.  More on that in a second. Anyhow, sometimes in life I hate to break it to you.  You have to make a binary decision and I hate that more than anything else. For example, should we release this drug and put it on Market or not? There's no in-between, right?  Are we going to declare this person innocent or guilty binary decision one of two options?  So what we need is a framework to help us make those kinds of binary decisions and luckily confidence intervals can help us do this. Okay, so first thing  People set of hypotheses all the time. And this will be called the hypothesis testing framework HT.  And what we're going to start doing is setting up a null and alternative hypothesis. Those are the binary things were going to study and life. Okay. Now whenever you define hypothesis in this class, it should be about a population parameter or parameters something like this. If they maybe you think the weight of your friends is different than the weight of Americans notice I use Greek letters  We're talking about big honkin populations that have millions or thousands of people and you would never talk to all of them.  Okay, you might say something like well, my new drug increases people's happiness is more than when I give them a sugar pill known as a placebo.  There's another kind of hypothesis again population parameters. The only way you would ever measure the happiness increase of your new drug is giving it to everyone in America know this is a case. Where are you wouldn't want to do that. Perhaps your drug kills people. What's by America? So sometimes you don't want to measure the whole population because it's too dangerous.  So this is the case where you draw a sample, but you still like to try to make claims about it across the whole population.  Now, let's put some numbers on this so you can see what's going on and will start working through this maybe you know that when you get people sugar pills.  And you give everyone in the country sugar pill?  Hopefully it doesn't tell them and you say hey, there's this new drug for happiness take this pill and we all take it and then the next day or like are you happier and people say yeah. I'm happier by 1.9. Okay.  In order to get this information you give the sugar pill to everybody. That's how you figured out the population parameter. Okay. Now, let's try with our new drug. I'm very scared about the new drug. So I'm not giving it to everybody just a small sample. Okay in your sample with a small number of people you find the happiness increase is 2.3 x bar Latin notation. This is just in the same for a small number of people.  Now here's the thing. That's interesting about this is 2.3 + 1.9.  Obviously 2.3 is bigger than 1.9.  So the question is do you want to believe this statement right here, which has Muse all over the place.  See if you look at your point 3 in 1 .91 in Balsam you and the other involves an x-bar. So this is where it gets complicated. If you take a small number of people and do something to them and you get a result that seems promising.  Is it promising because there really is something interesting going on if you done with everybody which is with this statement a saying or is it promising because you got lucky and your sample is really prone to getting increased happiness.  Hey, there's a variation in X bar.  That's what the same thing distribution is. So what we need to do is figure out and sort out his knee increase do because the drug really works or was the increase just due to random variation.  There's another way you can think about it.  If you give everyone in the room a truly Fair coin and you say flip it 10 times.  The most people are going to get five heads, right?  But some of you out there are going to get eight or nine heads and you're sitting there if you just think about yourself for a moment with eight or nine heads you like did he really give me a Fair coin?  Or is this promising result just random variation and there's so many of you would get someone that had eight or nine heads, even though you're sitting there with a Fair coin. That's the frustrating thing. That's why you need statistics to sort out.  Is it just random variation is causing it and that's mainly what two players the really in effect where my coin is say headgear than everybody else is going.  And this is what the hypothesis testing infrastructure natural variation or Genuine difference. Okay. So let's start building and see all of the components we need here. So we need a rigorous way to sort out what's going on. So step on you write down a no hypothesis. Now, they're all different kinds of null hypothesis some things you should know.  It will always have an equal sign for you in this class.  It will always be a claim about population parameters. You don't need to make claims about your data because you see your data completely. There's nothing mysterious. I bought these are supposed to be things that have yet to be proven true or false that you're interested in.  Okay. Now finally, it's usually saying that nothing interesting is happening sort of us status quo or I would be bored if that were the case.  Okay, so here's some examples. I'd be bored if my friends wait exactly The American Average.  There's nothing to talk about there. Just an American basically is what it means it be super boring. If our drug was exactly the same as the pussy bow.  We wouldn't bring it to market, right?  Notice all these equal signs all these Greek letters. Okay might be really boring if your IQ is were 110. Okay, so sometimes the null hypothesis just involves a number that you're asserting is equal to your population parameter.  That I just randomly chose one time there.  Those are all the common features that you're going to see in a null hypothesis next. We need to have a binary alternative.  So something that is not the null hypothesis now when you do this, it's called the alternative.  And you're writing down what you're hoping will be true or suspecting or what would cause you to actually be able to make money in life.  So it sometimes this alternative lose and not equal to sign. You'll be super interesting in my friends Wade more or less than the average American.  If they weigh less, I'd come up with some logic like oh all my friends are in shape and the exercise constantly if they weighed more maybe I'd say something like, oh, they're all lazy akademiks. You don't have time to exercise. So I come up with some theory behind whatever results and I be excited either way. Now if you're building a drug that's supposed to increase happiness only excited about it being better than the placebo greater than  A less than sign would be bad for you. You be underperforming a sugar pill?  Now that case you could Market it as a downer I suppose but which it really is you care about it being an upper in the happiness. Okay. Now if using not equal to sign is known as a two-sided alternative because there's this Valley that's been posited in the Knoll and the alternative says either side of that would be cool and sexy.  But if you use a greater than or less than sign is known as a one-sided alternative. Maybe just want to be on the bigger side of the placebo and doing better than some people often refer to one and two-sided alternative says language now when you're riding the alternative  Here's your pro-tip.  You read the problem statement to decide what the experimenters are the people doing the experiment cared about. What do you think? They were hoping to see you? Don't look at the data to make decisions. Okay, the way science works. If done well is you set some belief system in advance.  Then you collect data then you decide if the data support or refute the hypothesis that's called science.  Now if you do it the other way and you take your data and you say let's look for cool patterns and decide what's true in life and then former hypotheses. That's how data science it goes the other way.  Edelbrock high-level Gators a dirty metaphor for you, so  So don't look at the numbers in the problem to decide on the hypotheses. Look on the words that are going on. Now comes the hard part of how do you choose?  No, I think it the first time I saw this I said this is the most awkward thing I've ever seen what a weird way to go through and decide between two options. But the truth is it really do this in real life? And as soon as I saw that that I was doing it, I was like, oh, this is Supernatural. Okay. So how does life work? You adopt some belief?  Maybe you think you should be a CS major lots of people in the room think this right?  And you will live with this as a belief. It doesn't make it true and doesn't make it false you just live with it.  It's your current belief, right? So then what happens you go collect some data and you see how those data relate to that assumption that you currently believed in. So are you taking your CS class member algorithms?  I know this is killing my soul or this is the coolest thing I've ever taken and there's data show you whether your assumption that you should be a CS major was a good idea or not. Okay. So every time the data support and confirm what you were thinking in your soul you continue to believe that thing and you keep being a CS major, but if you're double e class was the sexy thing and you hated writing things in C plus plus in Java then maybe you should change your belief system. Maybe you shouldn't be a CS major and you should be a EE  So can you believe something?  You collect the data and you see if they triangulate toward that truth or away from that truth in your soul.  And regardless of what happens in the process continues in your data and ever triangulating toward. What should be your truth.  Okay. Now let's do it in general.  Assume the null is true. That's how it always begins. In fact, it's so frequently done. That is always that you sometimes forget that this stuff exists in the hypothesis testing framework and then you go collect some data now how we going to decide if the data support the Knoll or refute the Knoll  Well one way is to build a confidence interval around your data.  And see if that confidence interval maybe contains the parameter value specified or not.  Okay, so we'll see this in a moment. If the parameter doesn't fall into if it does fall into our interval, that's great the date I can come up with his own.  It inside the zone is the value you currently believe.  Should be the value for the parameter. Okay, it's possible that the value in your null hypothesis is not in the centerfold. So there were going to go reject H not because of the two options that come out of this hypothesis testing or peep the Knoll.  If the data supported what you believed or reject?  Now if you taking stop before like AP Stat in high school, maybe you had failed to reject.  the Knoll  and reject the null I think that's the silliest thing ever. How about the word keep?  instead of fail to reject  If you've never heard fail to reject great, you don't need to ever hear it again.  So there was a the options in life. Now. What's really important here?  When you make a decision about which way you're going to go keeping or rejecting the null it doesn't mean that the null is true, and it doesn't mean that the nose false. It doesn't mean the alternative is true or the alternative is false.  Statistics does not prove things are true and false.  It triangulate you toward a belief system that resonates and harmonizes with the data coming at you from the universe.  We have no way of knowing was actually true and false in this universe.  Sorry to break your soul there.  Science isn't the search for truth. It's the triangulation toward a belief system that harmonizes with the data coming from the universe.  Maybe you think that's called truth. It's not called truth. You have to call up the universe and say hey what's going on? It is Newtonian mechanics true.  No, sorry, it's not true.  Is quantum mechanics true know there was a paper 2 days ago. It's a quantum mechanics is probably the universe so all we've been doing historically triangulating for things that resonate more with the universe. Okay, Newtonian mechanics started falling apart when pawn something started appearing right in Quantum things are starting to fall apart. So we need a new thing or just triangulating the same thing is true in medicine. There's just saying that every 50 years half of things written in medical books are proven not to be consistent with what's actually going on. Okay. We don't suck blood using beaches anymore, right?  Okay, but that was like in medical books for a long time. So stop thinking about what's true and false cuz you never going to get that.  Okay. Now how do we actually operationalize all of this stuff? So right now we did steps 1/2 do we have a null and alternative? We have a metaphor for what we're going to do moving forward. So we're going to assume the nose true. This is what you currently believe. We're going to go collect some data and we're going to see  Okay, so let's try this for example with some data.  You read the average American weighs 182.5 that's a population parameter idea about all Americans.  Ua20 random friends that sounds like a sample that sounds like it's related to if you would done all your friends, which is a population that's too big for you to measure cuz you have so many friends right now. He's in ten thousands on Facebook.  Anyhow your friends you get an average of 175 but this standard deviation. So the question is is the average weight of all your friends. There's a population idea different from the national average.  So we can start operationalizing this framework now. So first of all, I did step 22, I wrote the novel that has an equal sign. It uses a parameter here. The only population we care about studying is our friends. We completely understand all Americans the numbers right here when 82.5 now, it'd be really boring if my friends were just like America.  That's why I put an equal to sign and hear I put a two-sided alternative.  Because that would be cool to me. The problem doesn't give tons of hints about what kind of alternative one-sided versus two-sided to use there. So I just gave it to you if I'm going to give you problems and had to be clear and suggest somehow what the alternative should be.  now when you assume the Knoll  the first little image in that metaphor, right?  What's cool about the note as it has an equal sign?  And so it says okay you think your friends?  R180 2.5 X Universe you think that they're going to be centered here? And if you go ask 20 of them in the average it you're expecting to get numbers near 182.5 cuz that's what you believe but you recognize that there is variation from one sample to the next song is Green Dots here or those averages from lots of different samples of size 20.  That what we're going to do is go put down our average on this picture.  So what do we get 175 so that's about right here. So that is kind of low.  In this picture you might say how low is it is a too low. Is it too far away from 182.5?  What if we had suppose 182.5 and gotten an average of 60 lb  That is so far away from 182.5 that we just don't believe that that distribution could spit out the number 60. It's just so unlikely.  Okay, so we're going to build a 95% confidence interval now around our data and it will give us a zone that we think is reasonable for what our friend average weight is.  Okay. So here's the confidence interval formula X bar plus or minus V-Star which will play the role of 1.96.  CSE the standard deviation of the sampling distribution the way that xbar can vary how much it can vary by so I put all the numbers in and we get this interval.  Okay, so our data suggested 175, but we recognize variability and happened. So we've had it.  Then we make an interval that has a really good chance of capturing the true thing in it. Okay. So here's our interval. 168-2181.  So the only question is is the value you currently believe.  In that interval or not. This is the reasonable range, right? Okay, but 180 2.5 ain't in it.  So you currently believe something that does not harmonize with the date of the universe are giving you.  the universe gave you the data 175  you patted it because the universe is variability and it's still not in the patents owned.  So I don't really want to believe what I used to believe in life. So we're going to reject H not I like to use this phrase in favor of the alternative. We're just moving to a new belief system.  Now the new belief system says nothing more than the average isn't 182.5 doesn't tell us a bigger or less than  these data are suggesting. Maybe it's less.  So maybe in the future you could come up with a new value for the Knoll and maybe you should start looking downward towards smaller values.  Okay, let's try one problem.  Before we end here. We'll see if you can do this. I love this problem.  Maybe you've heard of the golden rectangle the Greeks label. This is such it's the rectangle that looks prettiest to the human eye.  Whatever that means and they decided that this ratio of how long vs. How wide it should be should be this number Point 618. You can also take the reciprocal of that ratio 1 point something 1.6 which is the golden ratio. Maybe you've heard this before.  Did they call up the universe and figure out the truth?  If so, then all of us.  Should be perpetuating that truth.  If you go to some indigenous tribe in the middle of nowhere that makes rectangles.  You would hope that maybe day would stumble upon the same truth. Okay. So is this really anesthetic standard or do all the examples that we see of rectangles and current Society is popping with the Greeks did  So he's an interesting question so he would be that.  Point 618 is from standard and you should see across all societies that have been alive long enough. Everyone sees the same Beauty in the world. OK and the alternative is the only reason this number pops up in current times. It's just because Greeks influence everybody. So here's what happens.  And they went and measured the aspect ratio the W / l in 20 random beaded rectangles. And here's the aspect ratio average they got  You're so spread out the aspect ratios were and here's how many.  Self construct a 95% CI and see if we should keep believing in the Greek aesthetic ideal or whether that doesn't make any sense.  Okay, break out the CPI formula plug all the numbers in you should have gotten .62 up 2.702.  This is saying based on the data and the recognition of the variability that happens in life. My best guess for the Shoshoni aspect ratio average.  Is in this Zone somewhere in there those could be a bad interval, but you'll never know so I have to hope it's a good interval now, you'll notice the interval. So believing in this number as anesthetic standard is foolish if it was a standard than the Shoney's would have discovered it but they clearly don't believe the same aspect ratio is the ideal.  Okay, so if you see this point 618 and societies, it's mostly historical tradition according to this paper. So we have a good day everyone.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
