    "Full Transcript": "Good morning.  To kick things first one. Congratulations  I woke up to no emails about homework to grade scope issues. Thank you. I only woke up to 25 other emails about things.  I appreciate you not fighting my inbox with nonsense.  Second for those who are actually in the room right now, you'll notice there were fewer people here.  if you look at the list of the top five things you can do to improve your education and dramatically alter your grade in a course actually showing up and taking notes by hand is in the top 5  so those people at home you're making a micro choice that will have a macro impact that something you might want to reconsider on a daily basis if you plan on not coming to class anymore, but I'll let you make your own choices in life.  And we'll see how they go for you.  So I'm glad to see everyone who is here. Let him prove what you can do and add new rules to your big list.  So here's what we are. Do you want a high level of you and starting to organize?  when someone puts in or between events, if the events are disjoint you now know you can just add them individually, but as you saw in the homework  If the ideas are not disjoint, then suddenly have to subtract there overlap because it has now been counted twice.  We also saw that when events are independent if you put an end, this is the easy situation you just get to multiply.  The question is what happened in general if you don't have Independence.  Well, the truth is you already know what to do.  The rule has been presented just not exactly in the way you've been thinking. So we ended after some discussion of contingency tables with this rule P of a given B. You want to find the conditional probability of contingency table? We limited our universe to be and then we tried to find a also with in there and we came up with this formula for those that thoroughly looked through all the slides even the ones we don't get to that was just beautiful visit visualization about balls dropping from the students at Brown help you understand a conditional probabilities that's irrelevant now except to it suggest maybe you want to go do all the things that we don't get to in the slides to enrich your understanding. That's why I create them. Anyhow, if you rearrange this and just I sleepy of A and B. Now you have a rule that always works and tells you the probability.  Two things when they're joined together. So what you can do as you can add that to a little list here, and now you have the complete list of rules that are actually helpful and making progress in life.  Okay, so we're going to spend a lot of time looking at this second rule today.  Now as I've always said when you learn big fancy rules, they better collapsed to the gentle easy rules. If you just start adding on conditions, let's check it what happen if in this general setting you suddenly know that A and B are independent.  Well this turn right here the conditional probability actually just collapses down to pee of a because that's how independent events work. If a and b are independent telling me be a kiss me no useful information about finding a so, it's just like I'm finding a without anyting which is 40 of a means. So this will collapses to the top 1  in the case of independent events  It's so beautiful. Now, you know the rules probably true. It works in one strange case. Maybe that's not enough data for you to believe something. I don't know.  Okay, so what's you're talking about independent and dependent events more so you can get a feeling so you're sort of a classic problem that demonstrates the difference and you start with balls because they're easy to deal with this red and green balls here and there's some bag so you're going to reach in and you're going to grab two balls.  Now when you doing this, there's a different ways you can do it one way is to do it sort of one at a time. And if you're doing that one at a time, then I need to know after you draw the first ball and you look at it when you write down its color. Are you going to put it back in the bag or you going to leave it out? Those are your two options, right?  So if you decide to put it back in the bag, this is called with replacement.  You have replaced it back in.  now if you reach in and grab two balls simultaneously  There's no way this could be with replacement because grabbing them at the same time effectively means you couldn't grab the same thing twice, but if you replace the balls, you could grab one put it back and then grab it again.  So whenever you see with replacement, it's easiest just to think about doing it one at a time and replacing it and then drawing again.  So let's start there. Now. I'm going to find some events just so we can be good about this and you can see how one would set up notation if you wanted to be really thorough. So one of them could be about the first ball being red and the other could be about the second ball, which is drawn second.  Okay, and I'd love for both of them to happen because that makes the event that were excited about.  That one cool thing is these events are not affected by one another if the first ball comes out red great. I don't care because you're about to put it back and when you do so it's reestablish has the original status of the bag as a certain amount of Readiness and a certain amount of green oenis.  okay, so that's helpful because now the event I care about is just a and b  I want them both to occur. And since they're independent I can just use the standard multiplication rule it is when I go for be no information information about is needed so we can just use two out of five the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls in the bag.  Okay, so whenever you see with replacement, this is in some sense a synonym for I'm trying to create an independent event structure because I'm always returning the bag to its original state.  So we can contest that with the other language statisticians in probability Theory shoes, which is without replacement.  Play so here's the same problem, but I headed out for the word with and now it's a lot more complicated.  Oh my goodness. What are we going to do?  Well, this is actually pretty slick the first time you see it. I love this guy. So first thing he suddenly dependent on a Now give me some emotional talking at this.  Raise your hand, please. Go ahead.  Okay, so you automatically go from five things to four things. So the denominator when it comes time to pull the second ball is suddenly a different number but doesn't necessarily mean.  That the fraction ratio has changed.  Off and it does go ahead.  Okay. So now you're thinking about the numerator. I love both of your logic together is brilliant. If you happen to get a red ball in the first one when it comes time to try to get one on the second one, there's less red stuff than there was before the numerator is also changed now just because the numerator and denominator changes doesn't mean that the second ball can't have the same experience as the first  Okay by 2/8 is equal to 1/4 different numerators different denominators, but the experiences the same but together the emotion suggests that we probably have some sort of dependence. So let's just go figure it out and you'll see this in the numbers. So if a occurs, there's only one red left among the four balls. Okay. It's not easy for a fraction as a 5 in the denominator to be in the denominator something about prime factorization blah blah blah. So anyhow, if a occurs B is now suddenly less likely to occur than it was if you didn't draw the ball.  How do you do this notation Ali we still want both A and B to occur.  But what you do and using this formula right here is you create a conditioning expression.  Now if you look back at the formula, we had a couple slides Argo you can see what it says. It says if you have a and b you could put pee and pee and then pee of a given B. We can also do it in the other order if you want, which is what I'm writing in this problem. Okay, you can do PA and PF be given a and it's because you can just switch the order hear of a and be sober versus the roles of A and B everywhere. Here's how I think about this my goal in life is to get both balls red. So here's what I'm going to do. When I write T of a that's trying to sort of make the first ball red. It's explaining the probability of my head. I'm just thinking make the first ball red and then this expression is saying if you've made the first all red  Then go ahead and make the second ball red and that's how I'm creating the double redness. But since they depend on each other, I can't do it. Like I did in the previous problem and just sort of ignore that they have effects on each other here. I have to sort of condition down and say let's make D happen only once a day has happened.  Okay, so hopefully these numbers are 1/4 and 2/5 the first ball draw their Phi ball still in into a red and then you draw the second one. You're right. The denominator is now changed to 4, which is brilliant and you're right also, cuz the numerator is changed to 1.  And we didn't get the number to Fitz like we did in the same problem 1/4 can't be 2/5 no matter how hard I try.  Is another way to see that things are dependent. So now it's a 1 out of 10 event.  Okay, there you go. So this is how you deal with dependent events. You should have create this string or this ordering in which the problem is going to happen. So let me show you this.  Make a tree diagram are first tree diagram ever.  This will be a big moment. Maybe been doing this your whole life, but you never thought about it as deeply as we're about to original bag with red and green balls when you draw that first one out.  You're either going to get a red or green unless you fail in life and can't pull a ball out of a bag.  And what you can do if you can write probabilities over these directional arrows here, which route are you going to go down? So they is just a thing for doing the red ball and over here will always be the compliment if they didn't occur its complement occurred and these numbers over these are was mustad to one because something has to happen in life when you approach a fork in the road.  There's a 100% chance you'll do something.  Now what school is you can help explore what's going to happen for the second ball in each case, but the settings are totally different right if you drew a red initially now, there's less red stuff.  And if you do agree now, there's less green stuff. So when it comes time to figure out the second ball, here's a visualization that will show you and now you can go put numbers on everything. Here's the key thing and their hours on Monday who didn't get that. They're working ahead. Okay, when you put a probability over II branching system. These are conditional probabilities.  You are finding a probability about the second ball. But look you have already made a decision about the first ball because you are in one of the branches.  So tree diagrams are beautiful way to represent conditional probabilities.  Because the structure of the tree forces you to go down pads that is it makes events occur.  Okay. So here's some probability. You can just look at the picture to see the numbers. Here's a compliment and over here you get 2/4 and 2/4.  okay, so if the events are independent, which they're not  then the numbers you see over the second branching system would have to be identical it would say doesn't matter what path you go down initially.  My decision-making apparatus henceforward looks the same.  Okay, but the number systems all look different here from the top half to the bottom half that's another way to see if we have dependent events. Now you could imagine taking a complete walkthrough this branch in system. So maybe go up at the first and down at the second will what you created is a red ball and a green ball. In fact that the first of all was a red ball in the second ball was a green ball. Maybe I don't care about witches which you just care. I got one red and one green at the end. Okay, so here are the results if you completely walkthrough.  And if you multiply the numbers along the branches.  As you're going in this tree diagram, then you will get the probability of ending up with this final result and you can see like ears are one out of ten. We just figure it out, right?  No, nothing will notice if you go all the way through the tree and create a combination of what's going on where you made two decisions of night. This is actually in and so the joint probabilities are at the very least nodes after you truly gone through everything and accumulated all of your balls along the way.  So getting between marginal and conditional and we see joint at the very end.  And this is a nice visualization. Our previous ones didn't have a nice way of doing conditional things today.  Venn diagram did almost nothing great.  The contingency table did a little more but we had to think cleverly on how to get conditional stuff in there by limiting our universe and here's a very natural way. So choose your visualization. Why is based on the kinds of probabilities you have this is something to think about  Now they're saying is if you can explore all possibilities here, right? So one thing you may care about is the problem with giving one red and one green and if the person doesn't care, which ball was the red or green, they just send me and want to see one red and one green you'll see that that's actually these two events combined so the or statement of either of these just add them together.  Okay. So here's the general tree if you like things in generality and you don't learn through a specific example, which is some percentage of this room. You can always split based on some of vente Paca and not a and you can put the probabilities of a in its complement on there and let that to one there's some second event. You would like to explore after the first event has absolutely occurred. Okay, so maybe it's called be for you. You're still CB and not be and you're right this exact same thing down here and these are going to be conditional probabilities.  Because you must have done something about a or not a in order to get to the second choice in life. So this kind of weird you went down and you want to go down again.  Okay, at the end of this if you walk completely through you will have accumulated two things and you're looking at their join you've made them both occur. So here of all of our joint events and they have joint probabilities. If you don't like the work not you can use compliments all over the place. That's fine with me also.  Now I love tree diagrams to show all three things in a very natural way. Now it sometimes you don't list the stuff at the very end on the right side.  The Joint probabilities you just say like if I needed to create such a thing I would go think about it and walk through the tree  Okay, you ready to try some things?  Progresso difficulty  Let's see where you fall apart.  Hopefully not at all.  I want everyone to get a hundred now. Some people didn't grow up in America with our stupid deck of cards.  If you didn't ears are stupid deck of cards, it looks different than your deck of cards. It's totally random. We have 52 there's half black half red there for things called suits.  Within each suit, it goes a stew through 10 and Jack queen king. Typically you called Jack queen king the face cards because there are pictures of human beings with faces on them. The ace does not have a picture of a human being so it's not a face card in some stupid American Games Ace is low and other stupid American Games Aces High look arbitrary nonsense, right arbitrary nonsense in this country probability of drawing a face card.  There we go. So you see what happens if I don't explain what a face card is only 70% of the people get this correct, which is 30 people in the room. Don't know the American Deck system. But if you explain that you can see so many things of people getting things wrong in life are just definitional things.  black card or queen  going to make it hard on yourself. Don't look at the picture when I show it for sure self to imagine it in your head. Whenever you're bored figure out ways to make the cognitive load on you harder.  By using my resources less.  So will this be less than 99% Correct if it's progressed, so it should we're going to wait a little bit longer.  Uh, oh.  Look at all you a people you a people are not thinking about the fact that there's a join between these two. There are black cards that are queen and you have double counted them because you did this whole row this whole row and then you counted this column of all queens and hence these two got counted twice.  Okay, people won't make that mistake anymore draw two cards without replacement.  What's the probability of getting two black cards?  vocabulary  Oh no longer Progresso. I'm going to reorder these now.  Do you guys perform differently? Okay, you can see like look at these answers answer is the people who are doing with replacement, right?  Okay, it be known even want it. So I'll change that to something more tempting but people love things that look complicated.  So sometimes if you don't know what you're doing and she's complicated things, but you know that I know that you're going to do that.  So you can't use as a way to decide things in life are drawing a king and drawing a black card disjoint.  Did you just look for the cards on the screen and feel something emotionally when I wouldn't put them up?  I forced the cognitive load onto you rather than onto the visualization on the screen.  Try this one was easy enough that you could probably handle that cognitive load. Okay, if they're disjoint, all you have to do is say is there anything that means both definitions? There's a black king, right? They're not just joint. They have a joint.  Are these events independent?  Random guessing would have been better.  Okay, so when you're looking at these I say that not to like shame. I don't believe in chain with an idea but to show you like.  You should be looking how much above 50% it. Is it right? No.  Vikas Gupta trade if you gas, so you probably saw the exclamation here they show up right. So you play this game you first say what's the probability of one of these things happening? It doesn't matter which one you focus on I focused on Kings. Okay. So therefore Kings out of the 50 to 1 and 13  Okay. Now we're going to play the game again and think about Kings but suppose, you know that the card drawn is black.  Okay, so then you say what the probability of getting a king? So you limit yourself to the top Universe here which has 26 cards and you can see their two kings here. So 2 out of 26 and what you're hoping to get is the same number if you get the same numbers that things are independent.  Is very strange that these events are independent. Obviously, it's the kind of thing that you might have an intuition about that will lead you the wrong direction. So you have to sit there and just play the game. That's how you decide about independence.  It also shows that things can be independent yet. Not disjoint.  Cuz you saw the previous problem, right?  So you can have one of the words without the other two cards without replacement probability of an app drawing both red.  Ann Black  What percent will get this correct?  Hey, there, we go, 2/3 of the room.  Okay, so a super tempting. I remember the day I made this mistake in my life. I'm very good at remembering all the mistakes I've ever made. I don't know. I just like it's something I can do. I just memorize the layout of buildings instantaneously who's like to migrate skills in life. I suck at everything else, of course. So the people that shows they just didn't realize there's two ways to make this event have a red card and then a black card.  Which is this right here, or you could have black card and then a red card?  Are these people up here? Let's see 26 out of 52 that makes a red card 25 out of 51.  Give me some Heather red card or something. The denominator got less. So you're clearly choosing from the same world used to choose from. Okay, this multiplication by 2 is super tempting. It has the right idea there. You're building something to Waze, but it doesn't necessarily do it appropriately.  Another thing you'll notice if you multiply that out.  You get the answer?  1  probability of 1 means  must occur  something feels wrong about that.  You simplify the answer from the past problem going to get 26 / 51?  If you knew that was the answer, could you come up with a clever way?  To instantly know that the answer to the last problem.  What's 26 / 51?  There's often a clever way to resync how you set up your events.  You could set up the first event as a first card red and event B is second card Black.  And then you would also need to set up a his first card Black and be a second card read and then add those together. So so that's what we did before right? What if you set up event a s draw any card?  What's the probability of that?  1  and what if your second event was look at your first card and try to draw the opposite colored suit?  So that is how you get 26 / 51.  So it's One X. Well, there's 26 cards of the other colored suit cuz none of them have been chosen yet. And there's 51 cards in the deck. This is the clever way to define the events to make this problem super easy.  You draw a red or black first. They have same probability. We don't care the color of the first card. We just need to color the second car to be different. There we go.  too vague  these people just multiplying things together.  ligma meme  fixing one card find the other is 26 choices from 51 options. Nice.  Try tree diagram.  Okay, some people have are super clever answer. I like that. So that's a kind of clever trickery.  That is very hard to think of but once you've seen the trick you like maybe I could do this in the future somehow.  So don't beat yourself up over that if you couldn't figure that out.  I could have thought of something that cover when I was younger.  So much of life is just training. That's it.  If the events are independent, so the question is does the trick depend on Independence Independence actually does so if events are independent those kinds of Tricks tend not to do much because the system is always reduced to its original state and you just look at it originally just for them do whatever you need to do. But because it's dependent suddenly now, there's an order in which things are happening or you could imagine in order. Okay. So when you draw the first one you can decide what you want to do with it. Do you care exactly its color or do you just care that it has a color and that's exactly what it's doing. It has a color right and now because there's a string of events in life now. I can just make things behave oppositely of whatever that color happens to be.  Is a brilliant question no one has ever asked that ever that I've seen in thousands and thousands of students. So if you stand way apart instantly from that question.  Okay, any of you like board games for take away these incredibly complex Euro board games with big rulesets like Settlers of Catan.  D&D  maybe you do. Well when I was in graduate school, I got obsessed with all this stuff.  Okay, so here's a problem like that.  I love these.  You need to kill some enemy that has three Health points.  But usually these games are super complicated and there's all sorts of nonsense. So here's how this game decides how much damage you can deal to this enemy spinning dial comes up with a K. Probably two-thirds be probability 1/3 you could also think about this is an unfair coin instead of a spinner. What is the same thing if you got a four-sided die, and otherwise you roll a six-sided die if there's no mention of whether it's fair or not. You should assume it's fair.  If there's no mention of how it's numbered, you should assume it has a number and 1 through whatever.  Okay, your role that you get is the amount of damage you get to do. What's the probability the enemy dies? So I'd like you to try to do this draw me a tree diagram also in your answer and I'll give you 3 minutes.  I love it when I come up to people and they're like is this correct? This is something we have to change all the social contract contract that's in this class. I am not the Arbiter of Truth.  You should become the Arbiter of Truth. You should be able to decide if it's right or not. You should have confidence in what you're doing. So don't make the textbook or me or anybody else the Arbiter of what's true and not  Okay, first thing that happens if you spin the spinner and it's land you either so using dye or Dye B. Are you still using dice in the singular? No.  Add my fitness class we have this thing called the dice the dye. They called the dice cuz I don't know what the plural word but it has things like a hundred calories on assault bike 25 burpees. And if you like leave your clothing or like spill something or forget to put up your weights. You have to roll the die.  And do something horrible.  But it says roll the dice.  Right above where it's it's all the time. It's so frustrating to me.  Okay, 2/3 1/3 you probably put the numbers on those are the probabilities you end up using those implements in life. Now when you split it up the next thing all you really care about the important event is getting a 3 or higher. So that is how you can divide the second stage here. Now on the six-sided die will be more things in the 3 or higher category there on the four-sided die. That's okay split based on how you want it in life. Not on how many sides it happens to come with that's an irrelevant feature of the diet.  Okay, so that will affect the numbers of course 2/4 vs46.  Now you want to take a journey on the street and walk through it. Your goal is to get to this 3 or higher you're so you have to go through diet and then makes a 3 or higher occur so multiply those and that will effectively created the idea of 3 or higher it also creates the idea of die a in the past, but that's irrelevant to me that I kill the enemy just happening to use diet.  Okay down here. You can multiply through and you get three or higher. It happens to also have a joint of diabetes, but I'm ignoring that cuz that's irrelevant to me. So I see there two ways to create 3 or higher. I can only add them together if they are disjoint.  Are they disjoint?  Well, this expression right here is 3 or higher and higher and diabetes. So they are disjoint because they happen to use different died. So I couldn't simultaneous to be occurring because different I are involved different dicer involved.  So they were going to 5/9.  How did you emotionally feel when you saw the flight weirdness of that answer?  One bothered. Okay good.  Now it's time for the most important result in probability Theory at this level is known as Bayes theorem is named after Thomas Sir Thomas Reverend Thomas Thomas Reverend. I don't know how you do it when you have too many names to you when I arrive it so it won't seem like some magical result. And this was cutting edge in 1620 Sophie go back 400 years. This is like the Forefront of knowledge. You can see where you are. You've made it four hundred years from where we are. So here's a fact about how to find a joint probability. If you think about conditioning now, I just changed the role of A and B everywhere in that statement. You just reverse is all the A's and B's and it gives you another way to think about finding the probability of A and B, which is the same as being a matter which one you're listing first and on the page, right? That's just not random.  So what you could do is you could take these two different expressions for p of A and B.  And you could set them equal to each other and what you're really setting evil to each other are the complicated equivalents of them that use the conditioning.  So apparently the probability of a given b x the probability of B is going to have to be equal to the probability of B given a x a in this makes some sense without even thinking hard if your goal in life is to get both A and B to occur, you can imagine it making be first and then making a after bee has occurred or vice versa make a occur and then let be follow it in the end. You have both A and B.  Now you can just rearrange this by dividing through by p a b and you get What's called the simple version of Base theorem.  Now this doesn't seem like anything special until you look at it. Just the right way. And sometimes that's what you need out of a big theorem. What does it do for us?  If you look here it says if you ever want to find the probability of a given B.  Well, here's a new way to do it.  You can find the probability of B given a  And then X bunch of nonsense.  Now what value might this bring?  Sometimes it really helps to think about things in a certain order.  And sometimes the problem asked you about an order that very weird see this has be appearing first, and then you're exploring a there after.  But this has a way of thinking about it. So you get to assume a happens first, which might be a more natural way and then you can explore be and then you just have to multiply by some marginal stuff.  Okay, so it allows you to reverse the ordering of conditioning simple version of Base.  The fancy version of Base actually turns out to be more useful. So he was the more complicated version. All I've done is keep everything the same except the denominator p a v  I've expanded into something big and complicated using something known as the law of total probability. So he was the idea.  Often these problems. You won't actually know POV.  Okay, that's not obvious why that would be the case. I'm just telling you now like you're going to see this happen over and over.  If you don't actually know p a b.  There's a way to create it and if you look at this denominator, here's what it's doing. It's saying, okay your goal in life is to get B. Let's go get it. Here is one way I'm going to go get a first and then after a occurs, I'll get you B you didn't care about a but I got you be right.  So that's one way B could happen in life. Another way that be could happen is life is okay. I'm going to get you the compliment of a you didn't care about it. But here it is. And after I've got you the compliment of a I will didn't give you be.  So basically says if you want to be there only two ways you could ever be created in life.  And the way you can create it or based on what some other event is doing.  They've actually seen this idea before you cared about 3 or higher.  So how did we actually figure that out? Well 3 or higher and died a is what's going on up here into your higher and I be which was irrelevant to you, but it was all the ways to get 3 or higher right to set of partitioning up the totality of the ways. So this is known as advanced Bayes theorem. Now, it uses a big hot mess right of symbols, but it turns out you tend to have all those symbols when you do these kinds of problems.  So let's do a problem that uses a simple version.  Oh my goodness big block of text.  It's one of our things about that interpreting Big Blocks of text. So embrace it realize it's a scale in math. 183 30% of students got an A on some midterm.  Okay, 40% of students claim. They studied a long time or this was the definition of a long time for more hours.  The probability you got an A if you happen to have studied a long time.  His 70% this is why you study it increases your chance of getting an a right. What is the probability? You studied a long time if you got an A.  Oh, man.  So first, let's put some events down. Look at the major things that are being talked about in the problem.  And give them some letter so clearly whether you got an A or not is being discussed. So called it a day and studying a long time will be at us.  You don't need to Define events for their compliments. That is you didn't get in there cuz you can use the complement symbol. So try to minimize the number of events you too fine.  So what I'd like to do now is take all my colored underlines take my events and turn them into probability statements.  Good luck.  Decoding words. This is hard if English isn't your first language. I tried this in German. I would get destroyed like my second language 30% of students got no mention studying, right? So the marginal probability so you just repeat of a ecos .3. Okay. The red has no mention of the other idea getting an ass just about studying now the green getting complicated supposably do you got in a given that you studied a long time? So if I use the word given this is the most generous I can be  That's how you know, it's a conditional probability because the bar stands for the word given now it gets complicated cuz I can take away the word given I can put things so that the order around the word given is all wrong. You have to be very careful and just ask yourself. What do I actually know is true.  I know that the person study long time works for and whether they got an A and finally the yellow is with a problem wants there. So no number to put on there.  Okay, so here you can see this is a gentle problem in the sense that it's can use the simple Bayes theorem.  You have all of the marginals you need and the conditional probability. You need to go calculate the right hand side. So as given a is what we're worried about basal as a switching of the ordering and then you just go plugged in all the numbers. So apparently if someone got an A there's a very good chance. They studied a long time 90% almost try hard to get an A and not to have studied.  Is what this means the last problem here, so we're not going to have time for his about medical testing and this is where Bayes theorem is.  the most important  Hey, so I need you to try this problem at home try to working on your own before you look at the solutions.  And you'll learn a lot through this problem, but we should stop so you can have a good day.  UC San Diego podcast "
