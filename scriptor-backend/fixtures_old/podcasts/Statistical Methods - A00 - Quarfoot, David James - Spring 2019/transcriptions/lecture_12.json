    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  I didn't get much sleep last night 5 hours cuz I went to this amazing classical music concert in La Jolla last night. Go Shaham. The violence was playing my fourth time seeing them live couldn't sleep so exciting. So hopefully I'll be okay for you today.  the preamble  Okay, so we can start with a question. We'll see what you make of this.  Suddenly you have a job in the UCSD admissions committee. Congratulations big fancy job, right?  Two applicants cross your desk one got a 1775 on the SAT. The other got a 27 on the ACT.  That's all you know about them. Everything else has been blinded.  Which do you choose?  What are you guys wondering?  What do you wondering?  Ah-So  your noting that now it's out of 1600 clearly. That number is greater than hence. It must not be at the 1600.  One thing when you sit on admissions committees, you realize the test scores stay good for a very long time and people use old test scores all the time.  So there's the first observation. So now you know, how many points the SAT is out of 2400?  Does it matter?  That really what you wanted to know.  Turns out that's not really what you wanted to know.  Although it's a brilliant observation.  What do you really want to know?  How good the score is how do you decide how good the score is?  Compared to other people's what do you want to know about other people?  the mean  And the standard deviation you want both. That's a lot. That's a big ask. Maybe I'll give you both another reason. This is so frustrating is because these are a different unit system. And so when you said I want to know how good they are you wanted to reduce it to a common unit system or something that felt you know this so one way to do this is through something on the z-score. So what you do is you take your data value, which will call Y.  And we'll see how far it is from the mean. That's why bar you said you wanted to meet. There you go makes an appearance, right?  but it doesn't just matter with the mean is it also matters have spread out things are because lots of things have the same mean in life, but they're different amount to spread out is so if you divide by the standard deviation with salt uses SW here  What you're doing is your super saying we'll how far are you from the meeting your measuring a distance?  But that's still in the original units sat points act points by how many standard deviations above or below the mean you might be?  And if you just think about the units everything here is measured in a common units when you divide out you got a unitless idea.  So the z-score is one of the cleverest ideas to sort of take away the units on things and allow for comparison of apples and oranges. So I have to give you that information.  In this old system of sat scoring the average was 15. What's the standard deviation? And a lot of you probably don't know anything about the SAT where I come from in Texas. Everyone takes it so it's very common thing, but they are the average is 20.8 with an SD of 4.8. So, which would you take I'll give you one minute to figure this out so you can go fast.  Well, hopefully you did these two calculations at some point. You need a calculator or got to estimate something using fractions. So the ACT student was 1.3 standard deviations above the mean.  Wellesley sat was only one point one. So I may choose the person with the higher z-score. So this one way to think about z-scores is a ruler which is a way of measuring stuff, but it can measure anything in the universe.  And it works by sort of knocking out the original unit units on that thing. So it's a measure of extremity of a data point relative to its own data set. That's how you compare apples and oranges you understand the entire universe of apples and the entire universe of oranges and then you see how things are doing in the universe or how good they are to use your language, which is exactly what you were probably wondering why you'd why you even talking about this?  Where did this come from just came out of nowhere, right? We're talking about continuous random variables.  And the reason we talked about this is it provides a way to take any dataset and sort of we frame it in a way where the units have been removed, which is something we're going to need in a moment when we start talking about the normal distribution again. Okay, so if you took 5000 SAT scores  And you took actual data, you might get a mean of 1501.2 which is pretty close to what I said earlier and you might get a standard deviation is pretty close to what I said earlier.  Okay, and you can go drop picture of all these data in a histogram. So dump them in.  And here's what you get. Look how beautiful this is.  Look familiar shapewise.  Turns out it's a normal distribution like many things in life. Okay, so we can try to study things in this original setting where the x-axis is sat points.  Or what we could do and this is crazy. We could take every single data point in my data set that led to these statistics and I could take all those numbers in Z score them up just like you did with the SAT score in the last slide.  And now we would have 5,000 z-scores if we did that and if you wanted you can make histogram of those and you might say what's a second look like. Well, here's the picture on the right looks very similar to the picture on the left. Doesn't it? So when you z-score things all it does is just sort of shift him around and change their shape. But as long as you drop picture and have control over the axis, you can create a picture that looks identical except now it's centered is 0 suddenly.  That's interesting. And now the spread of this picture is actually one. That's the standard deviation. Okay, so I took everything I pump it through this formula and I got a new datapoint just like that.  And the dataset basically remains unchanged just the way you think about it say everyone in here has a height in inches, right or we could just think about all those in centimeters change the fundamental structure of y'all. Y'all are the same.  Just the way we're thinking about y'all. Now one thing you can tell from the picture immediately, which is one reason. I do this. Is it really a center 20 just walk.  The spread out in this is harder to see but maybe believe me. The new standard deviation is one.  So if you have a phenomenon with a certain spread and you shift it by its me now, it's a zero and if you / House part of it was a sort of him sit down to spread out and it's of one. Okay, so let's actually prove these claims so you don't have to just believe me. It's not just a collection of numbers. But let's say it's a random variable. So the Box near the button on it and tell someone's SAT score and that's how you get your 5,000 data points.  Okay, so every random variable comes with the mean and standard deviation.  So what you could do is you could take a random variable and imagine transforming it and creating a new random variable called Z.  Okay, so there's a new box. It was built around the old box and it has a button on it and you can hit a button. It'll spit out things. So supposedly this is supposed to spit out zero on average. Here's how you show that  You said what? What do I expect to come out of the box called Z?  Well, I can replace it with its formula x minus Mew over Sigma which is with the z-score formula does and then you can remember rules about expectation.  So for example, if there's a constant it can be pulled out front.  One of her Sigma got pulled out front.  And when you take the expectation of a random variable plus or minus a constant, which is what Miu is.  Then you can just take the expectation of the random variable and then just tack on the constant sister add activity property.  So then you just say what what is the expectation of the skin called X? Well we made a notation for its pop. Okay, we decided it should be mute so I can go take Mew and replace the effects with it.  sing believable  I like to think about it differently, which is intuitively if you have something it's something almond on it centered somewhere and it has some spread out of his wishes my arms. So if you subtract the center is just like moving me over this way, and I moved to zero.  Okay, let's see. If you can do this try to show that standard deviation is one give this a go.  So will you remember your facts about expectation standard deviation? Variance All That Jazz.  Okay, I'll have to do is follow the template. We just had.  Write take a standard deviation of 0 places to eat with its other name.  Okay standard deviation when their constant Six Sigma they can be pulled out front as long as you put an absolute value on them. But here the absolute value is not necessary for sigmas always positive. Okay, then the standard deviation of a variable plus or minus a constant things don't change how spread out they are when you shift them left right there still the same spread out, so you can just erase the constant minus Mew and then you just have to remember the standard deviation of X be defined as the symbol called Sigma. So that's how you get one. So now we have a tool to take any random variable or any data set and make it a unitless and in the process as we put everything through the z-score formula. Now everything is centered at 0 and standard deviation 1. This is called standardizing a variable. If you become a data scientist, it's something you do with almost all your variables cuz it wipes away the unit choices that were randomly decided by the person that collected the data set.  For another day you'll get there.  Okay. So now we have the ability to compare across data sets and we have the ability to standardize hennything. Those are the two takeaways so far.  Now let's use this in the standard normal setting for the normal setting. So here are three different phenomenon in life and all these phenomena happen to have normal distributions as we said at the end of last class. So they all follow bell curves.  The trouble is they're all in weird units. I'd look at it in terms of fish.  millimeters of mercury  he seemed so irreconcilable that it's hopeless, but maybe we could take all those different ways of thinking and convert them to a standard normal distribution. That is a normal distribution that must be Center to 0 and must have it spread out into someone.  And any question do you want to ask up here about SAT scores are blood pressure. Maybe we can convert it to an equivalent question down here on the bottom distribution the standard normal. So then always to do in life is understand the standard normal distribution. And if we have that in our belt or in our toolkit then any question up here is solvable and that's a brilliant idea. This is why you want to see score. It's so clever the first time you see this. Okay. So let's try a problem and I'll show you how this works cuz this is one of the most normally distributed things that exist and most people in the room have familiarity with it find the percentage of students that have an SAT score.  That is below 1800. So clearly were in the 2400 scale still. There's nothing to change it back to 2400 after we sit with 1600 for a while just like non-stop to keep doing some ice.  Okay. So the first thing you want to do is draw picture what's going on? So draw a normal distribution and the only reason he was a normal distribution is because I told you here.  Okay, now it's Center to 1500 with the standard deviation of 250 that we saw that earlier in class. So you draw nice bell curve you put 1500 down and then  The 250 is not easy to visualize in the picture. So you tend not to draw that in the picture. It's an amount. You have to go out sort of.  It's a spread idea.  Then we're going to put 1800 down cuz the problem cares about that and this is a probability question that uses the word percentage instead of probability. But those ideas are interchangeable cuz percentages are percents, which is one way thinking about probabilities and I shaded the left cuz we want the low.  Okay, now what's going on with this thing, this is the PDF  along, the horizontal axis are all the possible SAT scores you could get  so you could imagine this little blue curve like spitting out of value and it's sort of dropped one down and that's your score.  And we'd like to find the percentage that live below 1800.  Right now we're in the original units. And if you're in the original units, this is hard to solve. If you don't have technology your first choice could be to set up an integral isn't that how we always figure things out?  Remember how horrible the density function was at the end of last class?  So I'm guessing emotionally probably don't want to integrate that in fact.  The PDF for the normal distribution cannot be integrated.  In the sense that there is no antiderivative. You can dream up.  It's not possible. So you may have never seen this in 20 be but there are things that can't be integrated and what are called Elementary terms that is used nice gentle functions that we all know and love.  You can always approximate the area using rectangles and all sorts of other technology, but you can't think of an integer if it is and plug in the upper and lower bounds. So that's why technology so critical here. So I'm going to set up a random variable and you'll see me do this all the time again, I will encourage you to set up random variables. It gives you a notation to play with so here x is distributed as a normal random variable and you're a specified two parameters when you build one of these things tell me where it centered. That's Mew and tell me it's standard deviation your that's 250 later and some other classes. You won't put the standard deviation here. You'll put the variance. That's what I do in my 181b class. But here it's easier to think about standard deviation. So that's what we'll always put after the,  Now once I the letter X I can reframe the problem is just a probability in relation to X. So now I have notation to work with now that didn't help me solve it. It just mathematized everything. So if you want to solve it you can get out our  And you can type in your first big fancy function. So the P stands for probabilities, or I want to find an area under a curve Norm stands for normal.  First you tell us what's the exciting place that you're going to find area up to?  So that's 1800 in the problem. Then it needs to know which normal distribution you're on. So tell it it sent her to 1500 with a standard deviation of 250.  The last thing you need to tell it is which way it should shade or be thinking about should it go from 1800 down toward the lower tail?  Or should I go from 1800 up?  Or a way from the lower tail or toward the upper tail.  So this case lower tail gets true it away from me to say I love you to shade toward the lower tail. So we'll start here and was a shade left word and it will find that area. When is mr. Olympia decimal between 0 and 1 you can rethink it is a percentages if you want. Okay, but these are all the parameters you have to pass. Now, if your CS person you know that their things called default values for parameters. What if I don't specify anything like for example, if you don't specify which way to shade by default, it'll always shade left for the lower tail so you can omit that.  If you want, it just saves code coding time. It just means you have to memorize what are all the default values suited pushing information from the paper into your head is all that's going on.  Sorry, stop louder please.  The question is how do you know to use normal here? I have to tell you.  That's only what you know SAT scores might not be normal at all. I mean they are but they could be like five modal everyone does poorly or amazingly so you always have told in time you'll start to see things that will always be normal distributions and we'll talk about that many many things in life, especially biological things that have lots of variables that come in and influence them will turn out to be normal cuz there's something called the central limit theorem but a topic for another day. So anyhow, 88% of people will score below 1800.  Okay, that's good. I said to you probably got a percentile idea. This was telling me what percent of the area was to be lower than you you're in the 99 percentile you were better than 99% of people. Okay. So there's the first way to do this requires having our know most of you don't have are on the exam, right?  Your computer's not sitting there. So we need to think about other ways to do this. So another approaches to move to a standardized setting that is moved to the standard normal distribution.  That is a normal distribution that has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  So how do you move there? We'll all you do is you take a random variable X and you plug it through the z-score formula.  So I'm here. I'm making a new random variable called Z.  Okay now picked orally you can draw it exactly the same distribution except now the labels are different. So for example, it's not cold anymore. It's cozy not Center to 1500. It centered at 0 it doesn't have spread out in this 250. It has spread out in this one which you don't see in the picture.  Now the important thing is if you're going to reframe the question down here in the standard normal this number 1800, which is Central to the analysis needs to be converted to something. And the question is how does one do that? Will you just take the number 1800 and put it through the z-score formula to see where it lives on the standard normal distribution. So apparently get 1.2. So now when you frame the question the question is not about ex being less than 1800. It's actually in a b about Z being less than 1.2.  No one way to do this, if you don't want to answer all these pictures as you can come to this expression right here x less than 1800 and you can z-score both sides of that inequality to get x - 1500 / 250.  And you get 1800 - 1500 / 250.  and you know the expression to the left of the inequalities should be the letter z  and the thing to the right 1.2 is what exactly what we figured out before so some people will dispense with all the pictures and just use the algebra to help him. We frame the question on the standard normal.  I like both approaches. So we've moved from the X Universe to the Z universe and created an equivalent question.  Now you can go take this equivalent question into our  now you're just going from one point to and shading left your on a new distribution. The standard normal standard is 0 standard deviation 1 and you get the same answer like you should  now this may feel silly.  That's because it is you spend lots of time converting the original question to a new one and you could do the original one and are so you'll never actually do this.  But the previews what's going to happen next is the only reason we do it also for your fancy CS people the default value from mean and standard deviation of 0 and 1 so those could have been omitted from this big thing and again default value for which way you shake it to the left. So all this could have been omitted and you can type P Norm 1.2.  getting fancier  So good and you never going to do this?  Let me show you the last way and a lot of people will do this on the exam.  It's an exam. You're not going to have a computer if your calculator can do a bunch of fancy stuff that mimics what we just did in our you can use that but if you don't have a fancy calculator you're going to use the following approach. So you need to standardize and then you need to use what are called tables standard normal tables. Okay, so you imagine the original problem moving it over and now the problem is about the number 1.2 and you just need to find how much area is to the left.  So what we doing this case is we answer the question using a table.  And it's a table only for the standard normal. See they can't print a table for every possible normal distribution ever.  There be infinitely many tables cuz there's every possible centering place for the me and every possible standard deviation. This would require infinitely many pages that would take up the entire universe unless the universe is infinite in a more Infinity than the number of pages. I don't know how big the Infinity of the universe has anyhow, so what you do is you take your number that you care about 1.2 and you rounded to two decimal places, which sometimes means adding a zero like here and then we're going to break this number into the final digit which is in the second place and everything else.  And you going to take those two things and you're going to look them up in a table? Okay. So this is what a z table looks like we will use be in this class always to mean the standard normal. The King Center is your with red one.  Now down the side here. You can see a bunch of things that look like the first two digits.  Like we just saw a right here and across the top. You can see things that look like they're just studying the second decimal place. So what you'll do if you'll take the 1.2 and find that row.  And then you take the second decimal place and you'll find that column is a 1.20.  And at the intersection of those you will find a number. What does that number mean? Well now you have to look at the picture.  The picture is saying if you give me your number, I find area to the left of your number.  That's exactly what we wanted in this problem. So the intersection is our answer. So here's the answer. We got before .88 for 9, right?  Okay, so every number inside the table Central to it is an area or probability and all the numbers along the edges.  Are Z scores or values along the horizontal axis that you've decomposed?  And they just come up with a clever way to arrange this.  So these tables are all I'm trying that if you want to start practicing with them. They're also the back of your book, which is where I got them.  Okay, got the same answer great.  So these are the three ways to do a problem.  I would recommend Option 1 or option 3 but not option to because it's inefficient.  Let's see how you do.  Hey, there's another problem that uses the normal distribution. I love this first time ever saw. This problem was like 5 years ago, and I said that sexy.  I'm obsessed with mathematical problems that took the focus my research. Is that how do you write better and sexier problems? Anyhow, apparently it centered at 55 in with a standard deviation of 6 what percentage of 10 year olds can ride Disneyland Space Mountain?  Which has a height requirement of 44 in?  If you don't have the tables in front of you right now, you can go on your phone go to Triton Ed and click on these tables and start using them. You could also load up the e-version of the book onto your phone. So it will take two or three minutes here and see how you do.  If you force yourself to draw a picture of what's going on and Define random variables, you will get many more problems, correct?  So one thing after realizes a height requirement for rides means you have to be at least that tall.  If you're taller than that number you can ride the ride if you're not.  Then you can't ride the ride. So that's why she headed to the right. It took a real world interpretation of what a height requirement for a ride means  Okay notice. I'm putting 55 and 44 down on this axis. I don't put the standard deviation because it's hard to visualize that in this picture.  Okay. Now we need to find this area. I defined X is a random variable. It's modeled by a normal distribution. It represents the height of a random.  Person who shows up to Disneyland, that's what it stands for and the possible values are along the horizontal axis here. Like they always are so our goal is to get X to be greater than or equal to 44 in a few that had are in front of you could immediately find the answer 96.6  So most people can ride this ride.  Who are 10 years old?  So how do you do this? If you don't have that? Well, you would have to use a table convert the problem and you notice something interesting about this problem. The area goes to the right not to laugh.  Oh my goodness. This is frustrating right because the table is normally set up to go the other way. So let me show you how you do this with the table.  so first you have to get yourself so you can use a table which means you need to move to the standardized setting so pump everything in the problem through the z-score formula in particular pump the number 44 now if you draw on a picture  You know, you're supposed to get a negative z-score. The reason is this datum is below the mean you have to go negative standard deviations to get to it. So look and see a lot of years calculation.  Do you have a negative number in on your page Sophie of the picture then you trust that emotionally. Okay. So now if you want to show it algebraically you could do it this way by dividing both sides of the inequalities by the appropriate amount after subtracting the meeting and look at the same thing that we just got right there.  Okay. Now here's the typical setup, right? It's shaded area to the left.  So if you want to think in the area that shading to the right you have to use the following idea under any density function normal exponential whatever the area is 1  so if you subtract from one elect shading idea you get it right shading idea.  Now we can look up this idea right here probability Z less than -1.8 and a table because tables are built the shade left.  So now you get yourself to a table now that number -1.83 we need to split up into the -1.8 the first two things and then finally the second decimal place.  And the intersection of those is the area to the left of -1.83.  That number we need to go subtract from one. So remember what's going on.  So the cool thing about technology, is it easily Shades left or right?  The frustrating thing is about tables. It doesn't require as much power right you have to have a computer in front of you is cheap to print out one page of paper, but it doesn't have the ability to instantly work in any setting so you're going to have to work hard to twist.  The table into the tool that you want, that's all and it just requires these sorts of tricks.  So if I were you I would practice both.  On the homework so that you feel really good and understanding how to use technology and using tables. So when the exam comes around you practiced in an authentic way in which you might be experiencing if you plan on using your calculator during the exams and go learn how to use your calculator to find these areas. You don't have P Norm on your calculator be your something similar. So I'm trying and you can find a document that lists how to do a lot of things with your calculator. If you have a standard calculator if you have some weird brand good luck Google. It'll tell you what to do. You don't need me.  Okay. Now another issue is  rounding stuff  So this comes up all the time.  So the people who are using tables are forced to round to two decimal places on their Z scores.  Because that's how the tables set up right and then they got an answer that always has four decimal places gay people using technology. There's all these rounding things and they can get things spitting out to nine decimal places or whatever. Okay people worry all the time about rounding.  I don't get worked up over this. Okay, you're asking about a step that really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things things to three decimal places and there might be rounding steps in the middle that some people have to do when other people don't okay. So answers may come out slightly different in the end. There are so many issues that are baked into doing a problem. Like this are the height of 10 year olds perfectly normally distributed, probably not. So we've already built an assumption into this whole problem that has some dirty Miss. So now you're worried about other kinds of dirtiness that appear so stop worrying about that kind of dirtiness.  Just give me the answer near the correct thing and don't do anything in truly silly in the middle.  Okay, don't round the number 1.83 that shows up here to 2:30. Silly. They tell me something you would lose points for.  Okay.  Try another one.  So funny we started talking about sleep at the beginning and then we come right back to it. It's Central to life.  Let's see how you do on this.  So turns out how long people sleep every night Michigan hours for men on a weekday. Cuz weekends are hot mess right is a normal distribution at 6.9 the average American male sleep 6.9 hours per night. Are you above average or below?  Standard deviation 1.5. There's some real spread out nursing what's going on with American men, whatever that term means what percentage of American men are within one standard deviation of the mean.  Good luck.  This should take 2 minutes if you're on fire in a wake.  She might be on those low end of the normal distribution.  Or you might not identify as male.  So if you stayed in the original setting hopefully drew me a picture. No picture. No picture no picture.  picture  one out of four, that's not very good.  Okay.  So then you probably went up and down the standard deviation. You know, how big is standard deviation is don't you? It tells you the problem. So if the standard deviation of 1.59  and subtract it and you get some new numbers and then you could trade me a little area. Did you send up a random variable? Let X be this normal distribution. Now, you have a notation that you can use in the following statement. We want to find the probability X lives between two bounds.  Okay. Now you can solve the problem they're using technology or you could realize that solving this problem.  With the table will require you thinking about shaving leftward. So you reimagine this area right here as a big honkin area - a little hunk an area that you don't care about  and that's how you create the shape right here.  And both of these are look up a bowl and tables especially if you go and convert to a standard normal now if you want to use are you can just do two P Norms he give me all the area up through a point for that includes area. I don't care about and then subtract area that goes through 5.4 that they read like to remove from the answer.  So 68 ish is what you got or something near go ahead.  The question is on Ted. There's a negative z-score table and a positive one. It takes two pages to fully do the table the exam will give you both if you need both. It's possible to understand because of symmetry.  That you only need part of what's really going on in some settings. Okay, so I'll give you what you need or I'll give you things that can help you figure out what you need.  That's a great question. Okay. So 68% of people are within one standard deviation is basically what we figured out in this problem. Now, what school is this answer doesn't depend on the fact that we were on the Sleep distribution at all if you take any  Normal distribution and you stand at the center and you go out one standard deviation. However much that is  You will always go grab 68% of the area roughly. So this is known as the 68 95 99.7 rule for any normally distributed data set a big hunk and set of it is within one standard deviation 68% 95% of all the data are within 2 standard deviations. So this is the blue and the green here and if you're willing to go out three standard deviations, you will capture almost everyone on the planet 99.7% of people. This is true regardless  Of the particular normal distribution you're on.  Just kind of interesting. Okay, and you can go check these calculations. If you move to a standard i setting if you're one standard deviation above when you go calculator z-score you get one cuz that's what is the score measures how many standard deviations are above? So this guy right here will make you believe when I'm claiming.  And the same thing for 2 and 4 3. This is just a really helpful way to think about things.  And what it can do.  I told 2 minutes. I want some I'm taking them. You know, I'm going to take them.  2 minutes * 30 classes equals 60 minutes equals additional class  Yes, give me what this allows you to do with quickly. Just think about some rough things in life.  So you can have a an idea very quickly. So here's an example. Okay Harvard to get into Harvard. This is the mean SAT score.  20 to 50 in the old system what percentage of students will actually hit that level or higher.  NBA average Harvard material basically, okay. So if you take additional distribution 1500 250 which will notice as if this number 2250 just happens to be exactly 3 standard deviations above.  So this allows us a quick way to figure out what percentage of students meet that mean Harvard SAT score. Okay, so we effectively want to find the area on this little rat tail.  What is the percentage of people who take the SAT that will make the Harvard mean cut off now, you know within three standard deviations the purple pink red if that's 99.7. So if you subtract that from a hundred you get the total left tail, it's like tiny little left tail and you get the tiny right tail Beyond 3 standard deviation and then you can just go divide that by two and you can see only .15% of people even get an SAT score with it is the average Harvard SAT score. So it shows you just how special of the school is in terms of SAT scores.  My 2 minutes are up. Thank you for giving them to me. Have a great weekend.  Is it podcast. Ucf.edu? "
