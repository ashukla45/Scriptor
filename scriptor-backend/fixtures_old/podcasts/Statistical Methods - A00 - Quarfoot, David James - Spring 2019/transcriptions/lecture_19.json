    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Hope you had a nice weekend as you can probably tell him quite sick.  disastrously sack you might say  but I'm here for you cuz there's so many beautiful things to learn.  I can't stop that.  You probably saw in your email by now that exam 2 grades have been released.  You can take your number of points in / 20.  To figure out what your percentage is.  Double account for the fact there was a bonus problem and it gives us like curve.  The median grade after doing so is about an 80%  So you have some sense of how people are doing in the class. So that's pretty good. That was a very long and difficult exam. So I was really proud to see people do that. Well,  Should we move forward with the truth?  Let me tell you something truthfully.  No, it's not about exams course. That's what you that the truth is going to be about. It's actually about what we've been doing all along. There's been a little lie going on.  And you with all been participating in it. So let's clean up that lie today. It's going to be very exciting. So we're going to spend most of the rest of the class in this big charge here.  So we're going to divide are like between focusing on the meat and focusing on a proportion almost everything you care about in life is one of those two things believe it or not.  okay, now once you're in one of those we're going to work on the same thing from one population or from to  this class will focus on some harder things like focusing on three or four or k populations will do something cool to know before that.  Okay. So here we are. We're going to learn how to do hypothesis testing and do confidence intervals for one population. When what you care about in life is the mean  I know what you're probably saying is have already done this.  What we have but we just didn't tell you the truth. Okay, so what we used to do.  When we're up here is weed say you care about X bar. That's the average and it has this distribution.  Xbox wants to give you the truth from you, but there's some variability in what can happen. That was the signal over the square root of n?  And I label this is a normal distribution.  Well in some cases it is in a perfect idealize world, but the truth is if we're going to wash away all the lies from your soul.  Is it the normal distribution? It's an exactly what's going on there?  I'm so anytime. You have a small population.  Or if you're dealing from some population that isn't perfectly normal to start with.  Their interviews in the normal distribution. There's a better option that squeezes out a little more accuracy and all the calculations. The reason we haven't done it so far. Is it to big hot mess?  And there was so much going on already that I didn't want to overwhelm you.  And this tends to be the best way to introduce this believe it or not. It's a lie to people for a while and then come back and clean it up when they're ready to hear the truth.  All sorts of metaphors. I'll skip using right there about how we do this in real life all the time. Okay. So let me show you two distributions. This red dotted thing is a beautiful normal distribution. It's a standard normal impact centered at 0 spread 1 and what I've done here in solid is something called a t distribution.  Which you'll notice looks a lot like the normal distribution.  The only difference is it tends to put more weight into the Tails. So if you look way to the left and right the graphs a little higher.  And it tends not to put as much of its weight in life behind the central values near zero.  Now unfortunately, the reason I just didn't give you the t-distribution earlier. It is not just one curve if it were just one car people can handle it, but it's actually a whole family of Curves.  So this is just one of the possible T distributions here and blue. There's infinitely many. In fact, oh my goodness. No one thing I'll notices if you start shading areas and Tails, which is how we find P values.  When you shade an area under the blue curve, it's going to have a little more than the red curve. Does CRP Valley will be a little bigger.  I'm bigger P values tend to keep you with the null hypothesis.  That is this a more conservative tool it wants to keep you away from the alternative just a little more than the normal distribution does.  Okay, so instantly the question everyone has is.  Now that you're telling us the truth, what do we do in life? Will the answer is you'll never use the normal distribution again?  When it comes to dealing with me.  Later, when we get the proportions, we will use the normal distribution and it will be the truth approximately.  Okay, so from now on everyone's going to use tea for the rest of this course.  So here we go. Now there's a reason that we have this other distribution and we'll look at it in a moment, but let's start thinking about  what the t-distribution family looks like  Okay, so here's a picture of a lot of different T distributions.  30 distributions are always centered at 0 for us that is so they always come in there standardized form where they've been relocated and given the appropriate spread out in this.  In order to figure out what career on I need something that indexes and tells me so this is known as the degree of Freedom parameter DF here.  And it basically says which of the curves are you on?  Now the name degree of Freedom suggest you that something sexy must be going on under the hood that this is not just some indexing parameter that tells you a curve you're on it also says something else in life more on that in a moment also.  tell me how you can think about this not just as a  indexing parameter that tells you your curve, but you'll notice as we get deeper and deeper to the degree of Freedom number as it gets bigger.  The t-distribution slowly morph into the standard normal, which is the darkest curve here.  So these curves are all working their way toward being the normal so you could think about the standard normal is an idealized world where everything is rainbows and butterflies the normal pulse, but I want to use but sadly this is a horrible world full of darkness and despair. I've been watching a lot of black mirrors you can tell  and the T distribution is the tool that will help you survive in this dark black mirror world.  My parents are finally getting Netflix streaming. That's what my mom told me this weekend when I called her for Mother's Day.  And I said, oh my goodness now that you have a streaming version instead of the disc in the male version. There's so many things you can watch now like Great British baking show and Black Mirror.  She watched the first episode it was really hard on her soul. So anyhow.  There's this tool that striving toward rainbows and butterflies and working its way there at the degree of Freedom goes to Infinity.  Now what which curve should you work on in life? That's the next question whenever you're doing some sort study. Well if your data set has ended a points in it.  Then it turns out the degree of Freedom parameter in a curve you should live on is and -1 now. I can't prove this to you right now. I can't even convince you and some really meaningful way.  If you take 181a, this is the first time you see the reasoning for this and it's super complicated and it happens in the middle of some horrible six-page proof of linear algebra. So that's what's really going on and I can give you an intuition in a moment and I will but you'll probably like a lot more now, you might wonder where do all this nonsense come from. And this is one of the fun stories and statistics. So William Gossett is a famous statistician and he's working at Guinness Brewery the beer.  It's like sludge, right?  And he's doing all these experiments of Guinness and he's taking all sorts of averages.  But something was always just a little off from what should be going on and is wondering why things are off and one day. He says I'm doing all of my analysis on this normal distribution this rainbows and butterflies, but that's not true.  And he discovered that a more precise tool to use was this thing called the T distribution and he dreamt this up.  Now he couldn't publish his work because he was bound by the restrictions of Guinness Brewery and they have all these closets to keep their trade secrets. So how beer companies are and they said you can publish the results as long as it's under some pseudonym.  And so he chose the name student.  Strangely, so when he published his first article about this thing called the T distribution and its value to give more precise results.  It originally got the name students T because of his pseudonym. Now, some people will be faithful to who he is and call it. It's t distribution. But anyway, he was able to just squeeze a little more accuracy out of everything by being faithful to the reality of the world instead of living in the unicorns and rainbows of the standard normal, which is just a little off. Okay. So let's try to work with our beautiful new Black Mirror world  Here's a question. How much area is to the right of negative .6 on some random T distribution?  Okay, so let's start here. So what are you do you draw something that looks like a bell curve. It'll look just like you drawing a standard normal. Okay. It's very hard to separate exactly the shape of this if there's nothing to compare to and then he popped on point six and you shade to the right.  Now two ways to find the area first is to know the density function for the T distribution, which is horrible. Not even my 181a students are forced to memorize it only in graduate school do start to memorize it. I mean really horrible.  Okay. Now we're probably going to do that. And even if I told you you couldn't find areas under it cuz it's too hard in a great but what you could do is go to the computer and use the standard things. We used to help us. So by now you're getting used to the d p q r quartet of functions these help you work with any distribution. So the P helps you find areas or probabilities under this. So tell it what place you'd like.  Tell it which curvier on through the degree of Freedom parameter until it whether you want to shade toward the lower tail or toward the upper tail. So here lower Tara gets false. So there's .70 9 so there's some area and really we can only do this with technology.  So on the exam I'll have to give you some table if I ever want you to use the T distribution for anything.  Okay, so we have PT now.  QT all the other things you can Generate random values from a t distribution if you want all those Herrera operation using RT.  Okay. Here's another question.  So what percent?  Of the distribution related to tea with six degrees of freedom is more than two units away from zero.  So you'd start this the same way you draw me some picture. It looks like some random bell curve.  You put down -2 + positive 2 and shade to the extremes cuz the way the problem is worded.  Then you say I'm never going to find out myself by hand.  I'm just going to go to my technology for you. Maybe to calculator. Maybe it's our.  You could see how hard this was gossip discovered this in 1908.  There was no are there was no computer.  So people just have to somehow figure out tables of these things by doing horrible approximation. Anyhow, we could double the area to the left of negative 2 that'll give us .09.  Okay, so we're just like pushing things around and learning to use our new tools are right and one thing that's interesting is you can compare what's going on with the normal. You know, how much area is outside of two standard deviations?  There's 95% inside. So this 5% outside. So this curve has fatter tails. The tails are a little higher.  Ed wants to make more area out in the extremes and give you bigger P values if you're using it, so it's making you more conservative in life.  Okay. Now one thing it's frustrating about the T distribution. It is definitely centered at 0 it comes in its standardized form normal distributions. As you know can sort of be wherever they want centralized and be spread out as much as they want.  So if you ever need is a t-distribution to do anything you have to resend to your data, you have to put it in a standardized form as you bring it to the T distribution.  So you can't stay in the original setting of the problem, unfortunately.  Oh, that's frustrating. That's okay. We can standardize things. We know how to do that in Life or subtract means / standard deviations.  Okay. Now this is the first example of a family of distributions that's going to be painful to create tables for.  The reason is there too many degrees of freedom.  Okay. So first of all, if you can leave the table like we are are you horizontally? You have to tell me that and I'll help you figure out area ideas. So already there's six or two things that could very  But there's also which curve you're on.  So that is a new element to play with.  So the first option is to make a table for every single T distribution.  That would be infinitely many tables.  Are there enough atoms in the universe?  Is the universe finite Lee many atoms?  Yes, you say confidently how do you know the universe is finally many atoms.  Low confidence, but you read it somewhere.  sadly most things written or false  So that's not a good reason to believe anything in life. 50% of all medical knowledge has changed every 10 or 15 years something like that.  You probably saw some like 10 to the 24th or some stupid like thing like that, right? I don't know how many things are in the universe. Don't ask me. I'm not a physicist.  But anyway, so here's how these tables are really going to work because we can't print infinitely many tables one for each of the possible T distributions. Something's Gotta Give.  And here's what's going to give so first thing we're going to do is down the side you pick which t-distribution you want to be on.  Okay, then if you look at the numbers here  These numbers inside are places along the horizontal axis. That is different.  Then a standard normal distribution.  Now if you care about the number two, for example, I can that last problem. We want to find the area Beyond two standard deviations or just the value to  that's between 1.94 and 2.45 is the number two doesn't even show up on the table.  Okay. Now if you go up to the top and you say I care about both Tails right now, it's telling you that the area in both Tales combined is somewhere between .05 and point one.  So notice her answer is not precise. It's not exact its bounds on what the area is and that's what had to give.  We couldn't be very precise were just too many things unless we print Infinity tables. I'm fine. Technology will give you points 092 if you feel like you need something precise in life, but if you ever need is a t t table realize you just get bounced on your answer in this actually, okay?  Can you really care if the area is 2.092 or .08?  You're probably comparing it to .05 so doesn't really matter its exact value in the current setting.  Okay. So what's weird about this is the areas are up here on the top and the values on the horizontal axis or in the middle of the table, which is swapped from a standard table.  Okay. So now that we have this tool now, we have a new formula for confidence intervals. The only thing that changes is the letter Z is going to be changed to a T.  We're still going to take our best guess whenever we have an average that's known as X bar comes from the data.  And then we're going to Pat it.  fine amount  so that the center Bowl  has a pretty good chance of capturing the true thing we care about now here you see me rating T * 7 - 1 it reminds us that the correct color we need to do the analysis on this a t distribution with n -1 degrees of freedom.  NXT star is the place that if you put it down and put its mirror location for the negative version the amount of area here is whatever you want your confidence level to be so it has 95% then it's figuring out between what bounds you can capture that much area.  Now, let me give you the emotion for why there's an in minus one there.  We're trying to get into the average of some population. Maybe it's how much money kids get from the tooth fairy.  Do you know there is some value?  If you could call up the universe it would tell you what the value was now, I can't call it the Universe. I don't have that that phone number.  Okay, so you list Ender you're going to collect right and you go to the university can give me and start getting data.  Now that you're getting the data they can be whatever they want. Right first spot. Okay. That's my mom giving me money next Bob that you you got some money.  Okay, and we have all this freedom and what the data can be?  That was me getting really close to the end.  We've done and minus one of our end data points. They could all be whatever they want. The last data point can't actually be whatever it wants to be in life.  because it hamstrung by the fact that it needs to make the overall average come out to be somewhat reasonable and make this dataset harmonize with the universe is that  This is the emotional reason why is 10 - 1.  Okay, so when it comes to data they have freedom to do whatever they want. Except the last one.  West has to ensure  the harmonious nature and make everything come out to be right for the global average, which is hidden from us.  So that's one way.  Okay. Anyhow.  Is SMU calculation? Here's another cool thing. This used to be Sigma over the square root of n but that was a green Universe, right? And what did we do on the very first problem?  We merely said I we don't know that we'll never know that list of puss SMX in standard deviation from our sample.  Okay, so turns out if you would take 181a and learn why everything is true in life around statistics. It's this moment right here the replacement of the true standard deviation.  With what you got in your sample, that is what's a routing things and moving you from a normal distribution to a t distribution.  So if you ever really knew this was Sigma and you knew that value somehow and you knew your data perfectly came from a normal distribution and use the normal distribution has been using for the last few weeks to describe that far, but it's such a dream world as it never happens.  So anyhow, it's really this step the crease the t-distribution.  So let's try one. You'll see this really isn't that bad. How much do us baby girls weigh?  You see that article. Everyone's naming their kids after Game of Thrones now.  When should you name your baby girl Arya Stark if you could  That's all you people that saw some of the recent episodes know what I'm talking about.  greatest moment in TV history  So the only way you would ever know this is two-way all baby girls in the US ever. Now. This is super complicated. Some people aren't going to let you weigh their baby.  Okay, it also assumes some sort of gender binary and that you can decide on what someone's gender is by looking at them when they're born. I don't know that's complicated to  Anywho instead of trying to ask Infinity people what's going on, you just break into 12 random hospitals and put some babies on scales and then run away seems like a great plan now in your potato side you get an average of 7.3.  Wilson vs. Pounds in America  But there was some spread out and is currently not all babies weigh the same when they're born. So let's go try to build a 90% confidence interval. So everything's going to feel the same. The only difference is our answer is more faithful now.  So what's really going on?  Okay. So first I'm going to decide what it is. We want to study here and I'm going to figure out what model we need to be on to study that so there's now this extra stuff so we only have 12 date appointments.  That is a pretty small sample size. So the T distribution is actually quite valuable and this kind of setting it's very honest to what's going on. And when William Gossett was doing all sorts of stuff with beer. He had small sample sizes for 5 batches or something he'd make and then measure something about them.  Okay. So anyhow, we want to be Auntie 7 - 147 11.  connection one draw a picture the goal is to get 90% of the area Central to this picture and figure out what place on the horizontal axis does this  Okay. Now that's going to force .05 in each tail.  So if you want to one way to figure this out is to plow your way through 95% of the area 5% You don't care about 90% you do and you get to this value 1.79.  which is with t star is  Hey Sis, one approach.  Such a mess.  Are you table people?  Luckily, I gave you a value. That was really nice. Love the table at the top only a certain values The Raven possible. So hopefully give you one of those. Okay. So in this problem, I'd like 10% of the area to be in the Tails leaving 90% in the middle. I also know where Auntie 11 so I can look at the intersection of those. It tells me the place on the horizontal axis 1.80 which is what the computer gives us. Also all rounds, right? So that's how you find T star.  The last thing we have to do is just break out the formula use it and interpret our results.  Okay. So now the formula is X bar or best guess plus or minus some garbage.  The garbage is well something about what curve you need to be on and the spread out in this of that universe that you're studying.  Okay. Now the standard error formula is always Sigma over the square root of an  always given up on Sigma. So we'll just say the standard deviation divided by the square root of hand. So too was in the problem and this has 12 data points in it. So it's weird is the formula has both an n and a 10-1 in it. The end is here underneath the square root in the end minus one gets encoded into this t-star value. So can get quite confusing for people.  So just embrace the endless and the end - 1 - of everything.  Okay, so now you some interval. So now I have to write something for all the people out there that don't know any statistics. Hopefully we can write something that isn't too confusing.  Good luck on that.  Here's what your book likes you right or 90% confidence that.  The true parameter trying to study is in our interval.  Okay, so the claim is about the true parameter if you can measure all babies, good luck.  rural, Alaska is hard to get to  90% confident means our interval came from a process that builds intervals and tries to make most of them good in life, but 10% will be bad and not actually have the true thing in them. I don't know if our interval is a good one or a bad one, but I'll just put it out there and while I hope it's good.  Who knows?  Okay. Now if you want to know the truth.  We actually do measure all babies in the US basically all the ones that goes to hospitals at least.  I wonder if you're at home babies differ somehow if you're going to have your baby at home and not go to the hospital.  Do you think you're different somehow? You say no good. That's the answer. I wanted. I don't know if it's true, but  That's how life works. We just believe whatever you want. Right? Look for someone to say the thing. You're hoping in your soul confirmation bias over and over.  It's called MSNBC and Fox News and CNN. That's all they are anymore today.  Let's do some Socrative.  Everyone likes their cell phones  Except me.  I hate cell phones you're doing inference.  Sampling distribution should be modeled by.  Well, I'm glad people are choosing a obviously the correct answer.  A lot of people are choosing be maybe because they heard this in AP Stat in high school or because they thought the answer should be complicated.  I don't know but the truth is you don't really need this to be complicated at all. You can always use T 7-1.  Done. Okay. We know we learned earlier that the t-distribution slowly morphs into the standard normal and it does that is the degree of Freedom gets paid that is as the population gets big. So trying to make a distinction about switching over to the standard normal.  2 or the normal distribution for large samples is silly because the distribution is turning into it.  Now there are few people in the world that do use the normal distribution in certain rare cases.  But it's like a one out of a million kind of event and they're trying to squeeze a little extra that they can out of what's going on by doing that but I think it's for the rest of us in the world that aren't the one out of a million. It's much easier to think about using the T distribution always.  Building a 80% CI for some average.  What is the critical value?  If you have a sample of size 15.  Okay, so 80% sample size 15. So first I go to n minus 1 that's 14 next 80% at least 20% combined in the two tails. So I just look at the intersection of those two ideas. That's how you get 1.35.  I noticed like look Houston small the differences are between these things. Right like some people use this 15 cuz I forgot the in mind as 11.3 for any differences and trying to squeeze out the last bit of juice. We can from the lemon here by using these more precise distributions and getting everything really, correct.  What commands in our would give you the previous answer?  Select all that are correct.  That didn't go so well did it.  You see why the question is still on the slides?  Oh my goodness.  You got to draw the visualization in your head.  Or on the board if you have a board.  We care about the Central Area being point eight.  That leaves point to in both tails you can divide it is .1 in the left and point one in the right.  We care about this place right here.  This is Tri Star show one way to get to it is to plow through are you don't care about and are you do care about and have the computer spit out that place? That's why it's .9 you got to go through area you don't care about.  Okay, what sea sea is plowing through this area right here.  On the left and spitting out this value, which if you put a negative sign in front of will turn into the positive version.  She is a stupid calculation that you never do give me how unnatural it is, but it's still a correct answer.  What's the below thing approximately equal?  Okay, you probably saw this as the degree of Freedom goes to Infinity.  50 distribution turns into the standard normal. So thousand is really huge for degree of Freedom. So this is basically like doing things on P, Norm.  You're saying find all the area after 1 subtract the area to negative on that gives you a central area.  And we know that they're 68% of the area within one standard deviation.  About how much area is to the left of negative to Auntie 15?  Okay, so you see we only abounds on this answer. So first thing is to the left of -2 the same as to the right a positive 2.  So then you come over here to the table and you take row 15 and you find the number to which is between 1.75 and 2.13.  And then you go up to the top and you say I just want one tail.  And it gives you an area between .025 and .05.  Turn the exam people with fancy technology can find the exact area and people tables will give me bounce on the area and the problem will allow either is totally fine.  Suppose you want to do inference on some average and weenies a t distribution?  When does the T distribution actually model?  the sampling distribution for X bar  This is going to be super curious.  OAS so tempting, isn't it?  I sold this teachers tribution is this beautiful tool of the reality of the universe turns out it's not actually a good model. If you do have a garbage dataset show all the conditions we used to have for using the normal distribution are the same conditions you need for the T distribution is just a more honest reflection of what's really going on.  If you said the problem up so that you have good things in life. So we're still going to need our independence which will get to randomization and 10% condition.  And we still need the population. We're starting with the be nice.  But it's okay. If it's not nice as long as the sample size is large enough.  Are you okay with larger end?  So those are the conditions for using this tool and instruct a little better than a normal distribution.  Maybe we should do hypothesis testing problem.  Using our new infrastructure and see what that feels like.  I love this question.  That's always a fun one.  It turns out back in 2000 if you looked at the Boston Marathon.  every single person the whole population  on average people ran the marathon and 3.683 hours.  You're curious if people are getting faster or slower.  First thing can you argue both sides? So I love someone to argue?  Why Runners are either getting faster in the current year 2018 or slower? You don't have to believe what you're saying. It just has to be reasonable.  They're better and lighter shoes and people are getting faster.  That's what you say.  Sounds believable someone argue the opposite opinion.  people care less about the Boston Marathon  hensu tracks less Talent  and it sucks now.  believable, right  No, she don't do that. Don't make it a binary. Don't be like seconds wrong, but I guess right.  Everybody is both wrong and right it's the amount of evidence. It's the Seesaw that you care about.  I'm just looking here in general. I'm not looking at you that be a binary decision.  Emoting at the space in the room.  There's no judgement for me a long time ago too exhausting. I'm too old for that kind of nonsense.  Okay. Hey plenty of sports things go out of style.  And like no one cares about that event anymore and other ones rise to prominence. So it definitely believable except I happen to live in the Boston area during the year of the bombing that got a lot more interest to know if you're not wrong or right who knows training all this stuff is why ruins to be getting faster, right?  I heard a cool one. I love this argument for why people are getting slower.  To make more money the organizing committee lesson more people.  All the good people that were already running it. So if you let him or yours is dipping down.  And call those slower people.  Who knows maybe they'll cancel each other out and everybody's a winner all your logic to write felt the store doing things to find a variable.  This is the parameter if you could measure everybody in the current year, and maybe it hasn't happened yet in the current year. So it's a future event.  for example  So you set it up and then when the event comes around you go collect some data, so it would be really boring if the current year would just the same because then no one would win in the room and you want to know who's going to win, right?  Binaries that's all sports are who wins and who loses toward people in the bins.  He rotated about a two-sided alternative because we had beautiful arguments on both sides.  Okay. So now you need some data should be about the current year cuz that's what your population parameters about. So you go take 20 random people because you don't have time to look up everybody who wants to do that you get an average of 3.8.  Did you instantly look and compare it?  Okay, but there's some spread out Miss run a hypothesis test with off of equals .05.  so  here's a picture of what's going on if you think about our original setting  or finding an average right at 20 people.  Now if it's not is really true or expecting things around 3.683.  But we recognize there's variability.  And we got three point eight.  Now we would have been excited about high things or low things because I love all of the logic that just came out right so I'm sitting both directions. So I created the symmetrical place.  Not if we're going to do this with the T distribution, we're supposed to be in a t distribution with 19 degrees of freedom and -1.  But I told you earlier the T distribution Zar always centered at 0 they've already been standardized.  So what we need to do if we're really going to call this a teacher tribution is moved to the standard i setting  Okay, sure. You always do this and these problems.  When it came to using the normal distribution, you didn't always have to do this because you could stay in the original setting cuz there were tools and tables and things that would help you basically.  Now the question is how do you move to this standardized setting?  What we're going to do what you always do we're going to push things through a z-score formula or standardization formula. If you don't like me using Z you anymore cuz we're not on the normal distribution.  So you take your best guess of what's going on 3.8?  You subtract the center of this distribution, which turns out to be the value that appeared in the null hypothesis.  80 / how spread out this beautiful curve is here.  which is the standard deviation of the square root of an to see me doing that here .5 was given in the problem divided by the square root of n  So all it does is create a new value, but that value lives on the curve. I say it does this T distribution with 19 degrees of freedom. Some people call this a z-score is Easter.  It's just a tool that helps you in immediately get you so I would recommend not drawing the picture on the left.  underline the picture on the right and just moving yourself to the cleanest Universe you can  now this is an area problem. You're either going to look it up on a table or you going to do this in our something like that.  I feel like are you can just double the area for either of the halves at UC point three?  This result was among the 30% strangest things. We could have gotten.  That's not very strange. I want out of three event.  flip a three-sided coin  something came up. Are you excited in life you throwing out your belief system roll a die one or two came up. Are you amazed in life? Probably not.  So but didn't meet our 5% cutoff for strange things.  How will people know it seems like people are kind of the same your Logix.  averaged out  peritraumatic my goodness. Nothing's changed in the Boston Marathon. Despite all the Talking Heads.  Porsche great ideas  does Nunavut really true?  I love that.  Okay, you can do on the table if you want.  no, I do this because  and starting to get big, huh?  Everything is table runs out of Rose. Clearly. They didn't to infinitely many rows.  Cuz the universe is finite. That's what Owen told us. He read it in some book somewhere.  except most things published in the research literature or false so  Yeah, I don't know.  But anyhow, luckily 19 is much less than infinity.  So we were far away from the danger point in the table. So anyhow, I do you find your number 1.046 somewhere in this table. That was cool as  and maybe you felt this during the exam if you were table person.  What happens when your numbers off the table?  Remember that tooth fairy.  Do you like negative 10 or something? Who knows what you got? Anyhow, so if you're over here on the left side of the table, you just come up and it just tells you what okay, you only have a single bound here is going to be more than point two if you care about both tails in life.  Now one thing it's interesting. I wanted to show you just running hypothesis test is often really foolish.  If you know anything about running.  If you ever gone for a run in your life outside of San Diego, you know that the conditions that affect how good your run is or how fast you are.  Have a tremendous relationship to temperature for example humidity alternative other features can dramatically affect things. Okay. So anyhow, here is the Boston Marathon in blue the averaging finishing time and you can see how much incredible variability there is and there's even this little comment are extreme heat led to remarkably slower time. So if you just step back from your data for one second and say what really matters when it comes to average running time. It's not like tiny changes in shoes. Although that does have an attack but it's effective tiny. We really matters is it was 25 degrees hotter and 100% humidity in Boston on that day and if you lived in Boston,  You know how horrible the weather is.  This is why I left.  So anyhow, we got to stop and have a good day everyone.  UC San Diego podcast "
