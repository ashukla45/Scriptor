What if we put lots of events together but none of them overlap so throw down lots of circles on the page, which have no intersections anywhere. So you might believe hey we can just repeatedly do this process. It works for to probably works for more using something called induction.  remember that  Okay, so that's how you can prove a rule like that if you wanted to but I can just tell it to you and you'll be fine and you already do it automatically, so I'm not telling you something is counter-intuitive. So that's nice. Okay. We also learned that if you want to make both events happen if you want a and b to be showing up in your life.  Well, it turns out you can just multiply the probabilities as long as the events are independent. We're going to look at that more today. Once we have some more infrastructure in place. So if the idea of Independence still hard for you, it's okay.  Now what if you put lots of events together and you want them all to occur and all these events a 1 through a k a bunch of them are all independent of one another.  So event A1 has no influence on the others doesn't affect them or their likelihood of occurring the same thing a 2 has no relationship to any of its other friends here. They'll make their decisions in life independently of the others. Well, if you want them all to show up at the party, it's just the probability each one shows up at the party and you can just multiply those together again, you can prove this realtor induction and most people do this automatically, even if I don't tell you this rule,  So this is just putting notation on something that you're so desperately wants to do but you have to remember these rules are conditioned on the first one having just joined this between all the events. So take any two they should have no overlap and the second rule is conditional upon the events being independent from each other take any two they don't influence each other's chance of occurring or not.  As soon as we start to a road those assumptions.  The rules get more complicated. So let's a road destroying this first.  So you want a ven a or b to occur, but maybe they have some overlap together as the picture would indicate now. The overlap of two things is just the and you want a and b both simultaneously to exist so that would be in their intersection.  Okay, so you're somewhere general rule if you want a or b to occur all usually probability of a which is this big red circle here you add on the probability of B, which is the blue circle.  And the phrase ARB should look like this snowman shape. We sort of turned on his side laying in the ground. The problem is when you add the red and blue together you've double-counted.  The overlap here cuz it's in both A and B. So this subtraction is removing your double Counting.  And that's the proof of this rule. You can just use the Venn diagram to convince you.  No notice. Also if you're super smart, here's how you look at the world whenever you learn a fancy rule in life. You say does it compress to an easier rule?  If there's some weird situation, so for example, if the circles didn't overlap if the events were just joint does this rule collapse into our old one?  And the answer is yes, because if they are just joined this final term here is zero.  So for example, when you you learn the Sagarin theorem, right is a two dimensional thing will there's also a three-dimensional version and what you can immediately ask yourself. Once you learn it is does it compress down to the two-dimensional version? So if you have a big three dimensional box and you're taking the diagonal of the box, that's the three-dimensional figure in theorem. Well, if you have the box no height and collapse a way to mention it becomes a rectangle and you should see the two dimensional thing or is very frustrating because there is a probability definition of or which is the following if you want to know what a or b means it means I'm talking about. I want you to be in a but not the this is this moon shape right here in red.  Or it's okay for be but not a so you can be in this blue moon shape.  And I'm also willing to include the final thing A and B. Okay, so the probable list just sort of colors a and colors B and looks for all the pretty colors. They've just drawn and that's what are b means. They're okay with both happening.  It's just more than they wanted and more than you may want it the trouble is that in everyday speech we often use a or b in a way that would suggest I really don't want you to have both. Okay, so here's some examples like when people ask you coffee or tea and be very weird for you to say both.  Right, you could if you're thinking from a probable list of probability Theory sort of perspective Chipotle McDonald's you ever say both.  You do.  Are you think like a probability Theory? So all UCS people have words to distinguish these two kinds of or so a normal or allows both things to have. What's the probability Theory sore, but if you don't if you want to exclude the possibility that someone could take both to you use the phrase X or Forex means to exclude. So all you see is people great have a word. Unfortunately English people to walk around saying Chipotle X or McDonald's.  Cuz America can only take so much intellectualism before you know.  Okay. Anywho, so let's try this.  I want to show you some of the visualization we're going to be using a lot.  And the important thing here, this is an easy problem. You can give this to 3rd or 4th graders.  The thing that we want to do differently is be more serious about the visualization and our notation so that that generalizes and pulls us up by our bootstraps on harder things. So he can you take a bunch of college students 80% will say they like learning at UCSD. Okay. This is a pretty intellectual campus. You might have figured that out by now 70% of people will say they like video games here. You probably know this from old video game clubs that exist on campus the orchestra devoted a video game music and 62% will love both. So this is a intellectual and tech nerd campus is what that means basically was already knew that what percentage like learning or video games.  Okay you seen this in early classes, right? But what's different now? I want us to learn how to put notation on things. So choose a capital letter for an event to the smartest letter. You could if you want to be alphabetical the alphabetical you can also choose things for the letters the first letter of the event idea learning or V4 video games. So very good idea to choose things like this to help remind you so that when you have tons of events, you don't confuse yourself again. This is a skill that will help you be better. Now, you can draw the diagram when you drive your decision to make and draw the circles overlapping or not overlapping with your Dino if there's an overlap or not, this will tell you what you should do. If you don't you can draw them. Overlapping  And if they end up not overlapping you could just imagine a zero in the center there.  That's fine. Okay. So now I need to put all these numbers in now. This is very hard for 3rd or 4th grader. Just so you know, cuz they don't understand all the different kinds of things going on yet Pro tip. It's best to start from the center of the picture. That is the region that has the most intersectional overlap cuz it is the most specified idea. So if you know a great so we have 62 like both so this and statement will be at the intersection of two circles in a Venn diagram now gets harder.  So we have this 80% right 80% like learning.  So this  Fact has no mention of video games. So what do you do is imagine that the blue circle is not even there?  That leaves only the red circle which must be 80 now. Unfortunately, the blue circles dividing up the red circles. You have to make sure it all adds up to 80 is the key here. But when you see what idea mentioned in the other not then you should have raced the blue circle from your head momentarily. Okay, you can do the same thing with the other fact that 70% like video games and finally there's one last area that one could fill in if one wish to fill in that and that's outside both circles. These are people that hate lots of things in life.  So 12% are haters of the things that I asked in my survey. That's fine. I'm sure they'll of lots of other things and there we go.  No defining events using smart letter choices.  Capitalizing things because everyone in the world does and help signify things understanding how your visualization links up to various ideas understand how you're going to feel in your visualization. Okay, that's probably a lot more than you teach a 3rd grader about all of this is my gas. Now the problem wants l or V. That's the Snowman shape in the picture. So you could just add up all of these numbers if you wished you don't have to break out any formulas or now that you know, some formula. You could just plug in all the numbers. So I did this problem to show you you didn't really have to do anything fancy to get the answer.  Okay, I gave you the exact three numbers you needed you could have just plug them into some formula. But what we did here is we tied together algebra and visualization and we learned ways to make all of this smarter and more rigorous and more thoughtful about what we're doing so that carries us forward. So I would try all those protips. Have you talked to numbers and visualizations?  So give me words for what this number .18 means.  glad  percent of people that only like learning  I think that's what it's going to say if I Advance the slide.  You doubt him?  You do. What do you think it is?  Learning and not video people that like learning and not video games. Is that what you meant in your soul?  See yours was like learning only what what about all the other things in life that mean to only like learning set me up to hate everything else in life.  Oh, you're right. There's nothing else in life. But learning in video games. You're right. So your things are equivalent. But if there are more things in life than learning and video games, maybe your statement is not the same as his statement. This is a little better cuz it assumes maybe there are other things in life. You can see like I knew that I knew that you were saying the same thing and if I put on something clever in the C language is so frustrating, right? Okay, let's do another  508 + 2.62  No one knows.  Go ahead.  People that likes video games what you think? Okay. There we go. Who knows but we know they like video games.  Be careful. Go ahead.  People that don't like video games and learning at the same time.  Does that mean at the same time but they don't want to be learning as video games are happening.  Did you want to use the word and in that statement?  Do you need or you want to order that means and in English?  someone else  I'm not saying you're right or wrong. I just want to hear from someone else and see what they think.  people who dislike learning  And just like video games.  So you change not like to dislike. Are those the same thing?  I said I'm slow at running and we took the negation of that is not slow equal to fast.  English is such a hot mess people who just like learning and disliked video games. There's all sorts of problems with trying to use English. So I'm just trying to be super nitpicky to show you all of the stupid problems. We have in our language because it's imprecise is why mathematics is better in some situations. Finally Point 1/8 + 2.08.  I'm a new.  Go ahead.  Who am I?  People that like learning or like video games, but not both.  Computer science people. Go ahead.  People that like either which is either.  I am either a male or female in a gender binary world.  But you I don't know what they mean by. Okay, so I like the first thing like learning orbit against but not both that's one way of saying it all you computer scientists will say like learning X or video games.  you think either means X or  You do.  Well, it depends on how you think about the word to either in English.  Sometimes it means or sometimes it means X or it depends on the person that depends on the day. You'll watch and watch yourself both ways the word either or or maybe like both ways sometimes inclusive or exclusive our table you have two categorical variables one of the press the top and the others across the side and then people are being categorized based on how they fit into your two categorical variables, which might have lots of options here. Each categorical variable only has two things because I'm assuming simple binaries in life to make things easier. Now the cool thing is all these numbers over here will show up in a contingency table, but it also has more numbers in it. So in some sense, it's a superior visualization because it has more information and some sensitive.  Carrier visualization because it doesn't leverage the human visual complex like a Venn diagram does and you see and feel that it is just numbers presented, right? Okay, so you can see all four of these numbers right here show up Central to the table that is non margins in case they're inside the table here. So this is one of the three kinds of probabilities. You should know the three kinds distinguish them and they should be in your soul and there are only three kinds first joint. This is the probability where you joined forces of two things happening. Okay, though always have hands in them. For example .08 is just like learning and simultaneously.  like in video games  Okay, so these are all joints in here and the Venn diagram if you feel it inappropriately will have all joints in it.  The next are called marginal probabilities because in a contingency table, they are in the margins. That's where the name comes from. They're not as easy to see in the Venn diagram. Although they are there. So 70% if you look at that, it's telling you what percentage of people like video games and it's marginalizing or ignoring the other variable in the problem, which is learning.  Okay, if you want to see this in a Venn diagram that .7 you got to add up all the stuff in the green circle here. So they're there you just have to work to get them.  Okay. So these are two of the three kinds and these are super important to understand these anytime you see a probability and it talks about one of your ideas and ignores the other instantly know it's a marginal probability. So a third grader reading our little problem about video games and learning doesn't sit here and say oh, okay. Well as I'm reading this, I'm in my head categorizing this 80% like learning no mention of video games marginal probability when they go to draw their Venn diagram. Okay with that marginal thing is like, oh I need to make a full circle out of 2.8. That's what's going on.  Okay, so there now, let's see how you do?  It'll be interesting. Here's a problem.  Now I want to start raining. You do not copy this block of text from my screen to your piece of paper that is a waste of time already know that you can write English right and you have all the slides online. So what you should be doing this just reading it and it's instantly start working the problem. So spend your time in life Cog with cognition not just writing things sometimes writing things builds cognition, obviously.  So, let's see. How you doing this problem.  And again, don't waste your time.  Teacher service password Twitter Instagram to don't use Instagram 38 don't use Twitter. What is the probability of randomly chosen person? The class will be on Insta, but not Twitter.  So just get your brain going so we'll start the clock.  As you can see in red at the top it says use a contingency table 24 shoe.  to use a certain kind of visualization  three out of four people are using Venn diagrams. The problem says use a contingency table.  That's a 3 minutes feels like that's so generous with my time.  So this is a great problem where when I look at those. I don't actually really need to make sense of it at all.  I just know this feels like a contingency table would help cuz I'm organizing data and I'm just going to process it and put it in the table in real time. I'm not going to try to get like a high-level view of everything spend time thinking about intricacies of these numbers. Okay, so I put the table twenties both boom. Both is a joint probability talked about both of them are occurring simultaneously.  10 years neither that's also a joint you're saying both are in the no 72 don't use Instagram pay this feels like a marginal idea. Twitter Twitter is not mentioned at all. Right, so I know the things to do up here in a margin.  38 don't use Twitter again. Marginal. That's how I look at this and read this.  Okay. Now the cool thing is all these numbers add up right so you can figure out this 28 right here and you could add a cross to get a 48 if you wished.  They don't have to fill in the whole table everyone I walk to who said they were done had killed in the whole table. That's not the optimal solution. It's to do the minimal amount of force. It still get you to the answer. Right? So probability of randomly chosen student. So if you want a probability you need to divided by the total number of people that is why I'm currently working my way over to this beautiful box right here in the lower right box will always have the total number of people doesn't matter. If you add up these margins on the right side or the margins across the bottom that you can check your answer cuz the margin should vote that up for 1:20. So that is one reason to complete the full table has a check on yourself. But in the end all we care about is being the Instagram but not Twitter, which is this number right here 28 and dividing it by the total 7/30 not going to guess your way into that answer right and when you see it, if you feel like I owe that's disgusting recalibrate your emotion and say, of course Corpus going to give us discussing numbers to recalibrate our emotions.  Okay.  Keep going what percentage of students who is exactly one of the two social media websites.  You are feeling nervous because I was hovering over you that's designed to make you feel nervous.  So that you will believe in yourself and not use my position in geolocation Lee relative to you to decide if he wants a ride or not use your brain to decide if your answers right or not, not me hovering or not. We need this box. Finally this isn't it? Yes or no Duality here. 6228 Adam you get 3/4 I chose 3/4 here because it was so beautiful that you might say why it shouldn't be disgusting and we could swing the other way. Now you have to expect beautiful or disgusting things. Okay now it is time for the front under stand but it's actually the tool we're going to need most frequently and hard problems. So whenever you have events that depend on each other that is there some relationship between these two events conditional probability will help you study them and it's what you do when Independence is lost.  from your infrastructure of events  So the idea is simple when you make the decision about a probability of something occurring, sometimes you have some information and it influences your decision making process. In fact, this is basically always true in life. It's very hard to make a decision devoid of information completely devoid in case you conditioning your decisions based on other information and that's what conditional probability does. So here's an example going to rain today in San Diego and then to be you see some dark storm clouds in the sky. So if I just asked you about a and you just woken up and you can't even see what's going on outside.  Your answer for a but it's going to rain today is going to be low because you know, it doesn't rain often in San Diego.  If however I let you look outside and you confirm that event B has occurred.  Suddenly that dramatically changes your feeling about a right. So the probability you want to assign to a depends on or is conditioned on Weatherby occurs or isn't occurring. What do you have information about be? Okay, so maybe it's .02 and then it changes and goes much higher when she learned be that's the idea right there. We make decisions about things often based on other information. So yours are notation.  This is p of a Barbie. That's not how you say this. But that's the symbols you right since the probability that event a occurs case of this probability is all about trying to assess what's going on with the first thing that it sees the a  the bar can be read as given. So what it means is you know, for sure the thing to the right side of the bar has occurred.  For whatever reason you get to assume that's true. So you're trying to assess the probability of a with some information in your back pocket known as be okay. So this is a conditional probability in that bar. UCSD conditioning bar. You're making decisions about a  Whitby in the hand, okay. So let's see if you can figure out which of these two ideas is bigger. So one of them is a conditional probability and the other is just a marginal that doesn't mention the other one. So is the left or is the right most likely bigger?  I'm going to raise your hand and commit.  Can you just reiterate which one you have is bigger?  The left one is you point to your right?  You pointed to my left in your right, so I don't know what's going on.  You pointed to your right as you said my left.  This one the right side. Okay good. So the percentage people to get in a final is maybe 20 or 30%  if a random person, you know, I studied 100 hours or some very high chance. They're going to get an a right. So like you said you had a nice idea there. You see yourself to this tiny population of really hard working people and that's where most of the A's are in a class. Okay.  Probability of random person to play in the NFL the probability that play in the NFL if I tell you their binary gender designation as female.  No one knows, go ahead.  There's more men in the NFL you say she like the one on the left. Okay, so this you can just answer through data that you can just say like all the people in the US or whatever population and see what percent go on to the NFL that's like .00 1% And then you can limit yourself to just looking at women and say what percentage of those go on to the NFL and that number currently a 0-0. So obviously this number on the left is positive and that's just a function that no one in the NFL currently is female has she said he said there more men that is true. It's not the cleanest most informative statement. Let's try another one given a random person find a curtain. I tell you they identify as female.  Go ahead.  Start again and louder, please.  You think the one on the right is slightly bigger?  Sorry tell you figure there then. Why didn't you say I think they're equal?  accounting for possibility of air  maybe your word to the problem says which is bigger you feel like you have to follow my directions to a T.  So now you think they're equal.  I want to change your answer again.  You're sure really a good don't let my stupid nonsense change what you believe. These are equal depend on the gender of a random person behind a curtain.  probably  I don't know maybe all weather is determined by the ratio of gender and some City at some given point in time or some nonsense. I don't understand the universe. So they're probably the same as my guess. I imagine most people would probably agree with that. I don't know. Okay, so there's some conditional probability stuff.  How do you go use this? Well, first you can put it into a definition you can say events A and B. I'm going to Define them to be independent if the following occurs the probability of a whatever number that is.  Is equal to the probability of a when I tell you that B has occurred so, you know Bea is sitting out there in the universe and you're like I don't really care as the same for me. It doesn't depend on the information about be so independent events sort of wipe away any conditioning it's irrelevant to figuring out what's going on with a which is a cool thing. So this is how I think about independent events once you know conditional probability now the other day we played this game over and over at the end of class.  Okay, and I put up this little slide about how to decide if things are independent. So I said find the probability of something you care about or estimated and then we found it again, but this time I gave you some information.  And sometimes it changed your opinion about a and sometimes it didn't we're doing things with like Harvard acceptances and that kind of thing, right? Okay. So what I was basically doing is having you find P of a having you find P of a again with some knowledge.  Asking you to compare the two and see if you felt like you got the same answer basically.  And if you didn't get the same answer, that's when A & B are independent.  I usually play this game in a certain way ask you about event and then I'll give you a different event and ask you about the original event again, but you can play the game backwards.  Okay, so you could say all that to ask about be and then let's ask about be given a  so playing the game one way cuz you Independence it turns out playing at the other way will also give you an independence and you can go prove that if you know some fancy stuff. So if you're like a math major and you'll approving things you can try to do that.  And one of the cool things about independence is it gives you away to think about social justice? So if this is something the matter to you social justice, sometimes it's just a statement of Independence. Okay. So probability someone's female.  That's a number 51.5% in America.  If I tell you the random person behind the curtain works at Google and then I asked you for their gender.  assuming a gender binary  If it changes your idea about How likely they are to be female then we have a social justice problem.  Where there is somehow a dependence between your gender and whether you can get a job with Google?  Which app for many people would be a real issue. Okay probability your friend gets pulled over what what if I tell you their race?  Ideally would not like that to change the probability that they'll get pulled over if those turn out to be equal. Then you have a police force that has decoupled or made independent racing pulling over.  But in many cities you can see that these numbers are dramatically different.  As soon as you know, someone's race, it's like boom. They're probably getting pulled over goes out 2050 a hundred times more likely so this is pretty scary and you might want to like what is a nice way to take probability theory in embedded in social justice issues.  Okay. Now how do we embed conditional things into tables? So let's figure that out. So here's our good table. We've been working on so I could ask a question here. Like what's the probability someone in this random class 520 peoples on Twitter. That's no mention of Instagram. So it's a marginal idea. So you'll go to margins to figure it out. So I'm going to fill in the one number that's left. That's all the people on Twitter and I'll divide that by the total. So 60% of this class is on Twitter or if you think about another way if you pull a random number from the class, there's a 64 chance 60% chance. They'll be on Twitter now, it's ask a conditional questions.  So I want to know the chance someone's on Twitter. If you are told they absolutely are on Instagram.  So the way you do something like this is because this is to the right of the conditioning bar. You know, it is true.  So the universe is no longer this entire table. It is just the portion of the table where Instagram usage is true. So you limit yourself to this road right here. That's your new universe that Universe only has 48 people in it.  And if you want to know what percent of Twitter users you could take the Twitter. Yes and divided by the total Universe you're in so here we have 20 / 48.  So it actually made the chance that their Twitter person go down.  when I told you they were an Instagram person, why might that be true  real life emotional stuff  glad  Okay, you said not all people want to social media accounts? So if you know they have one.  There's less chance of that second one in this particular medium known as Twitter. There's one very nice answer you another one.  Also, it is the person's Instagram user may be there in Instagram meme mining user. They like the Instagram memes and they just like the Twitter memes.  Quite possible you a different one.  Okay, something about the popularity you could also use another argument which is about the nature of the platform's Instagram has a very visual platform Twitter is a very character heavy platform people that like visual things may not like the written things. I don't know this new to see this instantly for good reasons that I could believe. Okay. So these two ideas are dependent they are not independent. So hear the knot idea is nice is not independent dependent. It's not disjoint.  It's not disjoint. There's no nice word there, unfortunately.  Okay.  Now all our contingency table so far. I've been full of numbers, but they could be full of probabilities as well and to convert from one to the other. All you have to do is divide the table with numbers by the biggest number which is 120. So if you divide that into every single cell hear it converts it over to probabilities and you can see there must be one in the lower right corner if you're working with probabilities.  Okay. So let's try another one probably low Facebook user given female. So this is a breakdown of human beings on two categorical variables. One is a trinary of Facebook usage. If you believe people can be put in China Aries and the Ender at the others are silly gender trying to gender binary.  But I'm using over and over to emphasize how exhausting binary and ternary can be. Okay. So here's a bunch of people. So how would you do something like that swell to the right of the conditioning bars, which I know to be true. So you can limit your Universe to just people that identify as female in this binary designation. So that's only 55% of the population. And then what would your asking about is trying to get people to be low Facebook users see who pulled that number is the numerator so there's that fraction, so it's not about counts anymore. It's about probabilities.  But all the same calculus works here. Okay. So anyhow, anytime you want to find a conditional probability if it's in a table, then you already know what to do because I've used this limiting Universe metaphor. If you just have numbers written all over the page, then this is the formula you can use and you can see it's derived from the table idea. Okay, when I asked you about this which of the idea on the right limit ourselves to that universe and that made the denominator and then we took the idea on the left and we said, okay we need to get that also.  In addition to being in the row we need to get ourselves into the correct column. So that's actually an and statement cuz you've limited yourself to the row and then got into the right column. So what school here in unifies all three kinds of probability together a conditional probability is equal to the ratio of a joint probability and a marginal probability.  amazing  so beautiful  Now it's time for you to do things. Let's go to Socrative hear the goal is to get all 10. Correct? You'll be in roughly increasing order of difficulty and we'll see how you do against these are not graded for those at home wondering whether they have to come to class or not. I also wanted to show you that these are completely Anonymous you can see me requiring names right here and sending this to know and you never enter anything about you, right? So I have no idea and Anonymous data.  Are often the best data?  Okay, what's probably a male and medium Facebook user?  Here you go.  The room name is my initials DQ.  You notice I reveal the answer and move on when roughly two-thirds of the class according to this have answered. There's some lag in the transfer of data. We higher than 2/3 and I want to give you a sense of roughly how fast you want to be working.  Okay, 85% of the Class C I T the word and and I think joint probability joint probabilities Right light Central to the table cuz you sell to mail get shells to medium Facebook user and you get point one and that's how you do that.  probability of male  Okay, there's 96% You can see these have explanations often so male no mention of the other idea, which is Facebook is Eunice. So this is a marginal probability. So go to a margin pull out the number that's appropriate .45, which number is not a joint probability in the table.  There's two thirds.  Okay, the joints are Central right here all the joints in this to buy three Arrangement. So you're looking over here. So any of those numbers that show up on the list of the correct answer? So there's .6  male or low Facebook users  male or low  We're down to only 60% getting them, correct.  Okay cannot be determined. So the people that pick this.  Don't play this game where you try to game the system and choose the answer on a standardized test of the SAT. That would often be the right answer right? I have to read the problem and it's usually the right answer on the SAT, but I put it in there to throw you off. So you stop using that convention.  Can absolutely be determined male and low Facebook. So we want these people in those people in those people. Now we want no Facebook. We've already counted these people. So what's left is to count these ones sound so you can't decide .1 in .45 because they're not disjoint and check their join is right here at this joint probability 2005.  Can we get it lower than 60%  female given medium Facebook  What percent of medium Facebook users happen to identify as female if you force them into binaries?  Okay, this is what happens when you do lots of examples of this idea right before it pushes it higher.  Okay, let me yourself to the medium Facebook universe and then pick out the women.  probability of medium Facebook giving female  Okay, people are getting better do examples people get better. That's what this showed for two events A&B. We must have P of a given b equals P of B given a  This is super interesting to see what happens here.  This is what happens when you take smart people they notice what just happened in there life on the previous two problems, right? You just saw through an actual example that if you change the conditioning you don't necessarily get the same thing. So really matters The Ordering of the conditioning probability of male given not low Facebook.  if you're not low Facebook you're in one of the first true columns that is your universe that Universe has a total of 90% of people in it that's the denominator the numerator is the binary male decision of point for so it should be point for / .9 and how'd we do very good. That's all my time  I'll see you Wednesday. Thanks for working hard.  Offer up one more if you want to do it while you're leaving class.  UC San Diego podcast "
