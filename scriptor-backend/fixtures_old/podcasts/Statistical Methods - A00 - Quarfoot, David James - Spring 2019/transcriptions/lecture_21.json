    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Welcome back.  Voice is getting better.  Didn't cough at all last night and actually sleep.  Okay, we're going to go back and pick something up from the past and then today is going to be one of the toughest days if I must be honest about what's ahead of us.  We broke the internet.  Oh my goodness.  Try again.  Technical problems. Sorry people at home.  Okay, I guess we do this old school for a while.  When's the last time you had an old-school one?  Oh my goodness. Okay. So here we go.  So we have to talk about the types of errors that exist. So there's a serious problem. We've been making all these decisions in life right up through hypothesis tests. But the problem is when you make a decision, you may not have made the right decision. I know this is hard to believe in life, but you're going to make mistakes.  Now there's two things that are going on one thing is called the truth of the universe. This is if you could actually call up the universe and say what's going on.  Now you never can really do this, right?  But it's something that's out there. If you believe that the Universe has a truth then there's the decision you make in life in this is based on some data.  And so you have some null and alternative hypothesis and you end up somewhere, right? So it's possible that a synod is really true if you called up the universe and it's possible that it's not as false. If you want you can think about this is the alternative is what's actually true.  Okay, so then what could happen when you run a hypothesis test you might decide to believe?  NH not after the whole test is done or you might decide you're going to move to the alternative.  So in some of these situations you've made great choices and another choice and other situations you've made a huge mistake, right? So if it's not as actually true if you call it the universe and because of your data you into believing that's not this is a good thing, right?  And so is the case that if the alternative is true and you end up moving to it, so these are both good things.  You get a little check mark But then of course.  There's the bad possibilities. So sometimes the nose actually going to be true, but you're going to end up moving to the alternative. So this is an error and it is a type 1 error.  Okay, they just had to put some numbering system on this are so there's our type one. It's the one that you're  Going to make a lot.  Because in life usually work from the assumption that the null is true. And so you move away from it. This other one is called a type 2 error.  I hopefully you took a look at this in the slides. This was from many lectures ago, but we didn't get time to get to it.  And so the first question is what's the probability that you're going to make a type 1 error in life?  Well, the only way you'll ever know this.  Is ethanol is actually true, but you have no way of knowing that so the only way to make a type 1 error again is if the no was actually true if you called up the universe, so it's a very hard thing to figure out.  Unless we say okay. Let's just assume Knowles are true for a while. You're studying something other than old is true.  Okay, so what could happen well when you go collect some data.  You take their average and that gives you a particular value of x bar. And then what happens? Well, you do something with that X bar. So maybe you figure out a penile you based on.  Maybe you build a confidence interval. Whatever Direction you go in life. You're particular about bars one value from the sampling distribution of what could have happened and if the null is really true.  If you call up the universe and say hey what's going on then?  This graph must be centered at Mew whatever the actual value is for what you're trying to study.  Okay, so the nose actually true.  Then what the universe wants to give you is data.  Chris average is around meu University want to lie to you, right?  But every once in awhile it will okay. So most of the time if you look here, I don't know what to say like 95% of the time the universe is going to try to give you an average that's near the truth of the universe can be Trixie on rare occasion. And sometimes it'll give you a value. It's just a little far outside of what's really going on over here in the Tails. It's possible right? It's rare.  Okay. So the question is How likely are you to get something out here? Because if you get something out here in the Tails if this is your value of x bar.  Then if you're a p-value person what happens as you go and start shading things.  Okay, so you go and shade this area. Maybe it's one-sided.  Let's see how well we can get this to actually work.  Take care. Okay, we're back up.  Some sort of Miracle Works for one person, but not another.  Insanity is what it is.  I just don't get this world sometimes anyhow, so here we are.  What's this fall apart as soon as we try?  amazing  Miracle okay. Anyhow  Okay, so if the Knoll is really true, what it means is when you ask the universe for an average going to try to give you an average in your the truth.  Okay, and when you start exploring if that was weird or not, it's only if that average falls in the extreme tails that you're going to be misled and move over to the alternative. Okay. So then the question is what How likely are you to land in those extreme tails? And that's a very rare event.  Okay, so the answer of how how often you're going to learn too far away from you and use a P value or confidence interval start getting confused about life that turns out to be related to this value that we've been doing all this time. So what you can really show here and now we're going back and forth between boards and Technology. It's all getting confusing. You can show that your probability of making a type 1 error. It's just whatever you've said alfa-2b you said elephants were to visit this threshold that if you got a result that was this weird you would have banned in your belief system.  And if the no really is true, it doesn't want to give you weird values. It wants to give you quite natural values.  Okay. So this is your probability of making a type 1 error so you can actually control this by setting whatever outfit you want in life.  And this is really the vote the value of choosing a certain kind of elephant. You're controlling your type 1 error rate.  Okay. So this is one of the kinds of errors it's going to happen in life. The other is the tattoo are that we mentioned on the board.  Okay. So what is this? Well?  If the Knoll was actually false.  If the alternative is true visit you not rejecting the null to sitting with anole.  Okay. So this is a bad kind of air it means something exciting is going on in the universe there alternative is true.  But when you go collect your data and do a bunch of fanciness.  You don't discover. The cool result is going on out there. Some people would say this is really a bad thing supposed to really have the cure for cancer.  And you go give it to a bunch of people and for some reason the data mislead you and you're like a doesn't work. I don't know what's wrong. What's just missed the cure for cancer. That's a pretty big kind of are. Okay. So there's some probability associated with this now, you can't calculate this based on our existing framework. Okay, so we need a new letter here will give it beta.  Just following in the Greek alphabet.  And we have to figure out how to find that now one of the important things related to Beta is its complementary probability. Okay. This is known as the power of a test and then we're going to talk about today. This is very important actually. So the power of a test is the probability.  That if the null is false or if you like the alternative is true.  I'll let you decide what you want to put here. It's a probability that you will reject the null when you do some sort of fancy test.  That is if there's something interesting going on those false How likely are you to come to that realization?  So this will be the complement of beta you can see that beta and power both have the condition Innovation that is false and all they do is swap the first idea from keep Knoll to reject null. So that's why they have to be complementary.  Okay. Now if you want you can go look at with these look like in the real world and practice that for a while, but let's go onto the new thing.  I very little hope the computers going to work here.  miracle  you came in just at the right miracle moment when the technology all worked. I probably taught that was in classes.  Maybe 2,000 don't even know what the number is by now and this is like the worst technological experience out of all 1000. So you just seen her one out of a thousand event. Were you excited?  Did it meet your Alpha threshold? I don't know.  Okay. So now that we have some basis we're going to move forward and talk about some hard things here. So people always ask me to come to mean they're like, oh you do statistics, right? Okay when we're on the study how many people do I need? It's very natural question, right?  But the trouble is it's very complicated answer and one thing you'll find is if you're trying to decide how big you want some studying to be there all these variables that come into play. So for example,  there is a cost to doing everything money time.  And there's also a human cost sometimes maybe want your study to be people carrying radioactive materials on their back.  And you're curious if it's bad or not. Well, maybe it'll want to put a lot of people through this study because guess what you could kill everybody in your study. Maybe have a new drug your testing maybe a cures cancer, but maybe it kills people to whoops.  Okay, so just a lot of like Risk to participants cost to consider guy sometimes the reason you collect a certain sample size is cuz you want your sampling distribution to look a certain way.  Maybe really wanted to look like a t distribution. That would be nice. Maybe you're studying something. That's really skewed Sunita large and value.  Okay, sometimes you want to make sure you don't miss a real effect. And this last one is the idea of powers or something exciting going on. I want to know it. I don't want to miss it.  Okay, so often these things are at odds, that's the frustrating thing obviously to get nice sampling distributions. You need big sample sizes, but unfortunately that makes the cost go up. So it's a frustrating reality of doing any kind of study that they're competing forces.  Okay, so let's think about power. So again we Define this as a probability.  I'm moving to the alternative.  If the alternative is actually true that is it for something exciting going on How likely are you to discover it? Some people use the word effects.  So they say there's a true effect like your drug increases people's happiness has that's in effect. Right and true in the sense that it did something. So it should probability of finding the true fact if it's there now you're so weird thing.  I don't know if you felt it too deep in your bones yet. But every time you do hypothesis testing, it's always under the assumption that the null is true.  So we have this weird conflict, which is the way we think in life is if there's something exciting going on. I want to find it.  That's all it infrastructure where you assume.  Are you working based on the assumption that the note was false? But whenever you do inference, your infrastructure is built around each not being true.  What a weird world we have.  And this is one of the frustrations around testing is the awkwardness here.  Okay, so let's figure out how to resolve these two How likely am I to find it exciting effect If there really is one out there.  now  Swirling at the center of all of this discussion or so many things. There's some Alpha thing the significance level we have control over. There's some sample size that we kind of have control over but we're restrained in certain ways. There's the fact of is there anything really interesting going on or not? Only the universe knows that but I can't call it up cuz I don't have that phone yet in case you all these things are tied together in some interesting way. So let me show you how to visualize Everything at Once basically  So we need to draw something called a truth of the universe curve and then we're going to draw a niche not sampling distribution were going to put lots of pictures on the page at once. Okay, so here's our little set up your friend to see if you can send on average 37 text messages a day.  Sound right sound wrong.  I know we're going to go figure it out. You think it's lower you're so busy with all that school work, right?  So let's start building and infrastructure first thing the final parameter if we could talk to every UCSD student every single day ever.  And look at their phones and get the truth. We could find the average number of text messages sent per day.  Impossible right but it's the theoretical ideal. Okay. So be really boring if the number were 37 and were excited about the alternative which claims it slower.  Okay, so if you started collecting data and running tests building confidence intervals, you would do them using this curve.  The sampling distribution which assumes H not is true.  That is you go out to the world collecting data believing that 37 is the truth.  I'm hoping to get 37. I think I'm going to get 37. I'm going to gauge everything I see in the world against 37.  Hey, so this is a sampling distribution. Assuming H not it's your goggles you put on and you're going to measure the universe against what you see through them.  And noticed right here. It's centered at 37. You're expecting to see an average near there. This is a picture of what the average could look like. It's X bars distribution.  Okay. Now it happens to be a t distribution.  But we are going to assume it's a normal distribution because otherwise these calculations are undoable in some settings. So this is one of the only times  if we're working with means we will go back to our dream world of the normal distribution.  Are you okay with that?  I know I just keep pulling you backwards and forwards on what's really true. Okay hits of this is sampling distribution. Assuming H not.  It's our way of thinking about and looking at the world and making decisions about the world and it's only 10 or 2:37 because we adopted a belief it could be stupid. Okay. Now with these glasses on we make a decision about the null vs. Alternative.  Based on What's called the rejection fence.  Okay. So this is the place that if the X bar falls on one side of we're going to throw out everything we believe in and move to the alternative and if expires on the other side, we're going to keep  Pinole  any interesting thing is this rejection fence is decided upon by whatever Elsa is. Okay. So the area over here to the left of the rejection fence is what elf is .05. I've been in some cases in case you're staying or something is in the 5% smallest averages.  It's really hard to believe in a world center 237 anymore.  That's why you moved to your alternative, right?  Okay, so normally what we do is we just throw down our average in shade and trying to get the area less than .05 here were thinking about it slightly differently. We're just saying what would be the point Beyond which?  Things are getting too weird. So now we draw a second distribution.  On the same picture. Okay. Now the blue curve is what we think is going on. It's how we view the world.  But when you actually go collect data, they don't care what you believe in.  I don't care what goggles you're currently wearing. The universe just gives you data based on what actually true, right?  So this whole time?  You have to really imagine a second curve drawn here and read and this is the universe trying to give us averages. We look at them in relation to the blue curve, but they come from the red curve.  Oh.  This is amazing. I love this the first time you see it.  You have to always remember.  The universe doesn't care about your belief system. It gives you data from whatever is true.  There's Randomness and what's happening and the you the date of you end up getting but you analyze them in one lens or space.  Which comes from the data come from a different place the power the power the probability, right and probabilities are areas.  So something in that picture if you shaded it would give the power.  Go ahead.  You said the area of the dashed red curve? Can you change the word of to something better?  We're finding area.  Underneath very nice the area underneath the red curve to the left side of the dashed rejection Pence you said so why do you think that's true? Why did you say that?  Cuz we're looking at protecting.  Very nice. That was amazing. Have you ever done this before?  You just good just happens. That was amazing. Okay, if there's a true fact that means there's a red curve that exists and it's different than the blue curve.  If there's no to affect the red and blue curves are the same curve actually.  Okay, so it means there's a red curve and the data must be coming from the red curve.  Hey now, if you're going to reject, it's not you just need to be on the left side of the rejection fence.  Okay, so you shade under the red curve?  pain on the left side  Okay. So the question is why did I draw the red curve to the left of the blue curve?  Okay, I made a choice. I called up the universe and said hey what's going on? The red Turf could actually be to the right of the blue curve. It would be a weird thing because the red curve is telling you if you look at word centered. It's telling you how many text messages student send on average. So we currently you're trying to hope it show it's less than 37. So if the Red Cross on the other side of the blue curve, it would mean we are exactly opposite of what was actually going on. Now that can happen people believe all sorts of opposite things from reality. Right, but I just do it there to harmonize with what's going on in the problems or doesn't hurt as much.  Okay, so right there is the power the Shaded area MK the red is giving us data sets and we're finding their X bars and then were using the rejection fence. We think we're in the blue universe and the blue universe is what gave rise to the rejection fence.  But it's actually the red curve that gives us data. Okay, so our sample comes from the truth of the universe, but we decide how to interpret it.  Is it weird or not based on the blue curve?  Okay, so when you choose your sample size in a study.  What you're trying to do is balance a million things at once. Okay, how much money do we have to run for the study? What kind of type 1 error rate are we going to accept but also importantly  You want to think about the power?  Okay in this picture shows you a way to calculate to the power.  Okay. So in general people would like to have powers around 80 or 90% that is if something is exciting is going to go on and I'm going to waste all my time and money doing the study. I want a really high percentage chance that the universe will give me a data set that helps me realize that something exciting and interesting is going on.  Now if you're still looking at literature people run incredibly underpowered studies in case near 50%  Guess what? This means is maybe you actually do have the cure to cancer you're flipping a coin to decide whether your study will help you see that or not seems like a pretty silly thing, right?  We'll try problem here. Let's just test to see if y'all are happier than average Americans. Do you think y'all are happier?  No, this is the best life ever.  Oh, there's other things in your life besides 183 I forgot.  Okay.  So you want to run the study right now? There's some way of measuring happiness. There's lots of scales will use the happiness index.  Is like a well-known scale that exists so Americans have and happiness index of 31.  That's not very good. Right and here's how spread out their happiness is our  UDraw sample size 40 seems like a big number, right?  if the true happiness of y'all is really  35  how powerful is this test?  So what this is really asking is if you have a situation where you'd basically comparing the numbers 31 and 35 and using 40 data points to help you sort things out how well can you see that difference?  In a sample of size 40 like is it enough data to help you realize you really have different things going on?  I'm eating about this way suppose you two really big families babies have like 50 people in them or something and you want to know if there's an IQ difference between these two families.  Would you feel good about drawing one person from each and just seeing?  Think that's going to give you the truth. What if you talk to people from each and average them and compare?  And look how many people do you need? Like how good is it to use a certain number of people to do this? Okay. So first thing we're going to set up the parameters and hypotheses is what you always do right? So the only thing I'm excited about is y'all's happiness average.  Y'all heard what we're going to sample from we completely understand America.  Cuz we've asked everyone I guess and gotten 31 as their number. So Mew is your average happiness.  And we can Define this is all math 183 students all people in this class, whatever we can to find some big group everyone ever that will take math 183 future and past. I don't know.  And we set up these hypotheses because the problem was excited about them not because of the data that appear in the problem.  Okay. So what this does is it tells you what goggles you're about to put on what belief system you're going to adopt. You assume the know which means I think y'all are just like America.  And you just 30 ones now when I go actually get your info doesn't matter what I believe you tell me the truth, right? You're the true distribution and I'm just looking so we need to go to distributions and problems will always force you to do this and then you need to go find a bunch of things about them and we'll go through it. All of these things are okay. So dry yourself to sampling distributions. Now one of them the one based on age not and blew its Center is dictated by the fact that you assumed a belief system. You think you're going to get averages near 31. That's why the blue curve is centromere 31.  Now the truth is and I told you it in the problem.  It's y'all are a 35 happiness.  Okay, so when we go collect some data and average, it doesn't matter what I believe the universe is going to get us an average near 35.  Now I'm driving normal curves here. There really should be some t-distribution nonsense, but we're keeping it simple, right?  Now you remember these are just normal distributions are sampling distributions their picture of averages. So you've got to think about how spread out they are known or knew that you need to say. Well, what's the standard deviation of the idea you were trying to measure individual people's happiness is  And what are we doing? We're averaging together. So and it's 40. So the standard error tells you how spread out the blue and the red curbs are.  Now there's an issue of like are these equally spread out?  Does my belief about has spread out you are match how spread out you really are. So in this problem, I only gave you one standard deviation. They give you the number 12, so you have no choice but to just use it everywhere.  Okay, so there's house spread out these curves are now the next thing we're going to go do is we're going to figure out where the rejection fence is.  Okay. So this is a fact about the blue Universe. It's you with your goggles on trying to decide if you're going to call data crazy or normal.  Now this problem maybe we'll use .05. And so what we're going to do is thinking about the blue curve here. We're going to say I'd like to find the top 5% area or the place on the horizontal axis, which is 95% of the area below it and 5% above it.  Now I'm using sort of a one-sided idea here because if you look back at the hypotheses were only really excited about huge averages things much bigger than 31.  Okay, so I want 95% of the area on the blue curve. So you see me typing this into our right here, right? So it's centered at 31 and we just figured out it's spread out, Miss.  And this picture of the number 34 and that's the location of the rejection fence. So anytime you get an average to the right of it. We're like wow, that was really big for 31 Universe supposed to be alternative in anytime you go to Value to the laughter like head. That's not that weird. I was kind of expecting that I think the world near 31 and I got something new.  Quesadilla the rejection fence and I like to write rejecting T patient out on both sides just to help remind me if you draw this picture, which should be forced to do all the time. It will really help you. Okay. The last name is we wanted to find the power right? How good  Is our current proposed test so we need to shave the appropriate area. So power is about a true effect going on that is a red curve.  But we're making decisions about what to do in life based on a blue curve in a rejection fence that comes from it. So this is the area we would like to find.  Now to find this is just an area under a curve.  So you need some for the P Norm calculation. So all you do is type the rejection Fence location and then tell that you want to say to the right, but you have to remind yourself you're on the red curve now, so it's centered at 35.  It has the same spread out in this is everything else in the picture.  Okay, so we get point six seven eight. So this is the power.  And it tells us how good this test is that we just created so basically if you're going to go as 40 people.  40a y'all and to tell me how happy you are in an average it together.  I'm going to get an average and then I'm going to decide what to do with it based on the blue curve and the rejection fence was telling us that 68% of the time.  We will end up at the right answer.  I'm going to end up rejecting a snot and say know you're happier than average Americans.  But 32% of the time the red Curve will give us a weird average to look at all these weird averages over here there to the left of the Shaded region. That's the red from giving us weird stuff that actually harmonizes with the blue picture.  It makes a lot of sense in the blue world.  Why is the world so complicated?  Okay, so that's a power calculation now, there's something weird. You probably felt there.  Don't you feel like I just cheated in order to decide how good a test was. I was going to run. Look what I had to tell you what the very beginning I had to tell you what you were going to believe 31 and I told you the truth.  Why run the study if I tell you the truth, right?  So this may feel a little phony in order to decide how good a thing is. You have to know what's actually going on in the universe.  You're not probably not going to know that ever.  So let me show you what really happens those in dream problem. We just did.  So here's Colbert.  any segment Prescott Pharmaceuticals  Oh, you're probably too young to watch The Colbert Report.  Is that true?  You did right? There we go. One person knows what's going on. Okay.  So let's try a little problem here. You work at Prescott Pharmaceuticals and you're going to decide if this new drug works.  I won't tell you what it does yet k200 subjects.  You split them into treatment and controls face or half in each and you're going to measure weight changes. So hundred people will get a placebo sugar pill and a hundred people get this drug that's supposed to do something.  First thing let's set up some parameters.  Now in this problem, what were interested in is wait and we care mostly about the treatment group, right?  Unfortunately, there's also a control group. So there really two different worlds were studying what happens when you give these people a placebo and what happens when you give him the true drug and where I effectively sampling from both universes by creating a hundred people in both categories.  So like we did last class the easiest way to study. This is by looking at the difference of the two.  And understanding what it's distribution is now. I'm going to set up an old it says saying there's no difference between alternative just to show you how these problems look.  They probably designed the drug. So it had some goal in mind wraps weight loss.  Okay, so usually this would be one-sided but you could imagine that the drug actually increases weight plenty of people take things that increase weight usually cuz they're lifting in their gym bra.  Mass Gainer 3000 anyone take that  No.  Don't want to get huge.  Not really. Okay, we'll move on I was obsessed with gym stuff for a while in my life.  Okay. So here's what it really looks like in real life. You're never going to be told with the truth of the universe is  So usually what you decide is the least interesting thing I could ever get excited about if your drug decreases people's weights by 1 lb.  Is it worth it?  Is it a great weight loss drug and you like to Market it would you like to study to reveal the fact that it does at least one pound?  What is a 2lb sores a 20lb? Okay, so you have some number that you have to set locally?  Based on what's going on in your world and how important it is. Okay, maybe you won't work at the drug and less it can decrease weights by 7 lb. Like that's your number for whatever reasons. You said interesting that difference that you could ever care about. So, let's set it up is the number two for this problem.  Pay just to put a number on it.  So what you do is you go dry your two distributions, but this time they're separated by the difference of two. Okay, so it'd be really boring if the difference with 0 and I'd be excited by to now here's where it gets frustrating.  You know how to draw the normal curve because the null hypothesis says it Center should be zero in this problem.  The question is like where should you draw the alternative curve?  How can you see me doing it to the right here and sending it exactly two difference of two but we both have been excited about the other side also, right? What if it increases rates by 2?  Or decreases like it doesn't matter to us, right if it increases weight will Market is a way to get big at the gym and if it decreases weights, it'll be a weight loss drug.  It's perfect. No matter what happens. We can sell our drug to society. But when I drop the picture, I have to draw out on one of the two sides. It doesn't matter. What side you choose just choose one of them, okay.  So there we go. So I do it on the right hand side mostly cuz I wanted up nice numbers.  Okay, so  you assume the no and you believe you put on the spare blue glasses that have you interpreting the universe.  Now we want to understand how spread out these curves are. We know where they're centered be the hypotheses tell you that and at least interesting difference told us that now after work to figure out how spread out there. Are you have to remember the kind of calculations that go into what's going on. This is a difference of two independent populations a treatment in a control the last place. We saw that the spread out in us about Universe swimsuit packed a bunch of averages. What's the square root of the standard deviations in each  Square / their sample sizes added to each other  Oh Larry things on top of each other now getting complicated, right? Okay, so I put some numbers on here. You have to like go. Look who's up or figure out what happened in your study. Okay. So I just gave numbers 12 and where they knew there were 200 people. So in this case there was only one standard deviation given so you have no choice but to use it for both things just happen all the time. You don't have all the information you want. So you just use things all over the place. Sometimes you have to guess on what you're going to do, right? You haven't even collected any participants yet. So maybe go to the literature and you see like what's a reasonable spread out in this?  In the wee changes that happened in human beings when you give them drugs and placebos.  Okay, so as we get more complicated and have different settings you have to remember when I drop these normal curves here. What is the actual apparatus in the problem? Is it a one sample problem? Is it a two sample problem that we do through differences and so on?  Okay. Now when you have a two-sided alternative.  You work all that you get excited about averages that are way too low or way too high.  So these problems are actually going to have to rejection fences.  And if you have an alpha .05 if you're excited about the 5% strangest results than half of that would be low results in half would be high and that's how you find your to rejection fences in queso on the blue curve figure out where it's a nerd and how spread out it is. We did that.  And then say okay. I'd like to plow through almost all of the area through 97.5 plow plow plow plow plow, and I'd like to know the place beyond which there's 2.5% of the area of 3.32.  Now because this curve is centered at 0 I instantly know the other rejection princess the negative version if it weren't centered at 0 then you have to flip this answer across whatever the center of the curve is.  So here are two rejection fences if we get things way to lower way to hide the blue universe doesn't seem like a good place to live anymore.  Now when we go collect data, it don't come from the blue universe.  We just measure it's worth relative to the blue universe. So let me shade for you, but the red universe is doing this is the power.  So I shaded the red the area under the red curve.  It lives in the rejection region that you can see it clearly on the right hand side, but over here on the left.  I couldn't shade it because the curve is too low.  Gates are still sort of there.  And it will come into the calculation. It'll just be so worthless. So here I am doing calculations in our school. Are you want to move to any standard I settings right?  It can just deal with the fact that you're on some crazy curve. So I took 3.32 and I said head to the right but we're on the red curve which is centered at 2 with a certain standard deviation. And then I went from -3.32 and I had it left and you can see a little area there is it doesn't even have area in the first three decimal points.  The pretty worthless area but still part of the answer MK. So you add these together and you get a power of around 22%  this terrible  It means if your drug really has.  a difference of two  You better 22% chance that your studies going to find that and lead you to believing in that 78% of the time. You're going to keep thinking that your drug does nothing.  And the reason here is because you're trying to study something where there's not really that big of a difference 0 to 2.  And there's a lot of variability in the data.  If you go back and look at what kind of standard deviations are going on, you can see there's a lot of craziness and what happens when you give people drugs and you see what kind of weight changes they undergo.  I can have really big swings both ways. So it's very hard with only a hundred people to sort out. What's truly going on here.  Okay, let's try some Socratic question.  Let's see how this goes. I'll probably just break the computer here.  What's have to call it a day?  We're Holding On by a thread.  I'll tell you this is one of the hardest topics in the course. It's very conceptually difficult. And then even after you get all the conceptual stuff.  How you actually go do these problems? It's difficult. There's a lot of steps.  Let's see if your intuition is good here. If a true fact exists.  What is if H1 is really true, then increasing the sample size will increase the power.  Okay, look at that.  50/50 is random guessing. So we're 6% above random guessing.  How to get this right you really have to think too deeply for a second. Maybe this is a hard thing to figure out you come back to a picture like this and you say what's affecting the shapes of these curves here welder Center their means is dictated by null hypothesis and  smallest differences that you care about but they're spread out in this is this formula right here standard deviation of the square root of n  so then gets bigger. It makes those standard deviations smaller. So these curves get skinnier. So imagine in your head things are getting skinnier.  Does the blue curve get skinnier it pulls the rejection fence over to the left?  And if the red curve get skinnier more of its area will be to the right side of the rejection fence. So that's why the power gets bigger.  another hard one  we should get the power of a study is close to 1.  So we can almost always find a true fact if it's there.  It's so fun every time.  I never learned how to redo 50/50 guessing.  You can get the power closer and closer to one just increase the sample size forever right have a billion people in their study up a trillion people in your study.  But it's a very short-sighted way to think about things. All you're trying to do is control one of the influences. There's many other influences that are present that you have to be honest about Lacoste Frozen and risk going to give everyone in the world. You knew drug and Kill Them All  Guess what you figure it out? It doesn't work.  Hundred percent certain about that. Okay, we got to stop there a couple more slides that are really important about finding sample size that you want to look at. Have a nice week.  sandiego.edu "
