    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Welcome back beautiful Friday.  You'll never hear on gradescope that only 175 of you have turned in homework one at this point or reminder. That is due tonight.  I do not want to wake up to desperate email Saturday morning about inadequacy because I know you were adequate and can get it done. So get it done.  Okay.  We move on it's a big day.  So today we're going to lay the groundwork for all that is to come and we're going to do what's called probability Theory  When you study statistics, you'll notice that they're all sorts of random things that underpins statistical ideas and processes and probability is the study of Randomness. Now the cool thing is you've been using it for a lot of your life. Maybe just didn't realize all the different ways that it showed up. So I took a couple here.  Some little feel very familiar 50/50 chance that's making a probabilistic claim about How likely a coin is to come up with a certain side showing like heads.  Other things 30% chance of surviving when you get some diagnosis of stage stage 1 or stage 2 cancer, depending on what kind and finally there's another one. I took this picture in the morning of the election.  538 is a date of Journalism website. They do some of the best reporting around and they are some of the most intelligent Quan people that exist. So if you looked at the New York Times you have Hillary with a 95 or 99% chance of winning. But if you go to people that know their Quan stuff a little better than numbers look a little different so immediately you can see the chance of someone winning depends on how good and how smart the people are who are making the probabilistic Gods  Name something you should feel different about all these.  so for example  You probably think there's a 50 50% chance of getting heads.  Because you flipped lots of coins in about half of come up heads, right? So it's a repeatable kind of action. But this the election is a non-repeatable thing that happens once and you can't do it again with the same people with the same boaters with the same mindsets.  So take non-repeatable thing, but you still somehow put a probability on it.  So you can see they're actually going to be different kinds of probability. So we're going to divide them into three main categories.  And you can take entire classes on each one but first empirical so empirical you don't really know this word yet. It just means Based on data.  So if something is empirically probable or is empirical probability it's because you tried this thing over and over and collected lots of data, for example, you flipped a coin ten thousand times and roughly half of them came up heads and that's how you were assigning probabilities to things.  You can contrast that with theoretical probability. So here you're not going to do something lots and lots of times you're going to build a mathematical or theoretical model for it. And then you're going to start a study that model and what does it say about whatever it is you're excited about. So last time I checked a coin has two sides.  One of them might be called heads and that might be what you're excited about. So maybe don't think 50% you think 1 / 2.  And I don't need to flip that coin a bunch in order to decide you can do the same thing with dice in this example, then there's the last category.  sister dirtiest  subjective probability. So you have something that you can't repeat so campy empirical and you have something that you have no way of putting a good mathematical model on. So, what do you do you talk to your soul and you feel at it?  What's your chance of getting an A in this class? Well, we can't repeat that right? Cuz every time we try you were different human being than you were the first time through and I don't have the model that cuz it's super complicated. So, how about we just feel at it pick your number in your soul.  Somehow you did it, right your soul can just do some sort of internal hidden calculus that's subjective and depends on the subject you okay? So anyhow, this is the last one now. This is the one who study the least because there's not really much to say cuz it's all some hidden calculus in your soul and it differs from person to person. So we'll focus mostly on the first two  because he's there more easily defined. Go ahead.  Louder, please.  Which one would be this?  the one on the right  so that's a great question. Which one is 538 using do they just ask all their employees to emotionally guess know what they do is they take tons and tons of data.  About pulling some State polling some national polling and they run millions of simulations, you know, so maybe like in some poll 53% of Michigan doctors say they're going to vote for Hillary Clinton, but there's some variability in that right? So the lights set up some models. So it's a mixture sort of a model based approach but also an empirical approach that you do things over and over you can actually go read the entire methodology if you want, it's super complicated very nice question saying also,  Search truly I got some mixture of all of them. Okay, does it make sense to do something over and over and just look at your data and call that a day? Is that a way to do things so it only makes sense?  If as you collect more and more data the message you're getting from them converges to something.  So for example, here's me doing a little experiment. I'm going to flip a bunch of coins or the same one over and over if you like that and I can record what side I get as I do this and I can keep a running tally of all the data just keep talking on the new result over and over. So I started with heads and then we got heads and tails and then heads Tails tails and if you have a running tally you can look at what percentage of the flip so far have come up heads.  And you'll notice it's very crazy at first a hundred percent cuz you only slept at once but then as you do more and more you're hoping that this big long list will have about 50%  and if it does converge to some number that's how heavy the coin is and that your empirical Based on data probability.  Okay, here's another example will roll a die the singular of dice.  And was rolling over and over so die has six sides. They're all equally likely to come up on most it die Dice and you can say what the probability of getting a 4 so here I am rolling it more and more times and this axis is what percentage of those rolls so far have come up with a face for showing  So ideally in this picture you would like to see the visualization converge.  On some horizontal line. So you would like to have a horizontal asymptote in the mathematical language. And if it does that's great because 166 or 1/6 is the number you would have signed to the probability of getting a 4 if a graph doesn't converging just as crazy nonsense then collecting lots of data is invaluable to you cuz they don't tend to send a constant message as you collect more and more they don't converge on a message but luckily.  The day to do converging this is called the law of large numbers large innocence. If you collect tons of data law in the census is always true that if you do a random process over and over.  The proportion of times that some event is showing up like rolling a 4 getting a heads.  Will converge to some nice number and that's the number you end up assigning.  Probabilistically to that event. Whatever it is you care about this kind of cool. Now, it's quite difficult to prove the law of large numbers usually do this in graduate school if you're a statistician  And there's all sorts of different variations of the law of large numbers. You need to like very precise way of stating what's going on here. You need entirely theoretical underpinning basically, but for us we'll just accepted for now and it's an exciting exciting thing that you probably believe.  And later, if you want you can go prove it. Now. The problem is as soon as you see this and this isn't almost everybody Soul actually already as soon as you see it.  It's possible to corrupt it in a road it an abused it and this is often known as the gambler's fallacy. When you go abused a large numbers case of the gambler's fallacy something that's false. First of all has the name of suggest but basically what it says is  I know that if I collect more data, I'm supposed to sort of converged to something but the Gambler thinks that convergence should happen pretty soon or in the short-term. But the law of large numbers says that it happens in the long-term. You have to collect maybe millions of data points are billions. Okay. So here's some examples that I've actually even though this is what I do for a living it's still so tempting your soul wants to do it badly. Okay. So I used to do a lot of professional Blackjack stuff. So if you lose three hands in a row, you might have this feeling like I'm going to win the next one. How can I possibly lose the next one? I've lost so many I'm due for a win, right?  Will you are due for a win?  Just not in the short-term. It might take a million hands before you start winning again.  Okay, I do the second one every time I drive home had a lot of red lights you get angry, right?  You feel like you're due for a green one while you are just not soon just over the next hundred years. You'll hit a certain proportion of green lights. So don't think that the reconciliation of bad friends has to happen in the short-term. It just happens in the long term.  Okay. Now that's empirical probability. Basically, those are all the important things to think about now. It's time for the theoretical probability. So the first thing we're going to do is lay down some words vocabulary and I think it's easiest there across the top here in red easiest just to see them in settings instead of riding big long sentence is about what everything is so we'll take three different settings here. Easy ones that coins and cards because he's truly are nice random things that everyone knows about  It's very dangerous to pick other settings because we have a room of 270 people all who have different experiences and maybe you don't know about snowboarding tricks like I do so, maybe that's not the great example to choose. So that's why everyone uses coins in bags of balls and other nonsense that no one cares about  Okay, so we have these different settings.  First thing a trial this is the fundamental idea of probability should be able to do something that results in a random outcome.  So flipping a coin, for example, you have no idea what's going to happen when you flip it.  Okay, so she feel random drawing a card at random from a deck of cards. I've no idea what's going to happen. And finally this last one is most complicated cuz I wanted to show you it can get fancier. Why don't we go talk to three people and ask them if they use Facebook so  I don't know what's going to happen. But what's interesting here is I'm talking to three people at once.  So it's sort of a glued together dated unit. They were getting back.  Hey, so there's the first thing to trial generates random data outcome is something that could be created.  From this random action. So for example heads or particular card that might be exciting to you or you might be excited about yes. Yes. No, do you are you on Facebook?  No, no, no. No. Yes, we didn't get what I wanted. I was very excited about the outcome. Yes. Yes. No, but it didn't happen.  Okay now the event.  This is what you're most excited about seeing it's what you want to study.  And it is a collection or set of outcomes that excite you.  So sometimes it's just a single outcome.  like tails  Sometimes the event includes a bunch of outcomes like if you were excited by drawing a spade, there are 13 Spades in a deck of cards. So this event has 13 things in it.  Okay, and maybe hear your event is just a boring thing. Just one of the possible outcomes I yes. Yes. Yes that's amazing that you out of those three people said no.  I'm stunned this never happens.  Okay, the final thing is called the sample space. This is just a list of everything that could possibly occur when you do this random event.  So it is part of the universal set if you taken some set ideas before so coin can only give heads or tails unless you believe it could actually land on its side.  If you do believe that then you can put that in your outcome list and now it's not 50/50 anymore big mess. Now any of the 52 cards and hear with interesting in this?  Is it hard to list the sample space? First of all, every possible outcome includes three letters. Not one.  And you'll notice that there are things here. You might think there's two should be 6 cuz every person has two possibilities. The question is do I do 2 + 2 + 2 or do I do 2 x 2 x 2 well, if you just look at my list here you can see the rate things. So apparently I need to be multiplying and I'm sort of combining a bunch of things together.  Okay for some people to intuitive for some it's not.  So there we are now one way to look at this is the following an outcome is a single idea.  At The Other Extreme is the complete list of ideas in an event is somewhere sort of in-between from the single idea all the way up to the macro.  And if the event is really boring, it's just a single idea the event could also be the whole sample space. I just want something to occur in life and I'll get excited.  Maybe that doesn't do anything for you. Maybe that's a stupid event. Okay, usually an event is sort of in between the two extremes like there a couple things about which I'm excited.  So what are some problems once we've Define probability? This is the key definition that everything in probability theory is based on so if you have some sort of trial that can result in a bunch of different outcomes that are summarized in the sample space and if they're all equally likely this is super important right here.  Then if there's an event you want to study.  Call a to figure out how likely a is to occur. All you have to do is see how many things are in the event a how many outcomes are in it and divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.  Now there's some things baked into this. You may not realize first of all.  This definition is only going to help us if there are finitely many things in the sample space because that way your denominator is a finite number if there are infinitely many things. How do you divide by Infinity?  Here's the other thing that's really important is equally likely if your things aren't equally likely then it doesn't really make sense to use this. For example, what's the probability I get a hole-in-one the next time I go play some golf hole you can say 50% either you do or you don't  But this is stupid right because they're not equally likely.  I mean, yes, it's true either. I will or I won't but the chance that I will is so tiny compared to that. I won't.  So only when they're equally likely can you just do this numerator divided by denominator idea?  Okay, there's the definition of a few things that sort of come out of this first. Your probability is always going to be a real number between zero and one because the sample space always has more things or an equal amount of things to an event sample space is the biggest possible thing. So it's got to overwhelm the numerator. Okay. Now the event things in it, I'm not excited about anything in life.  The probability life gives me something I'm excited about 0.  Okay. The other thing is if you're a person that's been using percentages your whole life to talk about probabilities. And you say things like there's a 50% chance the coin comes up heads. Well with this definition you can now transition and start using decimals.  Sounds like a good idea to me. So let's try to transition and start using decimals for everything.  Because I know you can do the percentages stuff.  Okay. So let's have some problems. I'll do the first one and show you how to do these well.  So there's not a thought the garbage and put a system in place that will take you forward so you can do really hard problems.  Find the probability of rolling a prime number on a standard six-sided die.  Kevin is a standard that means it's numbered one through six instead of some other weird number and and it also means it's fair. So all sides are equally likely to come up. Remember the read text from the previous slide. There we go. So we've met that night. Remember to prime number is  The first thing you should always do is Define an event in words. This will help you localize what the problem is actually asking about in addition. You should use a capital letter for your events. This is a convention that everyone follows. So now if I see a capital letter on your page, I instantly no other probably defining an event.  It doesn't matter. What letter you choose. I chose a here cuz the alphabet in America. There you go.  Now you could also tell me what's in a if you wanted to hear the prime numbers that could appear on a die. 1 is not a prime number by definition if you take abstract algebra, and you learn about units of  Groups in algebra has rings and all this Fields. You'll understand why it's not good to to find one is prime.  Anyhow that's later in life. If you become a mathematician, so there are the prime numbers and then the next thing you can do is to find what's in the sample space that's easy here and then you can just go divide the sizes of those two and you'll see my malady is a 1/2 5 or 50% event on a standard die.  Not too hard, right what's key here is I defined an event in words. I listed everything that was in it if that's possible. I listed the entire sample space if it's possible and then I use a simple division so you can see how this will get a lot more complicated. All I have to do is make things were it's really hard to figure out how many things are in a or an S. I can't make the division hard until I make the denominator Infinity.  Which is later.  Let's see how you do.  flip a coin three times  find the probability of getting exactly two heads. Good luck. One minute with Pusher speed.  Okay, that's what one minute feels like.  Did your soul have an intuition about this?  What do you think?  You got 3/8. How'd you get 3/8?  so hot  stop stop stop. I know nothing about disjoint events.  And you're also not to finding your event. You're not listing the things you're not listing the sample space you're using this like weird mixture of all these different ideas and you have the right answer but I don't care but I care is about a systematic way of doing this the transitions to higher-level problems.  So right now we're just eliminating sample space and you can put a box around the things that are true, but I loved in your answers you right there are three different spots where that Tails could go and the heads are in the remaining spots. That's a brilliant idea. I love it.  so you got the right answer here 3 8  so this is really important which has happened. What you need in life is not a technique that gives you right answers because that can be incredibly flawed and not transition to higher-level things. You need a technique that has a robustness and a strength to it. So it's a tool you can take the higher-level things. That's what you always want to be doing with your life. Who cares about right answers that's just a reflection of the accuracy of the current tools.  What you want tools that can do almost anything and have power to them. Okay. Now, why would you do this empirically we just did this theoretically right? So the empirical answer is a big hot mess. So what you have to do is flip three coins and decide whether you got the correct event or not.  If you did just say the word. Yes, if you didn't you'll say no, then you have to repeat that again. Maybe do it yourself again or have a different person flip three coins and no say yes or no, and if you do this many many times and then look at the percentage of people that said, yes, so this requires tons of coins and cornerstones of time.  No one has time for that, right?  Okay, let's do another one.  Again, can you develop a framework that has the power to answer harder questions?  Okay, there's two minutes again. Do you have a way to present things they can convince other people that can convince yourself? I'd people saying and my right eye people saying am I right and they had nothing written anywhere. But what am I supposed to do? Like you have to communicate your ideas? It's not just getting the right answer. I don't care so I can figure out how do I represent a possible outcome?  If you're just getting one thing out, then just letters or numbers can represent things like we saw earlier with h and T for example, but if your data consists of gluing together a bunch of pieces, like asking three people about Facebook, then we had to use like a glued together or concatenated computer science people idea. So here why don't I use an ordered pair? We haven't seen that presentation yet. Now the dice to you may feel indistinguishable. Okay? Well, I don't know which one is the first in which one is the second but you could always and label them right for the number one on one of the dice and the number two on the other and then act like they're different things if you want and if you act like they're different things than keep track of that through the whole problem. Okay. So all I care about is the D one is greater than or equal to. So here's something interesting for people for whom English is not your first language this stupid phrase at least may not be the most common thing for you.  Okay, I don't know in German which is my second language with the appropriate thing is for the idea of at least so I could see how this would be difficult. So you have to memorize word cues and how they translate into mathematical things.  D1 greater than equal D2 you can list the whole sample space notice. I'm still giving you kind gentle things that have a finite number now. I chose 16 here because I know it's right on the verge of what people are willing to do.  Did you have that moment or like going to list them all or not?  You had that moment, right if they chose that moment you'd have that feeling. So we're going to quickly get two things where you can't list everything in the denominator. And then my Approach right now is going to fall apart and your approach from earlier is going to seem so really  that's the limitation of my current tool in requires roughly on a delineation or least ability to count. So here you can see me boxing the event we care about. Those are where the first spot II and you get 10 sixteenths or 5/8. So now you can see my picture 9/16. What did you leave out?  One, one end and messy trivial case.  You added wrong 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.  Okay. Now you should reduce things. Okay. I don't need a decimal for this sometimes a decimal will help if the numbers very weird, but I roughly know what 5/8 is emotionally. I know it's about 62.5% or something close, right? So if you have some weird number, sometimes it helps.  Okay now.  A couple of additional ideas. The first thing is if the event can never occur.  Then it will have probability zero.  Will have to later fix that.  But currently it will have probability 0 and if the event must occur then we'll have probability one. That's the only way to know that something must occur is if the event.  Is the most boring event possible I'd love for anything to happen will guess what something will happen. You have a 100% chance of seeing the thing you're excited about.  Okay, next time we should Define the complement. So anytime you have an event. It's a collection of outcomes. So the compliment is just all the other outcomes that you're currently not excited about. This is in relation to the sample space. So you have to know what the sample space is in order to find the complement of a particular event.  Cuz you to look outside yourself, you stuff to know what Universe you are bound by and one thing is cool is that the complement in the event will have this relationship would probably be complicated compliment occurs. It's just one minus the probability that the event occurs will see why that is in a moment visually, so you're really convinced.  Okay, so here's an example if you care about and even numbers on a die, then the complement is the probability of not an even number.  Now I chose something easy cuz you know how to take not even and turn it into odd. It gets a lot more complicated if I say not prime or not divisible by 3.  Or something even more nefarious. So you see will have to take compliments or not of things like using Venn diagrams to understand this so you can start by saying what's wrong with sample space is this rectangular square and looks like the idea of probability over to area. So the sample space could be thought of as the most boring event ever I think something to occur. So that should have area or probability one and then you could represent an event is just some circle or shape. Okay doesn't have to be a circle. You could use triangles for your Venn diagrams break convention.  I'll let you do that in your own time. So then the complement of a is just everything outside the circle so it's all the remaining stuff but it's constrained by the box which is why you need to know the sample space to figure out the complement and now you can see why the rule that the probability of a complement is 1 - 2 probability of the event cuz stuff has to add up in pictures right additive areas of pictures dictate.  Okay, but else but if we have two events, let's get fancier.  Tell me some vents when I draw them may not be overlapping.  Usually we use the word not overlap to suggest things don't overlap in probability Theory use the word disjoint to say that the events don't overlap or if you thought about them assets. They would have no common outcomes.  They have to be describing different kinds of outcomes.  So if you want to find the probability that the event a or the event B happens now you're excited about either of these two things occurring it turns out that you can show that it's just the sum of the probabilities.  But this rule is only true if the events are disjoint. We will fix this Rule and make it better.  later in class for non disjoint events  So let's try a little quick example here. This won't be too rough.  So someone says I'm going to flip a coin five times and you know what I'm excited about.  Either getting 5 heads the heads of experience or one tail exactly. I'd be excited about either of those two events.  Now if you want it could be thought of his one giant event. But here we're going to think about it is to separate things and hopefully we'll be disjoint so we can deal with her probability. So here's me putting words to the event. This is mostly a communicative saying about your solution. You're helping the reader focus on what really matters. Yes. It's written in the problem. Right? But as you move higher mathematics your focus and life more generally should be on effective communication of ideas. Not just right answers.  Okay. So there we go. I chose A&B alphabetical you can break things. If you don't like alphabetical Trends now you can list since we're flipping it five times and that's sort of the trial has a big unit. Then our outcomes look like concatenated or glued together strings of letters that were excited about so you can see the five heads and you can see the one tail which unfortunately can be created in so many different ways. Look at all the spots that you can put the key in the rest must be heads cuz there's exactly 1 tail.  Now these two events are disjoint. You can look at them and just notice there no elements in common between the two sets.  Okay, the second set always has exactly one t in the first set has zero T's that's how I know. There's just joint.  Now this problem is probably at a spot where almost no one in the room would want to list all of the outcomes 32 too many for you.  I hope it's too many.  Do you want to want to waste your life doing inefficient things? You have to figure out how big the sample space is. Remember when I said 2 x 2 x 2 earlier about the Facebook data?  Well, we the same situation here each of these spots the first spot in the list could either be an HRT and the next one could be in a charity and so on so they all have two possibilities you end up multiplying all those tools together not adding.  So that's how we get our 32 and so now to find P of a or b.  We're just going to add P of a separately from POV and luckily those each individually or easy to find 1/32 + 5/32.  And we get 316 another reason I do this example is because the answer is starting to get dirty.  And one of the hard things about probability theory is the answers can be disasters.  27 / 1023 things that you're never going to guess.  And that's one of the cool things. I also think about probability theory that I like this somebody counterintuitive answers that show up. So don't be afraid of a big hot mess of an answer one because I suggested into because I'm going to give you things for which the answer is a big hot mess so that I can a road.  Part of the social contract you have with mathematics in your head you and Mathematics have this relationship. It's been changing over the years but it started as oh, you're just going to give me nice integer answers 5601. Isn't that how it all started in 5th and 6th grade?  And then by 10th or 11th grade you like? Okay. I'll let you give me like the square root of 10.  Maybe 5 + \u221a 10, but I'm really worried that that's an answer, but I'll let you give it to me. Well eroded a little more and accept hot messages answers and don't be afraid of their whiteness.  Because they could definitely be right.  Okay.  Let's try another little important idea here. I like this one.  if you are a set theory person  it is totally fine. If you want to use this notation a intersect B is the empty set.  That's one way to show to tell me that events are disjoint use the set notation. You can also just use words A and B are disjoint. I'm happy with that. If you don't like all this set theory stuff examples here. I'll give you some disjoint things rolling an even number on a die, or maybe you're excited about a 5. Well guess what 5 a.m. Even  in most mathematical systems  Maybe you're excited about red or green or you could get excited about blue or orange, but there's no overlap in those colors.  I guess unless you have certain kinds of color blindness.  Interesting. Anyway, the most important here is any event will be disjoint with its complement now over on the right. We have some non disjoint that is there is a join that is when you put them together there's an overlap and that's the join so not disjoint. Unfortunately is the word we have to use tastes a little bad. So give me an example of something that can be for the first one handed be daring.  Go ahead 16 is 16 on a die.  Or it's 4 on a die.  Are you thinking of a standard six-sided die numbered 1 through 6?  Okay, I guess you are so if you're thinking about the standard dye you can say for standard, okay?  Go ahead.  Harvard Harvard Harvard Harvard an Ivy League school and an s s I live like a few minutes from it for a lot of my life NFL football and MLB baseball.  You got this to?  Bo Jackson you guys know who that is.  Can you give a more recent example?  Go ahead.  Deion Sanders, you know who that is.  Can you give him more recent example?  You got one?  I don't know who that is.  Would you would you be Tim Tebow? Should I count did he ever actually playing a true MLB game?  He did.  minor league  he never hit we're not counting them. So Deion Sanders or whatever. You said, I guess or the last example it can happen apparently.  Okay, next you got to add to 1 Rule now that you know disjoint events are if you take a sample space and you slice it up like a pie and breaking into lots of pieces.  Turn all the probabilities of the events. You just slice it up to add to 1 the pie always gets eaten, right and if you never eat more than the 100% of the pie and you never eat less than 100% of the pie. That's for sure. So, let's take a nice little easy gentle example where you might use this if you decided that it can only do one of four things in San Diego Sun clouds rain and snow.  And you're going to categorize every single day ever into one of those for labels mkii put some probabilities on those based on my experience living here for so many years. You could then go figure out the probability of a snowy day here. It depends on the fact that you completely partitioned the sample space into disjoint cookies.  And they make up the totality of the sample space. So when you add them all up, you have to get the entire Pie as it were.  So if you want to know the probability of snowing issue just have to know the other three any three will give you the 4th given the fact that they all add up to one. So here 1%  Set feel right.  Depends on how West vs. East Coast you are.  Turn up the coast. But do you live near the coast or not? Those people in like Julian in Jamul see a lot more snow than we do over here in La Jolla the jewel La Jolla.  Okay. Now it's time for the hardest word becomes up in relation to events.  So this is known as Independence.  So first, I'll just give you the rule. This could also be the definition of what the word independence means events are going to be said to be independent.  If when you try to find the probability that both occur.  It turns out to just be the probability of a times the probability of B. That's one way to define independence. You can check if two events are independent by checking this Criterion.  That's not how I'd like to define independence because it's just some stupid mathematical formulas no intuition. But here's how you can think about it intuitively. We use the word independent in relation to our government. We have these three branches. They're supposed to be independent of one another  And you say what? What does it mean for the executive to be independent of the Judiciary?  Will it means whatever the executive thinks and wants and has decided.  Maybe they want to ban transgender people from the military site.  When you go ask the Judiciary what they think the answer they gave should have nothing to do with what the executive has decided. They can look over and say all of the executive wants to do something and we're going to decide what's actually going on irrespective.  What's going on in the executive? And the same thing is true of events if you're going to try to decide if they're independent or not.  You just say if I know one of them is a curd. It shouldn't influence how I feel about the other one.  So let's put some intuition on this so over here are some dependent event examples and here's some independent ones.  Okay, so let's start. There's a random person behind the curtain.  I'd like you to put some numbers on things for me. Okay, first what's the probability that a random person you can't see will get in to some college any college.  Give me a number.  Pointer. Okay 20% chance of rain in person gets in the college was just agree with it, whether it's true or not. Okay. Now we're going to play the game again, but I'm going to give you some information the random person behind the curtain they got into Harvard.  Now, what's the probably don't get into any college?  It's one very got into Harvard, right you're not worried about their college readiness anymore. You know, it's been a certain 2 by Javed cuz of these events influenced as soon as you know, what one of the event says if it happens, you know, what's going on with the other getting a red card on the top of the deck getting red car is the second card in the deck.  Okay, if I ask you about the second card in the deck and I say what's the probability it's red.  But will you tell me?  I got a deck without the second card.  I really tried 1/2.  Yes, there's a card on top of it. I don't care. I don't know anything about it.  Now what happens if I tell you this hot card is actually read and now I ask you about the second card. Do you still feel it's 1/2?  Or have I changed your emotional feelings and now your answer depends.  On the fact that the top on this red if you know the top one is red. There's one less red one for the second card to be right. There's only 12 23-25 in the deck at 2:52 if that's your standard deck so your answer key independent and dependent events.  Person is behind the curtain. I asked you there chance of getting into Harvard. What do you say about the person? What's your chance of getting a random person's chance of getting into Harvard.  What?  .5.  .25%  That's very small. Okay. Now I'm going to flip a coin it came up heads.  What's the chance to get into Harvard?  25 and your answer is independent of what I just told you. It's no relation that knowledge didn't change your beliefs and what's going on, right? Cuz ideally coins don't dictate who gets into college or not. But if it were the Harvard admissions coin  tails is reject heads is not okay. Anyhow, so this is what Independence Events are and we're going to develop more mathematics around them.  In the future. We have one more minute. I'm using it.  Let's take these two things a person uses Facebook a person uses Twitter.  Again, if you wanted to sign if they're just joined you just play a game. Is there anyone in the world on both?  Are you on both?  No, but maybe there's no one. Is there anyone on both?  You are okay great. So they're not disjoint it can happen.  That's all you do you play this game? Can anyone be in both sets. Now? If you want to know if they're independent you play the game. We were just playing the side with the probability is someone uses Facebook come up with your number.  I don't know what it is. It's something right 80% 60%  then let's play the game again. But this time suppose, you know that b is true, you know, the person is on Twitter. You can see their Twitter account. Does it change your belief in their presents on Facebook if it changes your belief the answers their vents depend on one another the influence one another if it doesn't change your beliefs or independent.  In this case, the things are dependent. If you know someone's on Twitter, they're definitely going to be on Facebook is Twitter's though.  The Lesser good one, right?  If they're willing to stoop to Twitter of course will be on face not that's okay. I'll see you guys.  Have a good one.  Can you see San Diego podcast? "
