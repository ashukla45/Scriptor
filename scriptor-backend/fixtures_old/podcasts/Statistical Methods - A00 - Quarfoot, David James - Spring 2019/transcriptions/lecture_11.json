    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast everyone.  I want to start by saying how proud I am of this class. I think you've had some very tough homework problem. So far this quarter if your home works have been pushing you and I really appreciate the effort I see going on. I think it's amazing that you really grow, and that's how you get yourself ready for graduate school. If you want to go or the real world if you want to go and solve really hard things that don't justify computer problems. So leave the cookie cutters behind it's time to think deeply about things in life, and I appreciate you doing that and working with me on that. Thank you.  Okay, it's time to move forward. I love this topic. I think things got me most excited about statistics was this kind of stuff right here.  That I finally have the ability to model things from The Real World now the problem.  Right now is that when it comes to continuous random variables all you know where some really contrived things some things I give you the model for any might Sable what's going to happen most of the time that would be nice. Why don't I just learned a small set of things that show up a time. So this for example right here was our iodine concentration problem. I just gave you the model, you know, so where did I come up with that? And is this the kind of thing that shows up a lot and maybe I should learn about so we're going to start by talking about the common things. Now, the easiest one to start with is known as the uniform distribution suggested in discrete random variables, you had to go to memorize a bunch of common ones.  Same overall logic applies here with continuous. So anytime you have some kind of setting.  Where are there a finite Zona possibilities so now it's not a list to smooth the interval of possibilities cuz the continuous and if they're all equally likely then this would be modeled using the uniform distribution. So the last example we had at the end of last class was one of these I fix the spinner we measured the angle from East and basically anything could have come up equally likely cuz there's a million variables to decide where the flicker actually stops. You know, how hard I pushed it the wind in the room and so on so they make swerve everything equally likely to each other now, maybe say that super contrived who played spin-the-bottle anymore anyway, so effectively with that is right. So here's another one. Maybe you go to the bus stop every day at 8.  and  you're only going to wait 10 minutes at most given the busing structure but you never really know when the bus comes exactly your sort of sit there and basically all the times over the next 10 minutes or equally likely that could be a setting that could be uniform distribution. Also, I'll give you a nice one that all the Cs people in the room will know and love you use your little C plus plus or Java or something. Whatever your favorite language of the day is and you Generate random numbers and their sum function in there.  And I maybe it's best that things between zero and one and you've been using it under the assumption that everything was equally likely in case not heavily weighted to give you numbers closer to one more often or closer to zero.  So there is a nice example of a uniform distribution. How one does something like this in the computer is a complicated question.  And we can just tell you this in general. So let's just say the zone of possibilities maybe since you're the one but maybe it's a tabby and you can see that on the horizontal axis.  Okay. So here are the possible values you're going to spit out now How likely they are relative to each other is what the graph shows you and since the graph has a consistent height. It's just as likely to give you any value is it is any other value now because the height is 0 outside of a TB it can't give you those values.  Now when it comes to defining the density function, we just have to make sure it meets the two conditions one that the graph doesn't dip below the axis which visual you can see into the area under the sink has to be one something has to happen. That's what a hundred percent probability means basically. Okay. So this is a rectangle right here and you know, it's length is going to be B- a  To Justin to make sure the height is 1 / that so that when you multiply them you get an area of 1 and that's what you struggled with at the end of last class. I will awkward the first time you see it.  Okay. So here's the density function for any uniform distribution and you get to choose with A and B are two spins on the setting. So take the actual setting you're dealing with and math it over to what's possible.  Now this is a setting where you don't have to get fancy to find probabilities. You will call those are areas under the density curve because it's a simple shape.  Can you can use things from high school? For example, now testing your intuition what value do expect to get on average that is what is the expected value of this distribution?  Someone talk to us. Tell us your soul.  Go ahead.  You said the middle of A and B, and then you said b - A / 2.  Those two statements conflict with each other.  Although you may not think they do help fix this.  Never mind. What do you say?  Remind me Savor to is what he saying.  So now you want a + b - A / 2 K that's not correct. Is there a simple version?  Yeah.  Is it one? Okay. So one is right there. That's not even value you can get out so that doesn't make any sense.  Go ahead.  A + B / 2 also known as the midpoint rule from geometry. Yeah. Okay. So be mine has half the distance and when you added beat when you had it and it said let started and walk half a distance. Okay easy way.  Okay. The question is how does 1 / B - a map to that grass? Okay. All the Tappan is 1 - 3/8 is a constant. So to draw a horizontal line.  But I'm only doing the horizontal line between A and B. So I want to draw the horizontal line the whole way but I can  Okay, if the question is a physical to a don't have a problem, absolutely, but the point is you're trying to find things on an interval. So if you make a and b the same number, there's no more interval. So the model should fall apart, which is exactly what you're noticing which is nice.  Okay. So your intuition is right. The expected value on average should be a + b / 2. Okay. So just imagine this thing is spitting numbers out at you. Okay, and here are the numbers on the x-axis you can give any sort of spit some out. Okay. So imagine raindrops falling from this graph and wherever they hit the x axis is with the machine gives you the random variable. Okay half the time they're going to see it's going to be above the average and have time will be below and it doesn't rain anymore in any part of this graph than anywhere else on the graph because the height is the same throughout so there is the halfway point between A and B. So if your intuitions going to tell you that  Maybe you don't trust your intuition.  What why don't we go try to figure out what the result is by using algebra? So this is the definition of expected value take each possible value x and x identity which tells you roughly How likely it is.  Okay. Now I'm going to put what's going on in this problem. So for example, we don't need to go from negative Infinity to Infinity cuz most of the time there's no area going on cuz I had to zero so why don't we just go from A to B, which is the only place where the graph makes sense has become that X and f x I replace with 1 / B - A and you can move it to the front because it's a constant now you just have to integrate x which is 1/2 x squared.  And then we need to plug in the upper and lower bound now. I should be doing this emotionally. You should say.  How am I ever going to get a plus sign out of all of us there? No plus signed anywhere, but the expected value is A + B / 2.  Well, hopefully the algebra will save us and it will as soon as you plug in being a little notice. We create B squared minus a squared a difference of squares and when you factor such things.  They tend to create an expression like B- a * b + a + that's where the plus sign makes its first appearance.  And then everything else cancels basically and gives you what we were hoping for a + b / 2.  Your intuition was right you're so that's a good sign.  Now the question is what is your soul say about the variance or the standard deviation of spread out things are.  If your soul doesn't have a great answer for that, you know that things are between A and B. That's the whole Zone. But what sort of spread out in this. Does that give you?  So one thing you can do is go find the variance using or formula from the past. The other is to believe it when I tell you.  So turns out the variance is b - 8 squared / 12. So this should feel counterintuitive. Where does it's 12 come from? Well comes from some horrible step and some messy calculation.  Okay. Also, you should notice this is positive. So whatever I wrote there had to have the ability to always be positive and the swearing makes B minus a positive. So I'm feel good about that. You can take the square root and then you just get B- over Route 12.  So this is how spread out your experiences on a uniform distribution. You're going to land on average at a + b / 2 but they'll be some spread out in this to that and here it's very important to be we all think about is the number on the right side of the interval in a on the left so that this difference is positive because spreads must be positive. They can't be negative.  So I'll let you practice driving the variance and standard deviation at home.  They're not the most fun calculations. I'll tell you that.  Now, let's see. If you can use these tools now that we start to develop them. So let's go to Socrative and try a little it's been awhile.  How control the pacing?  We will let you see the question feedback in anonymize everything.  random number generator spits out things between 1 and 4  Soon they're all equally likely.  What is the height of the density function?  When it happens to be nonzero.  When it's actually interesting.  Okay, there's two thirds of the room.  Okay, we've got at least.  Most of the class getting 1/3 so you probably saw in the answer. Remember the density function has a fight one of her B- a so when you have lots of formula sisters to get all mixed up together.  Pastor another one. What's the probability you get back the number pi?  There we go. That's pretty good.  getting any value from continuous random variable probability 0  hey is so tempting you want to just put the height of the density function, but the density function height doesn't measure probability when you integrate underneath it. That's how you find probabilities.  Probability of getting the number is at least three.  Two-thirds of the room. Okay. What do I do? I draw a picture of the density. I put three in at least three means go to the right and I find the area of this little section here that has a base of 1 and a has a height of 1/3 that area is the probability so you multiply those and get 1/3  What value do we expect on average?  One thing you can do if you're bored after you answer you can sit there and try to think about what percent will get it, correct?  And this will help you distance yourself from your own understanding because they like what other people actually understand.  Okay, so this right here you should expect a very high results because all it is is plugging things into a formula which is the lowest level kind of skill. You can create in life some of the other things required actual conceptual understanding you understand understand on the previous problem. Like the density function has a certain height areas underneath their probabilities. You had to decode the statement into something about greater than 3 but this problem you just hit buttons on a calculator or pull out some formula from a formula sheet. So you should expect a really great answer. What is the standard deviation in the numbers being output?  Do you expect more people to get this correct in the last problem or less?  Okay slightly less maybe not an important difference, but now there's a variance and standard deviation. So maybe some people put things into the variance formula.  that's a  00 competing formulas. What's the probability it outputs an integer?  77% that's good. So the only integers are 1 2 3 and 4 in the zone we care about you try to find the area above those points to finding the area of 4 little line segments. Those have no area. They've a length if they don't have an area cuz their base is 0 to make it harder.  What's the probability of outputs an irrational number?  Now I should probably read in the little solution. It tells you this was quite difficult.  So you have to understand how the irrationals exist in the zone so like yeah, there's lots of irrational's right and there's lots of rationals. So I are the irrationals basically everywhere.  I did basically almost the same as the real number line or they very sparse in there and they don't appear very often like the last question was about the integers, right and they're so sparse with big spaces.  So if you take a real analysis class will eventually learn the few rationals are almost everything going on there and the rationals are very sparse and contribute almost nothing which is to say most numbers are irrational basically all of them.  So you should have expected yourself to get that right. I just wanted to show you that.  This is one reason you might want to take more math classes. So you can have a sense of be able to answer questions like that, but are very counterintuitive in very hard.  Okay, so there we go. Now you're good with uniform things. You're making progress there.  But that is that's a pretty trivial model. I'm guessing you'll probably believe so would be nice if we had some fancy or things in life. So let's move on to the next fanciest thing up the hierarchy of difficult and will return to an idea we had earlier with the soccer the Portland Timbers the scoring goals. And before we were excited about the goals, and I'd ask questions like to be two goals. Could it be 17 goals? Could there be zero goals  And in order to do this, I had infuriate idea and the raid idea had a time in the denominator. Maybe it was per soccer game.  Or could even be down 2 minutes or per season or something. So what we're going to do now is focus on the time instead the denominator ID instead of the numerator. Okay. So here we are in the past using for song to focus on the numerator which was a discreet idea goals. You can score 1 1/2 goals, but you can think about time is a continuous idea. She might say if I'm going to sit there and wait to see your goal.  How long are we going to have to wait before? We finally see our goal?  now this feels  a little pisani  because the setup requires some rate based idea.  But it's not as long as it focuses on the denominator this field a little geometric.  Because we are waiting until we get the first of something.  But it's not geometric because we're not doing a discreet idea like flipping a coin over and over and Counting how many trials we're moving through a smooth span of time. So it has both of those flavors. So try not to get confused by the overlap here. So anytime you want to model how long you have to wait in time not coin flips not some discreet idea for an event to occur when you know the rate on average at which these events occur.  This will always be the exponential distribution. So you should be looking for things like an average rate. You should be looking for a question about how long do you have to wait for some some q that you're measuring the time until the exciting event? And this is what you care about when you go to a sporting event, right like you're there to see goals.  And you just playing the waiting game which is like the horrible thing about going unless you enjoy like the non-scoring action in a sporting event, but I don't get excited about that. I'm incapable. For some reason you set up this Lambda idea. The cool thing. Is it set up the same way as it was for poisson. Okay, there's still the events are in the numerator in the time is in the denominator. So that hasn't changed. The only difference is now the model will focus on the denominator idea, which is time.  Okay. So here's a picture of what exponential distribution looks like.  So there's a lot going on here.  So the first thing is it has the name exponential distribution because the density function uses the function g in it now, it does not look like the exponential function.  Which goes up usually as you head from left to right unless the exponent has some negative coefficient. Okay, so you have to distinguish the exponential distribution from the function.  Okay. So this is Lambda * e to the negative 1/2 x so the support that is the values that this thing could actually take on this random variable is X greater than or equal to 0 so if you're waiting for something to happen, you can't wait for negative time.  Okay, you can see from the picture that this point right here is 0 Lambda. So it doesn't go up to infinity and it drops down which means waiting longer longer X is less likely that is things want to get resolved sooner rather than later according to this model. I doubt many people in this room have gone to a sporting event and waited 27 hours to see something exciting usually things happen within the first couple of minutes.  And that's what this is trying to say.  They say it's a picture and remember it's the horizontal axis that has the possible values for the random variable. Okay, so it's like this I'm going to go to a game. I'm going to wait wait, wait with my stopwatch and time. How long till the first goal maybe I get 4.7 minutes. Okay, that's like a little raindrop falling over here at 4.7.  That's what's going on. Now first thing you might wonder I just threw up some random crazy expression land a x e to the negative land backs. How could that possibly have area one under it?  I mean look, I didn't even tell you what Lando was to tell me this has Area 1 no matter what Lambda is that should feel counterintuitive.  But maybe by some miracle it does. So how do we figure this out while we go find the area under this curve? So here we need to go from 0 all the way to Infinity improper integral.  What do you now know and remember that we need to change this to a proper in a row by choosing your favorite letter of the alphabet and putting a limit that pushes that letter out toward Infinity. So basically going from 0 to n  You're going to find that area. The answer will involve an and then you got to pull in off to the right forever, which will effectively make you find the area from 0 to Infinity.  Does this feel familiar?  We did this very idea on Monday previewing. So the today wouldn't be so rough. What's difference a day is now I don't have the number five here for Lambda which we did on Monday. So there's another variable. So look at you. Look how fancy you become and I say this not in like a serious way is not like a joke X  Which is the horizontal axis idea?  You have Lambda which has a fixed thing. You just don't know it or it's not specified.  You have e-juice another letter, but that's holding a constant that we know 2.71828 ish?  Can you have a variable and which is like helping the improper integral this?  She made it up to a lot of letters of the alphabet. You should feel proud of that. It's a measure somehow your sophistication at this point. Okay, so now we need to take the antiderivative. So I need to be negative x with a Lambda on there and you can believe me by taking the derivative chain rule. If you did take the derivative would spit out an extra negative Lambda that would combine with a negative in front to make the positive Lambda. You see right there.  Now we need to plug in the upper Bound in the lower bound. They go in Forex this could complicated cuz you're so many letters going on, right?  So now we have e to the negative lamb to end when you plug in zero you is getting one this negative sign was it this one right here, which I moved out in front of the limit.  Now is n goes to Infinity.  Negative Lambda times and goes to negative Infinity.  I needed a negative Infinity is zero. So that expression is going to vanish and we're just going to get a negative combined with a negative one which equals one. So apparently we've rigged this function this density function in such a way that regardless of what Lambda is we could area one and it's another important thing to just happen. I made an assumption.  The Lambda was positive.  And the reason I was important if land is positive and is going to positive Infinity. Then this exponent go to negative Infinity, which is what I need. So what this says if you want to use this infrastructure, you can have a negative Lambda. You can't score -3 goals per game.  Now if you ever do have a negative rate idea like I'm losing two pounds per day on my diet.  You can you don't have to say I'm gaining -2 pounds. You can just rephrase it in a positive way. Like I did naturally I'm losing too.  Put some negatives in there or the negatives are built into the words or your interpretation around the number so you can always turn negative into positive. So let's try an example here. I've recently bought a new dishwasher and that's what made me think of this.  I know you don't get excited about dishwashers. But one reason I chose this just because a lot of electronics follow exponential distributions if what you're majoring about them is how long you have to wait before they break.  And that's not obvious at all why they would follow that model.  Maybe you believe like things tend to break earlier rather than later in life. When does anyone in the room have a cell phone? That is more than 8 years old.  They tend to break in 1 2 3 4 years rather than 15 16 17 years. So that's one reason you might believe that these things follow an exponential distribution. So, you know that dishwasher break on this certain schedule on average you get a break down every 5 years.  Case of the promise to give you that information that setting up Lambda for us. Okay. So then you ask him question. What's the probability it will last at least eight years without a breakdown?  You might wonder about this. Could you make it eight years without having to replace the stupid thing. So first thing you want to do is set up the random variable so you can use in words and symbols.  And most importantly now are the parameters that feed all of this. So I took this phrase break down once every five years. I said, what's the time idea? Here's that's in the denominator. What's the discrete thing that were measuring or waiting for a hoping? That's a breakdown and that goes in the numerator.  Okay. So now we set up Lambda.  Next thing set up your random variable here. I doing in symbols and words at the same time x is an exponential distribution based on the number one fifth and it's counting the amount of time you get to wait until your dishwasher breaks down. Okay, so you can imagine a little box here on the side of his exponential land equals 1 over 5 as a button and I hit it and it spits out the number 7.2 and guess what your dishwasher is going to last 7.2 years. I'm going to hit it again 13.7 you were one of the lucky ones. The density function did not want to give such a big number.  But you got you locked out.  Can you just keep hitting it and will give you all dishwasher breakdown X that's what this thing X is doing it spitting out that number.  Okay, finally went to have all that set up. Do you code with a problem actually cares about so you can do a lot better in this class if you read this end. So a partition it up. I just got to be a lot of statements to help me set up a random variable and then separately there a lot of statements. What do you want to do with it once it's set up and don't do it all at once. Okay. I didn't even really need to read the last Clause here after the, to do anything so far. It's all irrelevant. So now the question is I just want to break down time to be greater than or equal to 8.  And that's where we are with this problem. Let's see. If you can do it. I'll get you going you can push the symbols for me.  b20b problem  Okay, so if you have Infinity written is the bound of an evaluation bar, you will lose half a point on the example. I guarantee that right now.  I want you to practice a little more writing these improper integrals as proper using limit notation. Okay, so push-push-push. So a lot of people are still having trouble with this auntie differentiation step. You'll get used to this after you do it a few more times. This one's a little wacky. Okay. So what happened? I got .20 to you can leave your answers exact if you want you can rounded to three decimal places on exams. Both are fine. Both bring value exact things have not been rounded that's their value rounded things. Now, I know 20% is roughly the number were talking about here now, some people got clever and they said I don't want to do without Infinity thing and they did the complementary probability.  That is they found the area from 0 to 8. Nice gentle kind bounce and then they subtracted their answer from one. You can do it that way. Also, there's nothing wrong with that.  okay, do you have equal signs written down your entire page or do you just write expressions all over the page and don't connect them through equal signs to start trying to present your work better if things really are equal write them as equal as some people do this naughty thing where they like don't put an equal sign or they put like a little arrow which means like the next thing I'm doing is  Why don't you write an equal sign then? That's what it means. It's all these things are transitioning from one state to another and you can see like the thing we cared about equal equal equal boom 20% flows nicely.  Okay, next question, you know the probability that it's going to last eight or more years.  What about that? How long do we expect on average?  So if I have this box and I keep hitting the button I could giving you dishwasher times to break down and after I've given out a whole class if you all scream the numbers back at me.  And I averaged them on my computer.  What would I get? Well, hopefully your intuition will tell you that the answer should be one over Lambda.  If there's one breakdown every 5 years.  1 / 1/5 is the number five which says you're should last about five years.  Now there's things that are not obvious like the variance and the standard deviation because you have to go to ride the formulas. We won't take the time to do them here. But here the variances went over Lambda square and the standard deviation is 1 / Lambda. She's interesting the same thing as the expected value.  Kind of like that.  Okay, so in our problem about dishwashers, like I said 1 / 1/5 is 5 so this makes a lot of sense if you set up this model based on what happens on average.  And then you say what happens on average? You should get the same idea right back out.  Now the reason it's a little janky is there when we set up Lando we demand that the numerator idea be breakdown in the denominators time.  And so since the exponential model is all about time until something if you want to know about that idea of reciprocal is required to get the time up to the numerator. So five years on average to one breakdown is what that reciprocal action is doing  Okay, the standard deviation here. It's apparently also want over Lambda. So what I expect on average is about 5 years till my break down, but if we go to standard deviation up and one down, it'll be really common experiences that human beings would have with their dishwashers.  That you could even go to standard deviations and that would be really common.  Today ago. This is the exponential model. It's really valuable for electronics and how long they take to break. So this is valuable say if you're building the Mars rover and you need to have power system and the engineers tell you well, it's it's made so an average it'll break down once every seven years. You could say. Well how many how many Power Systems do I want to I want to put a backup in place to backups and place this kind of Technology helps a model that no, one of the reasons people also study exponential is because it has a cool property that no other distribution has  It's known as memory was this which the first time you see it?  You're going to see a while that has way too many suffixes.  overly suffix words  don't know if I know any other over the suffix words.  Besides light disestablishmentarianism or whatever the anti-disestablishment over the prefix and suffix. Okay. So if you ever have an exponential model  Then it's counting how long you have to wait in sometime unit till something exciting happens.  So the memory list business property it's going to say that this model doesn't really have a memory of what's happened to it. So give me an example through politicians that will probably feel memoryless. Geyser change your favorite politician.  Who Lies a bunch  And supposed to have some averagely rate per week. There are many such choices for the current politician. I'll tell you that my dad would say choose any politician cuz he is  Pretty negative view on politics. I have more hope than that. But okay. So this is a rate, right? The discrete idea being measured is lies. And the time in this problem is set up as weeks. Okay. So there I go I set it up is 11 7. So I changed weeks over two days just to show you that if you want to change the time unit change the time unit. That's fine a week is equal to 7 days.  Okay. So now if you change it over two days, then the X variable is measuring time and days until Ally happens.  Okay. So here's the definition of memory listening to us in the first time. You see it. It's pretty overwhelming.  but if we start a break this down  It's basically saying that there's some conditional probability equal to a normal probability.  So here are the write this expression means what's the probability they can go at least T days?  without telling a lie, so that first lie when it happens  However long that is who likes to fall after t.  Is that that that's that side and you ask a question? Like could you make it a day without telling a lie?  30 would have the value one you say this all the time right now over here.  What's going on in this conditional probability is X greater than, less. It's just saying, whatever you tell your first lie. I know you've made it at least s days.  Is that a guarantee? You've made it sometime? Maybe you sat there and watched for the last s days and no lies were told.  Okay, and this question right here is saying could we make it another 30 days?  After we made it as stays.  So s + T is the total time until you take that first liar have their first lie. So if they've been doing well for a while.  Can I still make that original t days?  Beyond what you've already seen so anything that has this weird property is memoryless. And the reason is called this is if you just look at the probability. Okay. This one's saying I need to make it two days and I've already made it ass and the right-hand side is just I need to make it two days. So the memory this is referring to the fact that  You sort of Forgotten. You have no memory of the fact that it's been going well for a while and so the question of how you do and how long you can make it is not influenced by the fact you had a good track record.  Suddenly It's just like starting a fresh  So you can go prove that the exponential distribution has this property?  And it's a very counterintuitive property. It basically says like, you know when the dishwasher is deciding whether it's going to break down.  Does the dishwasher know like I like made it for years. I'm doing great.  Where did you just wake up and start washing dishes and like something could go wrong?  So there aren't a lot of things in life that have no memory of what's happened in the past.  But something to do and anything that fits that model is an exponential distribution. Okay, so we'll try those thing here. Probably they can go one day without telling a lie you do this calculation.  If somehow they made it three days.  The probability they could make one more day. Is this expression on the left? And apparently those are supposed to be equal if the exponential model is what's going on here?  Okay, so maybe like the politician was in a coma for three days.  And then they suddenly wake up and you like okay. Can we make it a day without a lie? Well, Tacoma is irrelevant all of us and you just basically asking cuz you could you make it a day.  So there's a good example like if people are in comas.  It's like something that should be a memory list is okay. Now you can show that exponential not only has this property by doing some hard integrals, but you can also show anything that has this property is the exponential distribution. So it's a unique to find anything about it. So sometimes some people are trying to decide if the exponential distribution fits whatever they're studying.  They sit there and think.  Does it make sense for this to be memoryless or have the memory loss property now electronics are the perfect example because things have wear and tear.  So if the dishwashers made it 30 years, you know that everything is on its last leg all they like rubbers are voting and stuff. So that's not the great metaphor but it turns out it roughly is exponential. Okay. So let's get this dishwasher thing and let's talk about our last distribution. This is the big one.  You've heard of this before.  So it's called the normal distribution that has lots of names the bell curve is where it got popularized and everyday Society. Some people called the gaussian distribution after its.  Sometimes people credited to Gauss the mathematician, although that's arguable.  Now, this is your first distribution that's defined for all possible values of x.  That is the height of the density function is never zero. It could give out any possible value from negative Infinity to Infinity.  It's also the first.  Distribution where the density function is very tough f of x is 1 / Sigma.  Times the square root of 2 pi * e to the negative.  x -3 squared divided by two Sigma squared  Now in this class, we're not going to need the memorization of that very much when I go next door in 5 minutes for 181b. We break it out in almost every class.  So just know that if you want to keep going it's eventually something that will be in your soul and there's a multivariate version that's even more complicated with matrices and all other nonsense. So the first evil ex is the idea on the horizontal axis LG model the random variable tells you it's possible the other variables going on are things that you get to decide and you choose when you're setting up this model some use the mean so this is the first model where you get to basically choose its expectation that I used to let him you there because it means expectation. That's a signal represents you basically setting something up where you get to determine where it is Left Right wise and once that said you get to decide how spread out it is.  It could be really impressed with the smallest make that stigma or could be really wide and you can see some examples here where a chosen different values from you and take lot.  Set set this up. So I don't need to tell you what the mean and standard deviation of this thing are because they are baked into its very definition. And that's one reason this is so powerful.  You get to basically control it.  Now this may seem like a really strange thing for me to write like why would anyone ever come up with something with this horrible density function, right?  Well, it actually happens the other way you start looking at the world and what you notice has lots of things sort of have this distribution. So if you start measuring human Heights of people  And you make a little plot of them histogram. It looks like a bell curve and males are centered is 69 in in America with this readout is when you measure how long fish are when you catch them and go fishing every day. If you catch the same kind of fish like a stickleback.  And you fought them all in your little are it looks like a normal distribution. I'm glad your diastolic blood pressure your IQ and so on so many many many things in life just happen to fit this pattern. And so then they went back and said maybe we need to figure out how it's modeled.  So we're going to focus on this the entire next class Owosso 1 minute.  I'm using it will try little example here. I just want to show you what's about to come on the horizon. Okay, so now I'm out of time.  I'll let you take a look at this. Sorry. Have a good day everyone.  sandiego.edu "
