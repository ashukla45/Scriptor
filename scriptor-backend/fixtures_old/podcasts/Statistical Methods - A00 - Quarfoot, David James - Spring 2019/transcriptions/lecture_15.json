And we five you can tell people are getting tired, right? See you around campus.  We need to continue our march on the binary Pathways of life, even though I tend to despise that kind of thinking in general. So we're going to learn a new tool today called P values and this idea appears in almost every scientific paper that you will ever read That's How prevalent  And infested the infestation of p-values if you want to think of a more pejorative term, I suppose. Okay. So last us we were doing this to decide which one we'd prefer to believe in moving forward in case our nose tended to look like set up a parameter equal in a specific value.  Maybe the average of some idea was 50.  And then you had some alternative but you when you assume the null hypothesis the cool thing about having a know that equals a specific value is it instantly centers your belief system. So when you do go collect a bunch of data and average them together, you're expecting a result of near 50.  Now just because that's what you're expecting. That doesn't mean that you're going to get 50 is variability as you can see in all these green dots. So maybe you go get an average of 59.  Obviously 59 and 50 are the same thing.  And so we decided we'll let's build a stone around 59 the contains the reasonable values from you, which was what we're trying to study now. I've never drawn it before on this picture, but you could put it right here build the interval right around X bar.  And what you're doing is you're basically standing and xbar and you're looking over at Mew.  And you're saying how far away really are you are you so far away that I can't believe in you anymore.  But I didn't really come out of a universe centered at 50 or is X bar close enough to meet you. So this whole mindset of seayes confidence intervals is trying to make a decision about Mew where you're looking from X bar, but that's not the only way to do things infected be quite natural to look at things. The other way and This is 40 Value suso hear. Our goal is to stand at Mew and look over at our data xbar and say are you too far away?  Which for some people is really more natural. So here's where we going to do the Green Dots. Okay. Let me draw a nice smooth version of everything and here we are believing we should get an average near 50 and what popped out 59  how far away is that?  What was that a thing about distance? What you could do is you could think about areas and you could shade this area to the right of 59.  And what is number tells you that you could out is it says 59 is basically in the top three point five biggest things. We could have gotten cuz over here on the right all the biggest things that could come out of a distribution center 250.  So is it weird to get something in the top 3.5% of what could have happened?  What if it were the top 1%  is it getting weird yet?  What if it's in the top 1%  When do you start feeling like things are weird in life?  Okay, this is something we're going to figure out today. So anyhow fundamental. This this idea is standing at Mew and asking if x bar strangely far away.  And this area that I just shared it is going to be called A P value with the P stands for probability and it's some sort of number or value that will help us make a decision in life.  Okay. No, this is where it gets quite confusing. There's so much infrastructure in place. So I'd like to do an example here that will sort of get us going and see how you would use the whole infrastructure from start to end.  Okay, so maybe you're teaching some static class then you've taught it before in 2017 and you're teaching it in the current year.  So in 2017 students going to 82% on the average on the final exam. Sorry, but there is some variation obviously people don't all do the same in life crazy, huh?  Now you're dissatisfied with this 82% at the instructor and you like I'm going to do better and so you maybe go to some workshop. For example, okay, this designed to improve your teaching.  okay now it's 2018 and  Maybe you are now a better teacher and your student should be doing better on average. How are you going to decide this? Well, maybe go collect a little random sample and in your random sample you get 85.7  Did the seminar really improve your teaching?  Have the receipt don't know if it really improve. Your teaching is one of these 50 people just happened to be the best people in the class. You were drawing a random sample and you got lucky. So obviously 85.7 is bigger than 82  What is that just cuz of luck in a weird sample?  That's what statistics tries to suss out or decide. Is it so far away from 82 that couldn't possibly blame it on just a weird dataset or is it reasonably close to 82 the first I'm going to set up my hypotheses again use parameters use equal signs in the Knoll.  Anybody really boring for me if nothing changed. So I'm going to set up the 2019 average the same as the 2017 and what's interesting here is you don't need a variable for 2017 average. It's given to you in the problem. So don't make more variables than you need.  Okay, so we're just focus on 2019 the alternative here is what I'm hoping is true before you look at any data. The reason you went to the workshop was to improve your teaching which be reflected in a higher from you.  So this is greater than sign because of the words not because of the number 85.7  I never let the day to help you decide what the alternative should be.  Texting you assume H not as true. You adopt a belief structure. I don't think that seminar did anything and hence when I go talk to students in the current year. I'm expecting to get an average near 82 again. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised let's go see  Now in order to be surprised I have to decide if the data are good or surprising or not. So the date RX bar, so is it weird to get the number 85.7 in the universe it centered at 82.  Play the next thing.  You have to decide what Universe you're talking about here since we're talking about averages.  Then we should live on a sampling distribution, which is a distribution that shows what results you might get from samples if you say take averages in them. So we discovered the other day that they should be normal. It should be centered on whatever your belief system is.  okay, I think I'm going to get things near 82 but when you recognize a spread out in this it should be Sigma over the square root of n  okay. So here are the numbers basically say I want something you're 82, but I recognize I can get things plus or minus a couple standard deviations things up. 1.697 higher would be pretty common. For example.  No, I love to draw pictures of what's going on. I think it helps a lot more than just throwing symbols all over the place. So what you doing now is the sampling distribution. This is a picture of an x-bar could do European life and it's only centered 82 because that's what you believe currently.  That doesn't mean it's actually the truth. It's just your current state and here I drop down are one particular datum the 85.7.  Navigate has lots of ways to try to decide how weird this result is. When we talked about z-scores, you could measure how many standard deviations that is above the mean.  Something like four or five would be crazy for five standard deviations above.  Okay, you can try to measure the distance but that's meaningless. Cuz unless you know what the standard deviation is and then using the z-score or you could start shaving the area like we talked about at the beginning of class.  That one thing you can do is you can just say well why don't I find the probability of seeing X bar given the Assumption of each.  Just tell me how likely it is to see 85.7.  If it's a low probability, I'll say.  82 oz of stupid thing to believe in just a high probability. I'll be like we saw it totally typical event. I'm not excited in life. But the trouble with this question, you're asking a probability question on a continuous random variable.  So the probability of getting any particular outcome is 0  and that is why I shaded a region instead of just asking about the area right above 85.7.  So unfortunately p-values have this weird construction because we're dealing with continuous random variables. So here's what you end up finding the probability of seeing your particular data.  Or something more extreme than interval.  And we can shade areas over intervals and get nonzero numbers and this is known as a P value. So in this case, I'm going to shade to the right and when your shading  you're going to shade in the direction that supports the alternative the alternative here screaming. I think you should be getting really big averages cuz I think the average is much higher than the number you currently believe 82.  Okay, so that's why I should have distraction had to do with the one-sidedness of the alternative.  okay so when you do this in our or minitab or whatever program Your Lovin life or using tables yet .01 5  so we got a result in the top 1.5 highest result we could have  from this curve  if the curva center today D2  Is that getting weird?  How beautiful does someone have to be before you turn and look when they walk by you?  the top 5% of beauty  Do you have higher standards the top 1% of beauty?  Everyone has some cut off tree like whoa.  So what we need to do is decide on some cut off and that's just an arbitrary choice in case of the p-value here is just the area.  Once you shade your data or something more extreme on this curve centered dictated by the null hypothesis and what you do with the P value.  This is the next issue. We were supposed to be making a binary decision in life.  So this is a very new at this people. You could have been almost anything. It's a very smooth possibility zone. So we've got a dichotomize what's going on? So what you do next is you set some sort of cut off and you do this before you even start the problem you decide in advance what weirdness means to you? Maybe it's hitting something in the top 5% strangest results. So if you're a five percenter person, then you said what's known as the significance level and it's usually given the letter Alpha and we'll set .05  And if you get something that is less likely than this cut off then you're going to throw away the Knoll and move over to the alternative and that's how you make your binary decision in life. Okay. So all you do is compare your number if it's less than .05 if you're among the top 5% strangest things here. We are among the top 1.5% strangers things.  Then we're going to reject not in feature in in favor of the alternative people will say this is a statistically significant result statistically cuz we used to tistics significant because it was so strange and significant to us that we threw out a belief system based on the data. That's a pretty significant moment. I would say for this to happen.  Statistically significant. Oh my goodness. So here's our little binary rule anytime you going to p-value less than Alpha. You can reject the null anytime you get something greater than or equal to Alpha you can keep that is don't reject the no.  No, some books will do this old differently will see if you're less than or equal to Alpha.  Reject the null equal sign on the greater than one. It doesn't matter you're talking about a zero probability event getting a P value exactly equal to Alpha zero probability. Who cares? What you doing life?  Okay.  Now this idea of a p-value is perhaps the most misunderstood thing and all of Statistics. In fact in 2016. The American statistical Association had to put out a paper.  It was basically entitled what a p-value is and what it isn't because the community was so incredibly confused about what was going on and I agree. It's a complicated idea, but most people get one or two days on this topic in a stack class, which is their only that class ever and then they go off and be researchers.  So they will really understand. In fact, you can go to statistical conferences or people do research and you can walk around with a camera and say what's a p-value and they've done this.  And a terrific what you see people are scared when you ask them that question.  People don't know what's going on. So that all sorts of videos of this. Anyhow, here's what a p-value is. It's the probability. That's why there's a p in it.  Seeing your data and I put a little plus sign here which means or something more extreme. If you just asked about the probability of the data without the plus sign the answer 0 and there's no reason to have this concert. Also, you only do all of this calculation after you've assumed some null hypothesis is true.  Furthermore it's even more complicated when I say or something more extreme and put that plus sign. I have to know what the alternative is to decide which way to shade in some picture.  What's the probability of senior data or something more extreme relative to the alternative hypothesis?  Assuming the null hypothesis is true.  You see why people are confused. It's just incredibly complicated object.  Anyhow, so if you get a really low P value.  This doesn't really support your belief system. You've got some result. That's so incredibly strange. It's better to throw your belief system and move to a new universe. So you'd like to go support the alternative.  Okay, and again when your shading this you have to go back and look at your alternative and say what is the alternative hoping to see what kind of values would support the alternative way from the Knoll see the Noah's here around 82.  Another Valley so supportive to your shading values that don't support it to see what kind of evidence there is basically how far you've gotten away from what you currently believe.  In relation to the alternative now, this is where most people get confused. They think a P value is the probability.  That the null hypothesis is true or not.  That's not true at all. It has to do with the data that you're getting in relation to the hypothesis.  Another thing the reason this is so silly to ever write something like this hypotheses are either true or false called the universe.  It'll tell you if something is true is the sum of two even numbers always even call up the universe. Yes. So there's no probability associated with it. Either is or isn't something.  okay, it's also another probably the alternative is true or false cuz again  That's not a random event. That shouldn't have a probability associated with it.  If you go ask this is honey. I love the studies on statistical education you go. Ask a class like you first introduction to stats for most people you guys graduate students U-verse researchers.  And you say is the p-value the probability the null hypothesis is true.  30 to 50% of all those groups say yes.  I got a fundamentally bad people's understanding of P values is and even worse. It doesn't get better when your education level goes up from undergrad to Masters to having a PhD it just Flatline. There's just as consistent misconception everyone has  Threaten it so bad. I personally don't understand what's really going on. You're trying to measure data and how they relate to belief systems. So it should use both of them in the answer really proud to bring probabilities on non random events, which makes no sense whatsoever. So they have absolutely no understanding of the concept of probability.  What a mess.  anyhow  has my big brand for the day. We're going to try a two-sided example and suck up some of your data in the process.  Let me be the Facebook friend count average among all math 183 students.  ever  set the alarm for population big hard to study everybody right with ever mean in the past in the future.  Okay, so that's some number if I could call it the Universe I could figure it out but I don't have that Lifeline that phone your friend claims that this average is different than the average for math 11 students. The math 11 is another interest a class. It's you should think about math 11 vs. 183 like math 10 vs. Math 21 tens to serve social science the other tends to serve stem. Okay. So what we're about to do is make a two-sided alternative hypothesis. We're going to get excited about your friend count either being higher than the math 11 number or lower than the math 11 number.  To get excited about a two-sided alternative you need to be able to argue. Why might be reasonable to see a number higher or one lower.  So someone tell me give me some emotion in your soul on why your Facebook friend count should be higher than math 11 students.  Go ahead.  183 upper-division course number take later in your career means you're older you've had more time to accumulate friends beautiful seems believable. Now someone argue why your average might be lower.  Reckon, you don't have to believe in what you're about to say. It just has to be so much reasonable.  Go ahead.  younger people use social media more than older people  and since you all are older y'all will have less friends.  See both of you were using the same fiery, but getting to different conclusions. It's just like watching the news right now. You have one. Do you believe that?  You don't believe that you like the old do you like the bigger idea?  Since they both possible, I agree old people don't use social media as much like my parents. My mom has nine Facebook friends.  Okay, but the question is like they're so personal. There's two two pieces of logic Siri, right? And there's many other theories that you're probably sitting there thinking to write in Witcher wrong. There might be truth in all of them. It's about the relative weight of the theories which way do they actually tip the scale?  That's what you want to know. So stop putting binary decisions on people's logic. Most logic has some truth to it.  I guess that might be true. Most things have some truth. I guess that's vague enough.  Okay. Now let's put some numbers on here. I happen to know the average Facebook friend count of all math 11 students cuz I talked to Infinity people yesterday.  Wasn't that sweet of me? The number is 440.  and spread out in this  283  this is actual data, by the way, it's not all but it's thousands. Hopefully you'll agree that probably all close enough, right?  Suppose that your universe is just a spread out is that universe? So basically what I'm about to do is equate the two universes. That's what my nose was going to be. So those are all the same spreads and means and so on. Okay, so here's my no.  4:40 is what I believe about y'all. Are you sitting there thinking of your number?  Well, first of all, we need to take an average here. The alternative is two-sided because we argued for both I forced us to that was the only reason  Play what happens next after you set your hypotheses now. It's time to go get yourself some day.  So let's do this. We're going to go to Socrative. You're going to send me your number of friends on Facebook.  If you're not on Facebook you can skip this part cuz I already know what your number is going to be.  number of fb friends  which logic is going to rain Supreme here?  So how long do we wait?  How many people at home I can't have your data right now? What's going on? I want your data.  23 not enough people yet.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no news has Facebook changed the Instagram.  That's probably a good idea. I'm going to blow up the slides and completely redo them for next year cuz I hate them their garbage. So I will change this Instagram. I agree Instagram is better who wants to read words. You just want to see pictures, right?  There I go projecting my own beliefs on to everybody.  Okay.  Show answers.  1200 look at that.  Now we have a problem right now. Are you a random sample of 183 students?  Well, first of all, you're taking it in the spring you think spring students?  Are different than all students?  The people track through the system during certain times of the year in certain ways.  Another issue to think about not only use spring students the rest of the students that will come to an 8 a.m. Class are 8 a.m. Merz representative of all students.  Okay, in addition, there's another issue you're the people that actually came to class at 8 a.m. Via tenders.  Do you think the tenders?  Looks like all students. Do you think you're stronger or weaker or the same?  You think you're stronger?  12000  llorar decider  you want to cut?  I'm sorry.  Well, this is not the we're not trying to include all the people that aren't here. This is an individual's number. It's not the number for all the missing values. You said to cut it. It's gone. You see anything else. You don't like 6:58.  Thumbs up is it to specific?  1200 you didn't like 12,000 order-of-magnitude last decide.  Keep it.  How sweet of you  Okay, should we save this let's get it down to a crummy data format.  How about a CSV file?  It's the crummiest data format that exists.  , separated values  Nope, not going back to your original way of structuring things.  now, let's bring this into our  We're going to go back to the slides in a moment and I had to have used some number in the slides. So did I guess the number that's about to happen if this moment let's find out.  Okay, here we go. Where is data?  Where did data go?  Oh my goodness.  Let's figure out what's going on here.  Did I lose the data set already?  Today is not for 1.  We lost the data set.  today's 5 3  I guess it didn't want me to save things not in the Excel file format interesting, huh?  Forgot to Riga go redo everything.  my goodness  ctrl-c ctrl-v. Come on.  So you only wanted to cut this right nothing else.  Maybe I clicked on the wrong button somewhere to all this mess. Put it on the desktop collegedata.  Do a CSV file.  save  Okay.  Good try again.  I'm really curious what your number is.  It keeps changing every time I do this.  What's important?  Okay. So now we have data you can go pull out the Facebook friend count there. You all are not many of you people at home. Why aren't you here? We needed your data.  289  Has Facebook done?  Is that what this means?  I wonder if I chose to 89 in the slides. Let's go see.  That's obviously not the number 440 you're not as friends. He is math 11. What is it so far away that it couldn't have come out of the universe Center to 4:40.  That's the real question that we want to ask now.  So let's go take a look.  First what distribution are we living on? We just took an average X bar. It could have been a different number, right? So what number did x-bar come from what universe so it comes from the sampling distribution. We were expecting if our belief system were true.  ticket something near 440  but we recognize there's some variation to 83 / \u221a 50 in the 283 was the spread out anise the math 11 students, which I assumed was the same of the 183 students and I chose 50 people as my sample size cuz I had to put a number there and I didn't know how many of you would give me your data today. So again, I'm just using made-up numbers right here. Okay, so I was expecting something from a 440 Universe with the spread out in this.  Okay. Now let's suppose the result were 500. We just gotten not 280 whatever. Okay in that case I drop down 500.  And I need to shade an area that is more extreme than that under the guise of what the alternative would have been excited about. So you see me shading above. Hey that gets us away from 4:40. Any alternative says we're not 4:40, but he also notice I went over here to the other side and created the symmetrically placed point in case a 560 about 4:40. So just went down 60 and I created 380 now we did not get 380. I agree. That's what you're feeling in your soul, right?  But there's all sorts of other things. We didn't get that. We're shading we didn't get 501 but we're still shading it because it's a result that supports the alternative being away from 4:40.  And all these values over here, so anytime it's two-sided you drop down your data, which must fall on one of the sides.  You create the Symetra placing you should both ways to Tails. This is why it's called a two-sided alternative because you end up dating both of the Tails here and it's their combined area that gives the p-value there's a lot of ways to do this since the two tails will have the same amount of area each you can just double and do one of the calculations. So here meet you see me saying, okay. I want to shave from 500.  I want to go toward the upper tail on this curve for 40, 40, which is the sampling distribution dates are shaded the top right area and then I doubled it and we got a point one.  3  Okay, you can also double the bottom tail or you can add up to different areas. Whatever you want to do. Okay. So there is RP Valley if we use the number 500 which isn't what we got.  So now we want to interpret what just happened.  so basically  If we use the number 504 now it says our data was among the top 13.4 strangest things. We could have gotten.  That's not that strange 13% event. That's like rolling a die and getting the number one. That's the one out of six or 16% You don't get scared or excited when a one comes up, right? In fact, it's so boring and ordinary that you just roll again usually or whatever you're doing in life just goes by on unchecked. So usually if you use .05 is your rejection or critical level of significance level in this case, we're going we're not going to reject going to keep the no.  How do you feel?  Okay, something happened. Okay. So here's what happened in a different quarter. It was very recent.  We took the day off. We went in shaded things and we got a P value of 2.047. So is it just right below the cut off now you want to see what you are.  Let's go see what kind of P value you get.  So here we are to 89.26.  You want to see this in minitab?  As long as I can. Math 11, this is what they use in minitab. Is this what they use for their class instead of our okay, so you can draw pretty pictures and this is how I draw a lot of these for this class you can say, I love to draw distribution and shade an area of it. What distribution do you want to be on? How about 4:40 with a spread out and it's a 40 when I get an x-bar. That's what it comes from. How do you wash a the area? I'll specify a thing on the horizontal axis and I'll show you both Tales. We got the number 289 go showed me this area.  Wow, look at that.  So I put 289 down and shaded to the left. You can't even see it.  It created the symmetric place by calculating the distance to the center and then going that same distance and it's shaded to the right can't see the area. It finds the area in both tails. Look. They're the same they have to be normal distribution is symmetric and you have them together and you get a P value is incredibly tiny.  So our P value for y'all is less than .05 statistically significant result throw out the Knoll 440 is a stupid number to believe in the universe gave us the value 289. Doesn't come out of the universe Center to 4:40. Sorry.  That what do you know at the end of this if you moved to the alternative the alternate just said I was excited about either direction.  So that's what you have to believe now. You shouldn't be sitting here believing that you're less than 440 because in order to find your P value you had to leverage things to the left of 289 and to the right.  So all you believe at the end of this is your not 4:40 now getting this data, you might move forward and say well maybe were 300 and you might set an alternative less than that. That's your choice in how you move forward the piss test only got us not equaling 440. That's a frustrating thing about setting up a two-sided alternative your data are going to land on one side.  but at the end when you reject the null, you're just excited about either side still so it feels  feels like a phony victory of some sort. I don't know.  Okay, now, let's see if you can do things.  So here's Dexter is my best buddy in life. There's just a therapy dog. Sometimes he comes to UCSD and you pet him maybe you've seen him before if you go to the petting thing during exam weeks, right?  Now the reason they bring Dexter to school is because they believe that therapy dogs can lower stress.  Sip actually true or is it all just Placebo nonsense?  Well, maybe you decide to run a little study here.  Okay, so you have two populations one is people that don't go get dog therapy and the other is those that do  Now when you go ask them how stressed out they are. You have to use some instrument to do this. So maybe about a survey or maybe they have to put their stress level on a 0 to 100 scale and they just a Mouton to the survey. Okay, that's fine. People do this all the time.  Without dogs you go. Ask all students ever.  I don't know how you did that. But you get an average stress level of 81 populations non-dog students and students to go see dogs, but we don't know how to study two populations yet. So what you see me doing here is giving you the parameter for one of them.  So defectively means we don't need to study that population. We don't need to sample from that. We completely understand it and what we're going to study are the students to go see dogs. So now we only one population and was going to take the number from that universe and bring it over later. We'll learn how to study to populations when you don't know anything about either and you need to sample from both but here we just sampling from one. Okay, you sample 25 things that were signed at the pet therapy? Okay. So you noticed I'm not like just go talking to the people who happen to be at the pet therapy. Maybe the people that go to pet therapy or dog lovers and maybe dog lovers have higher or lower stress levels are higher stress levels naturally and it's not cuz they go to the pet therapy is because of who they are.  So what you do is you just take a bunch of suits and randomly assign them and some have to go to pet therapy. Okay, so they had an average of 78.5.  Obviously the number look slower.  But is it so much lower?  That 81 is a stupid thing to believe in life.  So it doesn't provide strong evidence that therapy to creases things. Give me a parameter that we're going to study in this problem. Put a letter on it to find it in words. Let's go.  Okay, most of the people in the room are getting this wrong the writing hypotheses. I don't want any of that right now. I just want you to find a parameter. So it should have a Greek letter and you just tell me what it's about. What are we trying to measure right now average stress level in what population UCSD students that have dog therapy?  That population has perhaps millions or Infinity students if UCSD goes on forever.  Okay, or if you don't want to look into the future, you can say all UCSD students that have existed or all UCSD students in the current year something that feels big there's lots of ways to set up the population here once you have that in place.  Write me some hypotheses. What would be boring? What would be exciting?  A really boring a pet therapy did nothing and if it does nothing then putting people through it should make an average dress of 81 now here. I did a one-sided alternative not because the number 78.5 that's using your data to decide what to believe in life, which is not science.  You looking here read the words blah blah blah. You're curious if it lowers stress lines right there. That's how I made the decision to put the less than sign.  Okay, so that's how you set these up. That's what you're hoping going into this next thing you need to decide when you go collect data and get an average what curve it's coming from?  So find the model for the sampling distribution, that is what shape is the curve. Where is it centered how spread out it is.  And remember you assume H. Not as soon as you write those hypotheses.  Okay, so hopefully by now you realize sampling distribution. Oh, that's just normal thing. It's centered it. Whatever you currently believe. It should be centered at that's called me you that's from the Knoll and it's right out, This is Sigma over the spirit event.  This is starting to get really messy.  So what does Sigma mean here? Well in truth, it means the spread out notice of the world you're trying to study which is individuals telling you how stressed out they are after a pet therapy. Maybe you have that number. I don't know how you would maybe you don't. Okay? Maybe you have an approximation of it that comes from your data set the standard deviation. Maybe you don't even have that. Maybe you have a fact from the population are comparing it to  And here's hoping that will be equally spread out. So we'll sort all that out later. So right now just find whatever standard deviation you got and use it.  Okay, so apparently we're expecting a number near 81.  Cuz that's what we assumed.  but there could be some variation and we recognized it could go up and down 1.4 couple 1.4 s  next draw me a picture of what's going on. So draw the sampling distribution.  Drop down the data onto it and shave me an area that represents the P value.  Almost every homework problem with force you to do this to draw this picture.  Okay, so here's some thoughts first.  When you drop me this picture look on your page and see if you drew a y-axis or vertical axis. If you did stop doing that, there's no need to.  Okay, just drop a horizontal axis and then put the curve. Okay, the 81 is easy to picture and you should write that the standard deviation of this picture, which is 1.4. It's right hard to show in the picture. So don't bother trying to show it.  Then the day that you throw down with 78.5 and I shaded to the left because we were excited about seeing smaller ideas. If you go back to this right here, we think values way to the left of 81.  Get us away from the Knoll.  And start getting us to the Alternatives claim. That's why I only shaded one side.  Now you need to find this area all my goodness. Lots of ways to find the area. Can you write one line of code in r that does it?  over a. Of time  I'm not taking any more of your time than I deserve. So I'm going to stop I would look at the rest of the slides. Are there some nice ones to help you but have an awesome weekend.  UC San Diego podcast "
