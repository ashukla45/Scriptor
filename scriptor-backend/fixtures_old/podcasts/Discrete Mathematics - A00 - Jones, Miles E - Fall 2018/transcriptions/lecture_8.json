  "Full Transcript": "listening to a podcast  good morning class.  Morning.  All right.  Let's get started.  So what are we doing today?  We're going to continue with this nested quantifiers trying to translate these things so he can get a good idea.  Talk about the truth values are nested quantifiers. What else then we're going to move into the sort of the next topic. It's basically just how to prove things. So we'll look today at  a few examples of some proofs after that so  Solutions posted on Piazza for the homework for the what was that homework to that you can turn in this weekend. There's a common issues post. So we try their kind of collect all the common mistakes that you guys have done post them on Piazza so you can look at them and see why they're a mistake and how to do it the correct way.  and  on grade scope there is a possibility that you'll get some comments on your work. Even if you got full credit just to kind of give you some tips here and there or if you know if we have some suggestions on how we want to see your work presented.  look at all those things before you make a regrade request if it's still you, have a nice question about your  Graven pain, please. Let us know.  Okay, let some we've already done these these nested quantifiers, but I wanted to revisit them again, so  Maybe did we do this one yet?  Okay, so this  predicate is ex has sent a text to why? Okay. So how would you interpret this proposition?  Okay, so there's one person that sent a text to everybody in the class.  Right. So one person sent out a text to everybody.  There's this some access that brawl why I sent a text to why can't you send a text to himself to write?  We said that was allowed.  Okay, how about this one?  For all X there exists a y such that Q of X Y.  Yeah, so this one is a little bit different right? This is saying that everybody has send a text to somebody else or somebody, right?  Maybe two people sent the same text to somebody maybe some person just send a text to itself and so on right?  Okay.  everybody  sent  a text to at least  one person  Okay, so we switched around some stuff. Okay. Here's another one where we're actually switching around the for all X in the Adair exist Y and we're going to get something different. What's this one?  The other way because it is there exists why that's the recipient.  So one person got a text from everybody in the class.  Was texted by everyone.  You have that one person and he's happy, right?  Cuz you so popular.  And you send a text to himself to?  All right. How about this one?  Yeah, everybody is seat received a text from at least one person.  Okay, good any questions about these so far?  Everyone send a text to someone in San Jose.  That's the same right because someone is at least one person.  Okay, how about this one?  Everybody send a text to everybody else right or everybody?  for all X  and for all y x send a text to why so this is just like all possible pairs, right?  talk  everybody  send a text.  if everybody  all possible pairs  I saw that any questions about that one.  All right.  let's think about what are the  what is how do you we restrict The Domain in order to make this true or false? So in which domain is this statement true?  Maybe what we could do first is translated into English, right? So this would be for all.  X  I guess X in the domain.  Right, which is what we're going to kind of look at.  There is a y such that.  X is less than y queso.  What are you guys say?  Looks like most people are going with c.  positive real numbers  Okay, so does that make sense for every positive real numbers for every positive real number X I can find a a bigger positive real number.  Okay, so that's good. How about  this 101 all the real numbers in the closed interval 0 want does this work?  Okay good. So this statement is claiming that for all X in the domain. I can find a y in the domain that's bigger than x but if I choose X to be one in this domain then there's no there's no other number in that domain that's bigger than one. So this one fails  Okay, how about the set of integers 1 2 3?  Write it so you can't pick 3.  write something  If x is equal to 3 there's nothing in there that's bigger than three. How about negative integers?  Right, nothing bigger than -1.  prank  Okay, here's kind of a tricky one. What about all negative?  real numbers  Okay. Yeah, I could right because there actually is no upper bound.  Well, there is a profound but the upper bout the the least upper bound is not part of the set. So any number that you got you can always find a number that's bigger than that in that set because we're talking about the Continuum of all real numbers. If you like. You can just take whatever number is in is midway between your number X and zero and that will never will still be in the set.  Funny one. Okay any questions?  All right. How about this one?  In which domain is the statement not true.  Okay, so  you can either just try to kind of negate it or maybe we can use like the de Morgan's law to simplify the negation and make it maybe a little bit more.  easy to to understand so if I negate this thing  Write this logically equivalent to what whenever the negation passes over a for all it turns it into a there exists and vice versa. So this becomes actual there exists X there exists why for all Z and then you negate this statement?  Which is this not want to see?  And so there is a there is a x and there is a y so there's a pair X and Y.  Such that for all the Z in the in the set X X Y is not equal to Z.  Okay. So a lot of people are saying all negative numbers.  I know that negative integers. What's kind of think about why? Okay, let's start with that one all negative integers. Okay, so if X and Y are negative integers  Then XY is positive, right?  So XY is going to not equal any of the elements of that set any of the  Any negative integer is always going to be positive. So that's good.  How about all real numbers in the closed interval 0 1 the problem with this one? Is that whenever you multiply two numbers in the set, you will always get another number in that same set. That's kind of what the question is that is is getting at  How about all real numbers same thing? Right? If you ever multiply two real numbers you always get another real number everytime positive real numbers the same thing positive integers and sell.  Okay any questions about this?  And so I say again.  What's -0?  Is what?  Is that a thing?  No, I for now is zero is just you.  I think about that though.  But zero is not a negative number not even negative zero is is it or is it?  Okay, zero is not a negative number.  Okay, let's some let's do some some more exercises. I want you guys to  Write this in terms of quantifiers. Okay, ready go.  Okay, so you're going to have to Define what your predicate is.  say like P of X Y is equal to  Or is the statement.  X is positive or Y is x times y or something like that.  Okay. So what what do I want my predicate to be P of x?  Is what the statement?  X is positive, right?  Do what you guys do.  Okay, so then there's two ways to kind of go about this either we can state with the domain is and do it that way or we can kind of put the domain inside of the print into the proposition. So one way to say it, is that the domain  is  negative  real real numbers  and then you just say for all X.  PR screaming for all x 4 all y  p of x * y  Any questions about that?  Yeah.  Maybe it'd be better if I if I kind of called this a different thing.  Like this is like P of Z means that Z is positive rights. Just kind of like a  a variable in there  But X and Y both come from the domain, but that doesn't say anything about what their product is. Now the other way to write it.  Would be you'd say for all X for all Y and then you'd say something about the domain, right?  X is negative and Y is negative.  That's just saying that they are both negative numbers this implies P of x * y.  I saw you guys it's just it's just about your personal preference. Do you want to State the domain first and just say for everything in the domain or you can kind of specifically say what the domain is in the proposition.  X and Y are not equal to a real.  Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, so  Right, I'd say.  and  X is X and Y are real X is real.  And why is real?  Sorry about that to be to be most specific.  Yeah, I'm using the same predicate. Sorry. I should maybe go like this.  That your question.  yeah, and in most cases, I don't know if I want to make it like a blanket saying but  yeah, sometimes you only work with integers and sometimes you know, the predicate is only really make sense with integers. This one makes sense with real numbers and  I should I should be more careful. I think.  I think so. Yeah, I think so, but just maybe maybe ask for clarification if if you run into it.  That's if you have a for all.  Remember we had like the for all and then they'd there exist.  So if it's for all you do domain and pies the  got the predicate.  Let's do another one.  I like this one the difference between a real number and itself is zero.  Okay, and you can choose whether to Define your predicate itself or just right in what it is. So what do I mean by that?  You can just say something like domain.  is  all real numbers  Frank and then the statement would be for all X.  X minus X is zero.  Something like that, or you can Define the predicate to be like pfx is the statement X is zero or something like that. So  Just mainly how you want to it's your personal preference how you do that any questions about this one?  All right, last one. No.  How many do I have okay, here's another one a negative real number does not have a square root. That is a real number. So let's do  the domain here  Will be negative real numbers.  or no  cuz it kind of depends on what I want to do here.  I guess I want to have like two kind of domains, right?  I guess that's just say that the domain is all real numbers.  Okay, so then this just says that for all X.  Better negative, right?  and for all  why that's positive.  right  square root X is not equal to y.  Does that work?  the Deschutes iPhone square root Executives who invented real number without  No, I'm saying for all y+.  I'm restricting X to be negative and why to be positive and I'm saying for every pair of negative number positive number the square the negative number is not equal to the positive number.  No, cuz I'm I'm restricting why to be positive here.  Not looking at wife.  Oh, it's a real number. I see what you guys are saying.  So you just put it like this.  Like for all X less than 0 square root X is not real.  Yeah.  That also works, right?  So you don't want it. You don't want to set a predicate to be a mom like a mathematical operation. Like for example, if you say p of why is square root wire or something like that does not going to be good because you want your predicate to have a truth value and needs to be like a statement. So it needs to be something like Scribble square root square root. Why is real or  Something that you can assign a truth value to because the value of that is going to be some number.  Okay good. So you can alternatively do domain is all negative numbers.  Real strength and then you just say for all X.  Square root X is not real.  That's probably the best huh?  Okay.  All right, last one for sure this time.  Every positive real number has exactly two square roots.  now it doesn't say what these where these two square roots can come from I'm assuming that it's like  You should really say exactly to.  real square roots  song  The Domain  I'll say is real numbers.  Will have for all X.  greater than 0  right  Then what?  So there exists a y there exists a z such that.  Because we said exactly two.  jacksepticeye  and yeah, you can do it that way to it has been the proposition is that exactly two square root, but let's see if we can figure it out with with these with these things Okay, so  so we're saying that for all X greater than 0 there's a y and there's a z  Such that okay, and then we need another one for all w.  But you also need to say that y&z are the only ones right?  Okay, so  for all  okay for all X greater than 0 there is a y and there is a z  such that for all.  W not equal to Y and W not equal to Z.  If I can say for all W just do that, look at here we go square root X.  No.  This one's getting complicated.  Let's just do every positive real number has two real square roots. How about that?  All right.  And then we just say square root X or no, let's say it like this y squared is equal to x and z squared is equal to X.  And why is it? All right and Y is not equal to Z.  right  Okay, that's good. Alright do the  original statement  as an exercise  okay, so let's move on with the with the logical equivalence of the  nested quantifiers Okay, so  Is it true that for every meaning of the predicate in every domain of discourse not there exists there exists X for all y p of x y and for all X there exists why not give ex-wife has always has the same truth value.  It's always the case.  I have you guys think about that. All right, let's go into the proof. So here's like a fine comic or what I think is funny. So one of the people says just for the sake of argument, let's say that and he says wait for the sake of what argument. Okay, cool. That's totally a good reason to say something that's wrong. I have arguments. He's just trolling the other person the whole time. So I think it's kind of funny. Anyhow, so arguments or going to be kind of the framework that we build troops on. Okay. So we're going to say that an argument is valid if every step of the way is logically is a logical step.  And a valid argument also will at the very end.  Establish the truth of a statement. Okay. So so valid it just means that the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the premises and the preceding statement. So I have to be valid throughout the whole thing. Okay, an argument is just a sequence of statements.  ending with a conclusion  Okay, so when we build these proofs there's certain things that we just kind of assumed to be true. And these kind of type of things are axioms statements that you assume are true. And a lot of the times you'll see that axioms are these kind of universal statements that everybody agrees upon to be true and you can use them to kind of filled your proof. So if anybody has taken any kind of euclidean geometry class, you'll see that a lot of the theorems are built on these axioms very simple things, but nobody has proven them. So the axioms in euclidean Geometry are  Two lines cross in in one point, right? The intersection of two lines is one point, right? Another one is that if you connect two points you get a line, right? It's really hard to prove these things. They're just kind of statements that we all agree upon.  Okay. So the once you get the axioms and the assumptions you build your rules are inference and your your argument and you end up at a conclusion. Once you've done that what you've done is you have constructed a proof and the original statement is a theorem.  so  mathematicians like to have all these fancy words for theorems. They're all basically the same thing so fear of proposition fact result Lemma corollary, they're all the same. It's just a statement that has been proven by somebody.  all this means  statement  that has been proven.  Okay. So what rules of inference are allowed what makes a an argument valid what makes a step-by-step process each step valid.  Okay.  So I know which propositions are substituted and the conclusion is true if all premises are true.  okay, so there's a bunch of fancy names that you may run into modus ponens modus tollens and these are  these are used a lot maybe in the book in the text or a maybe in like a  logic class or philosophy class when you're trying to build arguments in this class. We're not really going to learn these words were just going to kind of learn how to use them.  But I will say something about these first two.  So the first one modus ponens is basically direct proof and you don't have to worry about the fancy name. Just remember how to do a direct proof.  Okay, so I direct proof is good when you're trying to prove an implication. So we want to prove if P then Q we want to prove P implies Q. Okay. So here's how you do you assume p is true. Then you use your rules of inference this in this and that and hopefully you end up and conclude that Q is true.  So there's another way to do this is called modus tollens, but I like to use proof by contrapositive better because it actually tells you what you're doing is you can change p.m. Pais que to not Q implies not-p.  Right, so I'm still trying to prove the same statement, but I'm doing it in a different way. So I'm proving if not you then not P. How do you do that? Well, you assume.  not qu  right..... Conclude  not too and since those since every implication is  logically equivalent to its contrapositive this proof will prove the original statement.  conservative news that  okay, so let's dive into an example.  I have these two statements and squared + 1 is greater than equal to 2 and 1 and has a negative integer and square + 1 is greater than equal to 2 and 1 and has a positive integer. What can you say about truth values of these statements?  just by your  Intuition or your your previous education of arithmetic  What are we saying?  Anybody have any comments?  Kind of have like a competing viewpoints hear that either both are true or one is true into his false.  First one as an gets bigger to the end of smaller to the left side of crows.  That's true.  play to the negative ones don't have to do it before it's okay, right so  So one is true, right?  And this is actually the one that we're going to prove. We're also going to prove to to be false wise to false.  Okay good. So that's kind of like a good sort of.  way of  convincing yourself that it's false, right? Maybe you see it. You're like, oh, yeah. Oh this faster than quadratic. So it's got to be false. But what if I really actually wanted a a concrete reason?  Videos to enter a value where that statement is not true. So we put like I'm sure it has fibers there for you. Get 25 on the left hand side then 32 on the right hand side if you get this in  okay good so you can this is false and you can prove it with a counterexample, right?  Okay. So remember that these you these Universal conditionals can be translated to this kind of statement where we say for all and if n is negative then the statement is true. So  We're going to use that implication as our structure for the proof for the direct proof. Okay, so if I have something like this.  Crooked this statement is false. I need to find.  a counterexample  to prove that the statement is true. Then you have to do a direct proof and this is like something in the domain.  Is imply some predicate, right?  And there is a general form that mathematicians most always follow and it goes like this you select some general element of the domain.  And to do that usually say usually say something like this let X be in the domain.  Aren't you say that and then you use these logical statements on X as if it were any number and try to get to the conclusion?  Okay, and that will that will show that it's true for all elements of the domain because it didn't matter which acts that you chose to begin with.  Okay, how do we prove that this is false while we already kind of did right since this is a universal conditional statement to prove that is false. It's enough to find one counterexample, and we considered and is equal to 5.  And we get that V squared + 1 is 26 to the 5th is 32 and the left hand side is less than the right hand side and that contradicts the statement. And so the answer is false. And so this is a proof that it's false.  And one way to kind of think about why we only need a counterexample.  Is because the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement if I wanted to gate for all I just have to show that there exists something that doesn't work.  Okay good.  alright, so  I would never want to prove that. This is true. We probably won't get through the whole proof. But let's just kind of get it started and this is what I want to show. Remember you safe for all and then you talk about the domain.  And then you say something right? This is kind of the statement or the predicate that you want to show.  Okay, so I say let N be an integer a general element of the domain for a direct proof. What do I assume?  White this is apparently.  queso  We assume.  Okay, so  Are we jumping on the bandwagon here? Okay, so this is good because I'm so be okay. KO C is the right answer. I want to assume.  Be hypothesis, which is that and is negative. This is what I want to assume remember be is what you want to prove so you don't want to assume that in the beginning you want to kind of logically get there.  From the Assumption. Okay, so I assume and is less than 0 and see how you can get to the end.  All right.  Aren't we only have one more minute left?  so  let's just kind of go one step further.  Maybe I can ask you guys to think about how to do this as an exercise.  think about  how  to finish this proof  as an exercise  Okay, how do you use the hypothesis? What's important about envying less than zero that makes this true, right and we know that that's important because we already showed that if n is greater than zero. It's not true. So there has to be something about him being less than zero to help you prove it right you need to use that information somehow. Okay. I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
