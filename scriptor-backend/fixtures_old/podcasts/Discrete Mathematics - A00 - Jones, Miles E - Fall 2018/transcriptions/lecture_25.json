  "Full Transcript": "podcast  Who created the Border in everyone?  So let's get started.  We're going to continue along with this discussion of  Relations what comes out of relations with equivalence relations right equivalence relations, give rise to equivalence classes and equivalence classes are nice ways to partition a set into like kind of grouping similar.  Similar elements together and you know, there's many ways that you could do this. That's because there's many equivalence classes that you can Define on the same set.  We're going to look at one equivalence class Topic in particular, which is the  the congruence modulo M equivalence relation that means and why is equivalence class what you can do with it? What are some applications in computer science? Because it's it's very  Directly linked to a lot of stuff in cryptography security hashing random pseudo random numbers those kind of things.  Okay, so let's remind ourselves.  What is a binary relation all it is is a subset of a cross a binary relation on it on a settee.  Where does that word binary come from?  It just means that.  The relation has two part or has two elements each relation.  Each element of a Crosshair has is a visit ordered pair of two things. So that's where the binary comes from. It doesn't have anything to do with binary numbers or anything like that.  So how do we visualize a represent a relation there's a there's a few ways one is to just list out the the elements.  another way is to give a rule right so you could say something like let  r1b, defined  On a by you give a rule something like X relates to Y if and only if I don't know X.  / why is an integer?  I maybe we will you define this on z+ or something. So you just have to give it a rule.  Or just list out all of the elements, right? What would be some elements in this set? We would have  right to relates to 1.  examples  3 relates to 1/4 related to  and so on my PC.  once you have the rule you can start listing out the things okay now, so that's just a  Ordinary relation. Now, let's talk about what is an equivalence relation. It is a relation that follows these three rules reflexive symmetric and transitive reflexive just means that every element relates to itself.  Symmetric means that if element a relates to be than be also relates to a and transitive is if you have a release to be be released to see then you have a release to see and you can come up with relations that follow any subset of these rules. But if they follow all three then it's a special kind of relation called and equivalence relation.  Okay. So one way to say an equivalence relation is to say like we said before it's a relation that follows those three rules, but another way to formulate it, or maybe you like to see it as a consequence of an equivalence relation. Is that  The equivalence relation partitions whatever set you have into these disjoint nonempty subset.  Kind of like your group you have the set and you and you separate the set into groups and these groups are called equivalence classes. I have that up there.  equivalent classes  Okay, let's look at an example of what we did the other day.  We had this relation are it's on the set 0 1 * so this is the set of all finite length binary strings. And the relation was that two strings are related to each other if they have the same length.  So quickly, let's just kind of check off to see that it's an equivalence relation. We already did this before but let's just revisit it just to kind of get in the habit of checking all the three requirements.  reflexive  symmetric  transitive  okay.  Reflexive any any string will relate to itself because every string has the same number of symbols as itself, right? So in this particular case, it's easy to see that it is reflect.  Every string relates to itself now. What about symmetric?  if a has the same number of symbols as be  then it's clear that B has insane number of symbols has a right. So this is also symmetric and also transitive holds one string at the same length is another string and that string of the same length is another string than they all have the same length.  Okay, so just what kind of like a quick check to just remind ourselves that this relation is a equivalence relation to a consequence of having an equivalence relation is that now we can partition are set into equivalence classes. What are these equivalence classes look like well.  First of all, let's talk about how to denote the equivalence class.  So one nice property about equivalence classes is that every single element belongs to exactly one equivalent class. And so you can kind of think about an element inside of equivalence class that sort of like the the representative of that class.  Okay. So if for some element a if I do bracket Ace of our that is the equivalence class that contains a k instead of all ask such that ax is in the relation.  so for example  the string 0  it's equivalence class is all of the strings that have exactly one character. Right? So the equivalence class containing 0 is the set 0, 1 and noticed that the equivalence class containing 0 is the same as the equivalent class containing one and then another example is the equivalence class containing 0000 are is all of the strings that have exactly two characters. So you can kind of see that now you've partitioned the set of all binary strings into groups and each group contains all of the strings that have the same length.  Aetna questions  now  we're kind of going to get to a  very important equivalence relation and equivalent classes. We're going to be partitioning the  the set of all integers Okay, so  If you have an equivalence class that that means that you know, if you can partition is set into a cooler equivalence classes, that means that there is a equivalence relation that corresponds to it and vice versa. So if I give you this as the way to partition the set of all integers  What is the equivalence relation that gives you these equivalence classes?  Okay. Now we're all kind of jumping on this bandwagon.  I guess you know, it's kind of tempting.  to say  Hey because sometimes it works out but be is really the one that we want to.  Sayre so X and Y are related if they both have the same remainder when you divide by 4.  Any questions about that?  Okay, so I noticed that we have negative numbers in there, too. I guess what I wanted to say was  Okay.  so  this set here is equal to  zero sub  AR  if the equivalence class containing is 0 related to this sat bar.  Okay, sorry about that. So.  This is related to this relation are but since this relation is so common, and it's very important instead of calling the zero sub are we're going to just call this.  0 sub for and so if you see as little for down there that's talking about this particular equivalence relation. This one here.  Okay.  So this one would be equal to what?  100 and 1/4  Does that work?  Kind of a dumb number to choose right? Probably better to just choose one, right?  But remember, you know, you can use any representative of the set to talk about it quotes class.  day, and then this one would be  to all the numbers that are too much  that are congruent to two mod for and then three.  Noticed that we've divided the set of all integers into these four groups and we haven't missed any integers, right every integer belongs to exactly one of the groups.  Okay, so let's talk about how to talk about these things.  Now we all know about mod as like a binary operation right that takes two numbers a mod b and you know how to get the answer right and in computer science oftentimes the mod thing is written as a percentage sign, right so we know how to use it as a binary relation. This is going to be kind of how we how we tend to talk about it as an equivalence class. Okay. So for neamb in Z and some positive integer, and we say that a is congruent to b-mod m  That's that's like saying that A and B are contained in the same equivalence class mod an idea, so.  a few equivalent ways of saying that is that m / a - b-41  which is the same thing as saying that a minus B is some multiple of M. And then this is kind of like a new notation that maybe maybe you haven't seen before it's a with this like triple equal sign and this is the way the say this is  is congruent to  okay. So which of the following is true here 5 is congruent to 10035 is congruent to 1 mod 3 5 is congruent to 3-month 35 is congruent to negative 1 mod 3  or none of the above.  Okay good. So 5 is congruent to -1 mod 3. Well, that's what most of you guys are saying. Let's see if it's right. You know it one way to tell is to use  this definition  Okay.  so  is the following  true  3 divided 5 - -1  Is that true? Yes, right. So because that's true, then we can conclude that 5 is congruent to -1 - 3  Okay, any questions about that?  So this thing mod you can kind of think about it in two ways one is like the one you're used to which is a binary operation on two numbers or you use it like in this way. Where you talking about? How do two numbers relate?  When you separate the integers into equivalence classes mod M. Okay. So I claim that this is an equivalence relation. We we've kind of talked about it, but we haven't really proven it. So how would you go about proving this?  You need these three things to be true, right?  So let's actually go through the proof and not just check mark them off when we actually have a very nice.  Definition that we can use which is this one that I circled or even this one here.  This is going to be helpful and showing the the three conditions hold. Okay, reflexive why is  the this relation  reflection  so a  Is congruent let's just do it like this.  Emma divides A- a m always divide 0  therefore  hey is congruent to eh  Martin  for any a and that's really what you want another way to say it would be that.  a  right relates to a  Okay, how about symmetric suppose?  M divides  a-minus B  we're going to assume that a is congruent to b-mod am now we want to show that be a congruent to a model suppose and divides a minus B, then is it true that and divides B minus a  Yes, right.  Because be mine is a is just -8 - B and if M divided some number than it has to divide the the inverse also the negative.  Okay, so hey is congruent to b-mod m.  implies that b is congruent to a mod n  Okay, good transitive now.  suppose  a is congruent to b-mod am so m / a - be so how I said it here and suppose that b is congruent to see Maude m. So am also divides b - c  we want to conclude that and divides A- see how we going to do that.  Okay, good. We can actually write used like the multiple of the number.  rule, which is  this rule here right there exists some Q such that a minus B is a multiple of M. So that means that a minus B is equal to some q1 M & V - c is equal to some q2m and if you add these two equations together, right?  Add we get a - b + b - c is equal to q1 + Q2.  which means that a minus C is a multiple of  you fill in the details if you like any questions.  So this is good we have we've established that there. This is an equivalence relation.  So like I said before we're not going to subscript with our we're going to subscript with the actual number M. That is the  the the modulus or modulo amp  okay, so congruence mod and is equivalence relation to congruence classes are a sub and it's all of the integers such that all the integers such that a mod m is equal to a Smart in or another way to say it is that  hey is congruent to S. Mod an  Panthers is the set of all assets such that.  Good.  Okay. So for example when m is equal to 6, these are all the equivalence classes any questions about that. We already kind of saw this before zero sub 6 is all of the multiples of 6 1 sub sex is all the multiples of 6 + 1  Okay good.  okay, so in order to kind of  Add and subtract and multiply these things we have to make sure that these things commute with with these operations, right? It would be very nice if when you add it A and B and you took the modulo modulo M. Then it would just be like adding the to a mod M & B mod m  so  Is this true?  and the answer is  yes for adding and yes for multiplying now. If you guys want you can use this as a good exercise in and writing out a proof and showing that these these operations will always hold for Nea B&N.  exercise  proof these  identities  let's look at this example down here that I have.  This is  arithmetic on the integers modulo 3  So notice what happens I guess.  when we add  These these results are kind of just results that you would normally get if you just added the two numbers together. But now what happens when you add 1 + 2 is that you get three.  and so three is kind of out of the scope of the numbers right in between 0 and  Into and so what you want to do is just have add the two numbers and then and then mod by 3 after okay. So one plus two is three you mod by 3 and you get zero and so on two plus two is four you mod by three you get one and so on this will always work.  Okay, how about multiplying both 0 times anything is just going to be zero and we kind of have the same the same thing happening is that these numbers are the two numbers multiplied together and if you multiply 2 * 2 you get four.  Which is congruent to 1 mod 3.  Okay, let me just take a step back here something that is sort of common to do.  That I didn't really explicitly say.  Is that remember I said you could take any of the elements in each congruent in each conjugacy class and each equivalence class and use it as a representative. It's usually good to use the number in between 0 and M -1 as the number that is the representative. So for example, zero would be the representative of this class.  One would be the representative of this one, too.  3  4  + 5  and so it's not wrong. If you put other numbers in there. It just this is the kind of the most standard way to do it.  pranks  and in fact, these are the numbers that you get when you do the operation mod like you're doing it on a computer.  Okay, are there any questions so far?  Where's that?  liquor question  Okay, how about raising to a power? What is 5 to the 5th module 08?  How do you how do you do this?  Now you can just plug it into a computer calculator.  I don't even know what V to V is.  So big number and then divide out by 8 and take the remainder. What's another way that we could do it? Maybe that takes a little bit less work?  Use the multiplication rule over and over again.  so V to V mod eight is just  5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5  my day, right?  Remember what we said is that multiply multiplication commutes with the mod function. So this becomes  V mate  x 5 Mod 8  agent  and so you can kind of like do it in steps. So first combine the first two  What is this become what's 5 - 8 * 5 - 8?  one one right because you get  25 mod 8  and that's equal to one.  That kind of makes sense.  Pic of 25 is 1 bigger than 24.  Okay.  I guess I guess I should have written this better.  This is fine. You guys get the idea. So now I have one mate 8. Let's just write it like that one. Mod 8 x 5 Mod 8, you know these two together give you five money.  Okay, that's fine.  Now, let's bring these guys down.  5 - 8 * 5 mi madre again is again Mach 1 mod 8  and then one mate 8 x 5 Mod 8.  Is it again 5 Monday?  Peso equal to 5 right because work with thing about this mod function as the actual like mod function. You're familiar with on the computer. Right? So we we we want the result to be some number in between 0 and 7 anybody have a calculator.  does this thing have like a oh here go 5 raised to the 5 is  3125 okay, so I claim that it's five miles is congruent to 5 Mod 8. So subtract 5 and you get 3120 / 8 and you get 390 any questions about that.  I guess I'm just a little just a little strange because I mean looking at this normal.  If I kind of device, yeah.  Yeah, I guess I should be a little bit careful here and maybe maybe say instead this thing whole thing.  Yeah, maybe I should be a little bit more careful.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I think you're right in that.  instead  we should write it as  5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5  mod hate this is really what we're doing is we're doing 5 x 5 Mod 8 * 5 * 5 * 5  Mod 8 this whole thing not 8 rank.  That's kind of how many maybe this is a better way to to visualize it 5 times 5 Mod eight times and then you can do it like this five times V mate 8 x 5 Mod 8  This whole thing my date.  And then you just get 1 * 1 * 5.  You got five. I think that would be maybe a better way. I'm sorry. If I did it the other way. I might be a little bit more confusing. But any other questions  Okay now it's your turn.  What is the last digit of 2018 race to the 2018?  Take a few minutes to do this write it out on your paper. Talk to your neighbor. Don't just guess I want you to think about it. Don't take out your Wolfram Alpha calculator. This number is too big to fit on your calculator right cell.  How would you go about doing this type of problem?  Ready to go. If you need a hand or are kind of stock that just raised her hand and I can kind of help you with maybe some of the first few steps.  You just noticed that like the what I'm asking for is the last digit the last digit of a number is whatever that number is mod, 10, whatever the the result is of taking that number mod 10.  Okay.  So a lot of people are saying d  don't honestly I have no idea what the answer to this problem is.  But there's a good way to find out if anybody have a strategy that they think works.  Okay.  So you're trying to do this, right?  2018 to the 2018 mod 10 right is equal to 8 to the 2018 mod 10.  Frank's, okay.  Square  So if I'm 64 Montana Sports there before.  Okay.  So this is equal to 64 to the what 1,000 +?  9  my 10 coming this certainly is true just because these two numbers are are equivalent, right?  No, but then you could go like this, right? This is congruent to 4 to the 1009.  Martin that's true  Did anybody find a pattern?  What time do we keep doing it but now 1009 is not divisible by 2 anymore.  Okay, we can keep on doing that. That's true. That would definitely work.  Comment over here.  power pot  Okay, it's going to yeah, it's going to you're going to find a pattern if you just keep on doing it, right? Maybe that's not obvious question or comment every four Cycles.  Let's take a look.  Okay. Yeah, it may not be completely obvious. But  will do like a  an experiment and then we'll kind of try to reason why it does this. Okay, so  8 to the 1 mod is equal to 8, right?  8 squared mod 10 is equal to what?  For right because it's 64 mod 10.  Okay, how about eight cubed? Mod 10.  Do I actually need to compute 8 cubed?  you can kind of use our previous work, right this is equal to  8 squared times 8 mod 10 and we've already seen that we can kind of multiply within the the mod operator. Right? So this is equal to 4 * 810 which is 32 mod 10.  Which is 2 or 10 or 2?  Okay, and then 8th to the 4th?  Martin  turns out to be 6. I don't know which way you want to do that for * 4/8 * 2 whatever you like write 6.  And then 8 to the 5th.  My tent is what 6 x 8 is 48. So that's 8 now noticed that we are back to where we started here. So it only makes sense that the that the pattern will repeat exactly as it did before right cuz we're at 8. How do you get to the next the next number in the sequence if you just * 8 + mod 10, so if you keep on doing that give her get to where you started you'll repeat the pattern so  8  to the  to any number  I guess we should start with 8 to the  no.  I want to start like this.  any number eight to the  hero  8 to the 1 is now going to be equal to 8 to the 5 is now going to be equal to 8 to the what 9 right?  And so is equal to any number.  8 to the whatever any number let's say k such that.  K is congruent to  1 mod 4  I should have said the other way think that way is better such that K mod 4 is equal to 1 right?  And so all we have to do is figure out what congruence what equivalent class is 2018 in mod for.  to write  2018 mod  4 is equal to 2.  That means that what 8 to the 2018 is equal to?  Are Montana sorry?  Is equal to 4.  I guess I should.  Try not doing the best job with notation. Mod 10.  110  Okay, so this is the answer. How do we do?  Okay, so I want to just do kind of like a little bit of a  an overview of what happened here is that whenever you do this sequence of taking Powers, you're always going to run into a cycle like this every time it doesn't matter what it is and the cycle has a upper bound on how long it can be right because the only really the the maximum number of  answers that you can have in this right that maximum number of different integers you can have in here is going to be M -1  because those are the only numbers that can result when you take the whatever integer mod n  Okay. So let's song Let's Move Along to another quicker question that maybe you guys have been asking yourselves.  We know that addition and multiplication. They were right. I guess you guys can on your own proof.  Why they work?  Which of the following is also true? Is it true that?  A-minus B mod M kind of commutes with the mod operator division or exponentiation do any of these work or do some of them work or do does one of them work here in there?  Okay, so if you say more than one of the above, which ones are you talking about?  Hey.  It works right is good.  What else?  see also  What do we just show we just showed that?  2018 to the  2018  Mod 10.  Is equal to 4.  What's 8 to the 8 mod 10?  Text rent.  We've already kind of showing that she doesn't work the way they may be the way that you would want it to so.  She doesn't work and be what about be? Well, you're not even guaranteed to have an integer when you divide.  Hope he doesn't work either paid us any questions about that.  Maybe you guys can justify why a Works using the  the definition of mod  Okay, so  Here's some more counterexamples that you guys can look at.  The counter example to why a / B mod and doesn't work. 16/2 mod 10 is 816 mod 10 / 2 mod 10 is Right 6/2, which is 3 so there's another reason why it doesn't work.  Okay. Well, we'll pick up on this on Friday.  We'll look at some applications on where to use this kind of stuff.  Hey, Ben.  San Diego forecast "
