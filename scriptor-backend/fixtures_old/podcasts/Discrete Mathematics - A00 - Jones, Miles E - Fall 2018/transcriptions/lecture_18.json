  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  already  let's begin good morning class if you need to see me about signing your  Exam in order to gain access to it. Then you can come do that after class. Okay?  Okay, so what are we doing today?  Well, what have we done so far regular induction and structural induction. The next thing we're going to do is something called strong induction and will  can I see how that works on a few examples?  Renew strong induction to prove correctness of identities and inequalities properties of algorithms properties of geometric constructions. I think today we're just going to do  Identities I guess we'll just one of those one of the examples we'll do it is kind of like an algorithm you'll see how that kind of works and the geometric constructions. Maybe I don't think we'll get to that today.  Okay.  This is like the next sort of topic is talking about functions. And so I don't know if we'll really get to it today. But that's just the kind of show you what's what's to come.  Okay.  I guess we are going to look at mistakes in proofs too, but we'll get to that. Okay, so you guys have noticed I made a I may have made a mistake on this slide last time.  so  discuss the mistake that I made was  I made it for the purpose to just make sure that you guys were paying attention to the  to the right answer right now. So here's the idea here is and it's good that we go over this again because this is sort of an important set the set of all binary strings. Okay, and one way to describe the set is with this recursive definition. You have your bases step. You have your empty string in there and then you have your recursive step if you have a string then w0 and WW1 or both in there.  How many strings are formed using the basis Step at at most in applications?  que pasa  What are you guys say?  right  the correct answer was not d  I must have just seen that to the K and  thought it was something right. I mean no I did I saw it and it was all planned out just to make sure you guys are paying attention. That's that's my story. Hey, so the answer here is what two to the K - 8 + 1  -1  oops  Hey, let's check it out for some values of K.  And this should be k  Play but that's okay. So k + 2 to the k + 1 - 1 + let's just do.  01 star  after K steps  Okay, so we have K is equal to 0 after 0 steps.  We get what 2 to the 0 + 1 - 1 so that's one and what is this? We just have the empty string.  Say when ks12 the k+ 1-1, so that's two to the form to the 2-1 4 - -3 + in here. We get the empty string 0 and 1.  When K is too we get what?  7 and we get empty string 01.  0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 K. So it seems to seems to line up nicely any questions about this.  I should have been a 1-1. Thank you.  I was just making sure you're paying attention there.  Crystal 7  Okay good.  so  Where is this notation come from this star here is called cleaning star.  And it's it's an operation you can do on a set and basically it makes a bunch of words out of characters in your set. I guess informally.  The cleaning star basically makes all possible words using elements of your set as characters. It's basically if my set is 0 1 this will make all possible strings of zeros and ones if my set had had more characters than they would be Different Strings & Sol on in general.  you can you could Define it to be the empty string is in a star if you was in a star and V is in a if you was in a star and V is element of a then UV is in a star and noticed that this is exactly the recursive step that we had for the specific example, right we said if you is in 01 star  Then you zero is in there. And you one is in there where 0 and 1 right are the elements of a case. If you can sort of see how it is at this definition is applied to specific example.  Okay.  so  What did I want to do here?  So  Nevermind. Okay now for something completely different except not actually but we're going to frame it in a different thing. They were going to talk about a game this game Nim. It has a lot of different ways to play it. So we're going to present one specific way.  So you have two players and you have two equal piles of whatever jelly beans beans.  Candy, I don't know money, right just to pile to have the same number the two players take turns picking picking from one pile. Okay, so I can pick as many beans or as many coins or whatever, but they all have to come from the same pile and I have to take at least one.  Okay.  The player who removes the last Jelly Bean wins the game.  Okay.  Who has a strategy?  That guarantees a win. Maybe we should play it.  What are you going to say?  Yeah, let's play.  Okay, I'll go first.  Okay, there's me. And then there's the class. Let's say that we're going to start with v.  I guess it doesn't matter.  All that matters if there are two piles it doesn't matter which ones in front of which one.  Play Let's make these different colors.  doesn't really matter but  Okay, I'll go first. I'm going to take one red bean.  Now you guys go. What are you guys want to do?  Take all the other pile.  Just one, okay.  Okay, my turn now I'm going to take these two from the green pile. Now. You're go what are you guys going to do?  Northlake to from the red  Take 3 from the red.  Okay, who wants to take three and wants to take two  You sure.  All right. I'll take one from the red Pyle.  pictures from the green  Take only one from the green. All right, so now I'm like pretty much screwed right? I'll just take that green one and you guys can  you guys win?  Wow, good job guys.  You almost lost though.  No, I know I just said.  Do you guys get the kind of the strategy now who has the winning strategy player one or player two player to write? What was the strategy?  Yeah, do the same as the player one, but put it in the opposite pile. And what is the result of that strategy?  Right salt but okay. So I start my sash start with and jelly beans on either side.  Right, you want the tupile to have an even number of beans right? You want them to have the same number actually, right and that state of the game.  If you're in that state player 2 has an advantage. So the strategy is to always make the game be in that state at every turn right you always make it so that there are equal.  Okay, so let's look at this in more detail.  When n is equal to one who wins.  Play R1 no matter what player to no matter what or it depends on what move they make.  Or if you press D, then I'll explain what the rules are again. But I hope that that little example helped.  No, or yes.  well  perfect knowledge or perfect strategy  No, they don't have perfect strategy, but they they have to follow the rules.  Yes to have to take a positive number of beans but they can't take they can only take from one pile.  question  Yeah.  see  Okay. So for these three people to people.  Free People  So the idea of the game.  Go back.  There's two piles of beans that have an equal number of beans first player takes as many beans as he wants from either pile has to be a positive number then player gets to do the same.  person who takes the last Bean Wednesday game  and now I've confused 10 more people.  Buy that explanation.  All right. Come see me after class if you want to talk more about the rules.  sup  What are the possible moves for player one either he takes the red bean or the green bean?  If you takes the red bean, the only thing player two can do is he's forced to take the green bean right and vice versa. If he takes the green bean player to is forced to take the red bean so player who wins even if he doesn't want to even if you're playing with your little brother and you're like, you know, he's always losing I'll let him win this time. There's no possible way that you can unless you don't follow the rules are to always win in this scenario.  questions about that  Okay.  How about now? How about if there are two beans?  Who wins this one?  Is it possible for player to Toulouse?  Yes, right.  Care one could take one bean player to could wipe out an entire stack and then player one could take the last Bean.  Nobody takes two beans at the very beginning then player to can take the the two bins on the other side, right?  So  where's my thing?  Okay, so  the strategy and you guys figured this out is player two takes the same amount of beans as player one, but from the opposite pile the game reduces to the same setup with but with fewer jelly beans it's kind of the idea that we were going for. This is like a perfect structure scenario for induction.  Let's see how that's going to work.  Okay, let's first Define what is strong induction?  It's a lot like regular induction, but the inductive step the inductive hypothesis assumes a lot more so  Let's have regular induction over here.  Would be verify.  Pier One  Frank and then prove for all K greater than equal to 1 P of K implies P of k + 1  Right, I guess this is starting at 1 we start at 0 of whatever. This is starting at 1 so strong induction. It assumes pfk. Just like regular induction, but it also assumes every single other statement P of I in between 1 and K.  She was all of that stuff in order to prove pfk + 1.  That's the basically the only difference it turns out that the proof like the actual structure of the proof is a lot like regular induction.  The main thing that you have to worry about is setting it up setting up your assumptions correctly.  Okay.  So let's hold off for questions until we kind of see it in action. So you can understand why this would be necessary at certain times.  Okay, so for nin?  Let's prove that this winning strategy that this strategy will be a winning strategy for any number of beans that you start with.  Okay. So basic step, I guess this is the this is the claim.  The second player can always guarantee a win.  4  any number  a beans  and such that  And is greater than equal to one right? You can't really play the game if there are no beans so we'll say that's not a it's not a valid basis step want to show for any number of I should say and in each pile.  Be 10 in each pile.  And greater than equal to one. So an equals one is our base step basis step. We want to show if piles each have one then the second player can't win. We've already actually established that.  induction step  Let K be a positive integer. Okay, in other words let K be greater than or equal to 1 this part of the proof is equivalent in it's like the same thing that you do in the regular induction proof.  This is where the strong induction diverges. This is where it gets different. You have to include this statement.  Assume that the induction assume that the statement is true for every value m in between 1 and K.  Okay. So what does that mean? That means we're assuming that P1 is true P2 is true P3 is true before it's true all the way up 2K.  Okay.  Then we want to show the second player has a winning strategy.  Okay, so let's let's do this proof step-by-step. I want you to see the structure so that you can reproduce it.  Okay.  So let's start.  Here, let me actually.  Do it this way.  Let's do it this way.  Okay.  basis  step  Okay.  when and is equal to 1  player 2  wins  No matter what.  Play that's from a previous argument.  Okay inductor step.  Let K be greater than equal to 1/4 fix K to be greater than equal to what you want to start with some K. And then the argument is based on that arbitrary k  for all  integers  I am such that.  1 less than or equal to M less than or equal to K.  assume  assume that P of them is true and P of M in this case. Is that player two can win when there's M jellybeans in each pile.  Player two can win.  When there are M Jelly Beans?  in each pile  Okay. I just wanted to to write it out again so that you guys write it with me because this is like the weird new part that we never did before in regular induction and noticed that this n matches with the thing that we're going to poop.  Okay, let's do the proof.  Daiso  We want to show.  Player two can win.  when  there are how many beans in each pile?  Kate plus one. We've assumed it all the way up from one 2K now we want to prove k + 1  each pile. Okay good, so  suppose  there are K plus one beans.  write in each pile  stop  suppose  suppose  player one takes  let's say how many beads does he take? Let's say he takes  What variable what's a good variable for us now? Let's say he takes eye beans.  from  the first  pile  without loss of generality if you take it from the second pilot, you just take it from the other one. Okay suppose player one what happened to my thing?  Takes I beams from the first pile.  The strategy is that player to take cybies from the second pile, right?  Okay, I'll just kind of say over here in parentheses that I have to be strictly greater than one us to be strictly greater than less than greater than the one right because I said you have to take a positive amount. Okay.  now  there are k + 1 - eye beads.  in each pile  right  now  What do we know about k + 1 - I?  It's between 0 and K, right?  So we need to treat both of those as separate cases whether or not it's zero or in between 1 and K. Don't let me give myself a little bit more room.  insert a new slide  Okay.  Okay, so case one.  k + 1 - I is  is equal to 0 if that's the case then player 2 has already one, right?  Because that means player one wiped out one of the piles and player to just took the entire other pile.  Case 2K + 1 let me do it. This way one is less than or equal to k + 1 - I is less than or equal to K.  Now notice that this value is exactly the range that I've already assumed so by the strong inductive hypothesis.  Player 2 has a winning strategy.  4  k + 1 - I beans  any pile  why can I ask why can I bring that back? It's exactly what I had here for all integers and where m is in this range right in between 1 and K noticed that k + 1 - I is in that rain. So we've assumed that he can win with that amount of beans.  questions  So because this is a subtlety is that in my inductive hypothesis or the inductive step. I've only assumed that this thing is true.  4 m in between 1 and K. I haven't assumed that it's true for 4 when m is equal to zero. The game is not really defined 40 beans, right, so  I can't use the it strong inductive hypothesis if m is not in that exact range.  Any other questions?  Okay good.  Okay, how does this all connect to these other ones? Well, all of these recursions that you see up here notice something about them that that they all share in common.  They all Define what it means to be on N by what it means to be a 10-1, right?  N + n - 1 write n + n - 1 sometimes you have recursions that go back farther than just and -1. Okay. So all of these we could use regular induction because you just have to go one step at a time. Okay, if you go more than one step that you have to use strong induction.  And when I say have to you guys are going to get back at me at that because I'm going to show you that.  You can actually use regular induction for any problem. You could use strong induction for but in this class and  I guess.  To make the problem more readable you should use.  Okay, let's move on to Fibonacci numbers. Have you guys heard of these before?  Okay, so they are a recursively defined sequence.  people defined them in different ways, depending on where they start we're going to Define them in this way where half of 0 is 0 half of one is one and then all the rest of the  numbers in the sequence. You can build by doing this recursion that F of n is equal to ever end - 1 + 7 - 2  Okay, so there's a reason that the Fibonacci numbers haven't come up until now.  It's because we can't use regular induction to prove things about them can't.  But we're going to need strong induction. What's the clue?  That tells you that we need strong induction.  You go back more than one step exactly noticed that in order to know something about and I need to know something about 10-2, which is more than one step.  Let's see how that works out.  Okay, so what are some sample values?  Let's just write a table.  Hey, so this is an in. This is FN. Then we have white 0 1 0 + 1 is 1 1 + 1 is 2 1 + 232 + 353 + 585 + 8 is 13 and someone just the sum the the previous two numbers in the sequence.  Where's the next question how quickly do these values grow?  This is what we're going to answer today.  Where  oh good point. Okay, and I should say something about that.  this  this inequality is really only talking about when am I allowed to use this recursion? I'm only allowed to use it when n is greater than or equal to 2 when it's smaller than to I have to use the base cases.  But we're going to show today. Is that the Fibonacci Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially how we going to do that?  strong induction  So here's the claim.  The answer Bonacci number is going to be greater than or equal to 1.5 to the end for every integer n greater than equal to 11.  Okay.  Which means that 1.5 to the end is an exponential function right in the Fibonacci numbers are going to be higher than that exponential function for all numbers greater than 11. So it's going to be 4  and get really really big the Fibonacci numbers are going to be bigger than the 1.5 to the end. It's actually has to do a lot with that homework problem you did with the Big O notation, but we're not going to get into the the details of that.  Okay. So before we begin this proof, I want to give you a disclaimer. There is a mistake in this proof and we're going to go through it and see where it comes up. Okay?  Okay, so let's go through it. You know the kind of the the way we set up the strong induction.  Okay, basis step first we want to show that F of 11 is actually greater than or equal to 1.5 to the 11 question.  Why do we choose 11 does anybody know?  Yeah, it's not true for 10.  Oh, that's a good question. Why do we come up with this theorem?  so  let me try to just briefly kind of give you some reasons. Have you ever heard of the golden ratio? Okay. So the way that the Fibonacci numbers grow is actually  proportional to whatever the golden ratio is raised to the N power and the golden ratio is somewhere around 1.6. So it should be the case that the Fibonacci numbers are bigger than 1.5 and we picked 1.5 because it's kind of like the easiest most simple number that's less than the golden ratio would want to pick one because one to the end of always one and so 1.5 is kind of like the most simple thing.  Indiana with 1.5. It's enough to do the two claim that it grows exponentially. So so kind of the simplest way to show that.  Okay, good question.  Okay, so just like we did before we're going to fix K to be an integer with K greater than or equal to 11. This is like exactly what we did for regular induction, right you fix K and then you prove something about k  Okay, this is the new bit right the new bit of information that we need or the new kind of line that we need. We need to assume that for all J. I guess I used em in the other case, but you just use another variable for all J.  With j and between 11 and K that are statement is true.  Okay, so maybe something that would be good to remind ourselves. Is that this statement here? We can think of as P of n?  Okay, and I'm trying to prove that P of n is true for all n greater than equal to 11.  this statement here is saying  P of 1 and P of 2 +.... And P of K  that's this is like a fancy way of saying this statement.  right because we're saying that basically pfj which is  All these colors now this thing here is Piaget.  They were saying pmj is true for 1 4 2 4 3 4 4 4 every number in between 1 and 11 and K. Sorry. I just realized what I did there.  1112  big questions about that  Okay, good now.  Let's do the bases step. We want to show that F of loving is greater than or equal to 1.5 to the 11. You can just do this by inspection half of 11 is 89.5 to the 11 is around 86 so.  Now we'll do our in inductive step are strong inductive step.  Guy fix it. Okay to be an integer assume that for all J with j in between 11 and K that our statement is true. That's this is the setup.  Now want to show that statement is true about ffk plus one basically want to show P of k+ one we want to show this type of k + 1 is greater than equal to 1.5 to the k + 1.  Okay. So the idea behind this is to use the recursive nature of the Fibonacci numbers in order to prove this to be correct?  Okay, so  this is what we're going to do.  FK + 1 is equal to F of K.  + f of K - 1  Now by my inductive hypothesis F of K is greater than 1.5 to the K & F M K - 1 is greater than 1.5 to the K - 1 so this whole thing has got to be greater than or equal to 1.5 to the k + 1.5 to the K - 1  okay, this is coming from the  strong the inductive hypothesis  Okay, will do a little bit of algebra.  Okay, this is equal to 1.5 * 1.5 +.  1 write 1.52 K - 1 you can factor out a k - 11.5 you get this this is equal to 1.5 to the x 2.5.  Right, that's greater than or equal to.  So I want to affect the K - 1 that's greater than equal to 1.5 to the K - 1 * 2.25.  Which is equal to 1.5 to the K - 1 * 1.5 squared.  And that's equal to 1.5 to the k + 1.  And you'll often see this type of like sequence of inequalities and inequalities where you start from one side and try to get to the other side. Okay questions about the algebra.  supposed to recognize where you going from t120 to do a manipulation did so one thing that maybe you could do if you were doing this problem on your own and you kind of got stuck at that point is to start from what you're trying to prove which is this what your results should be and work backwards and see if you can get it in terms of  K - 1 so you can factor out a 1.5 squared and then you have a 1.5 to the K - 1 and then you can just maybe see that 2.5 is bigger than 2.25.  Okay. So this is the this is just what I wrote.  But there is a flaw I told you that which value of K.  makes this argument invalid  And it's this argument that we're talking about.  Hi, everybody is just jumping on the bandwagon here. That's fine. Okay, so I claim that this is valid for all K greater than or equal to 11, right? But what happens when K is actually equal to 11.  right  This is your problem right here.  I'm assuming that fcm 10 is greater than 1.5 to the 10.  I know we didn't compute those values, but that's actually not true, right?  Shop, we have a problem.  a problem that easily fixed  Does anybody have any ideas of what we could do?  Okay, change all the 11th to 12 since yeah, basically that's that's what we're going to do in some way we're going to do is we're going to have two bases steps for 11 and 4:12, and then we can start at 12.  Because we know of f11 is true so we could use that. Okay, so this is the right answer. It's not actually true for 11. So let's redo the whole proof.  We're going to have two bases steps.  411 + 4/12  just write them out and you can see by inspection that 89 is bigger than 86.5 and 144 is bigger than 129.7. That's it. Okay, so that's good.  now  now do the same thing. There's going to be one subtle difference. Is that when we fixed k?  We want to make sure that case starts at 12, right because it's K starts at 11, then we'll run into that same problem.  So so this is the thing that changes it turns out that this assumption here.  Doesn't change you still wanted you still want to assume that. It's true for 4 from 11 up to K.  Okay, then.  The algebra is exactly the same as what we did before remember. The only difference that we have is  we're assuming that it works for K greater than or equal to 12 and let's just kind of go through a few steps of this induction argument or the few kind of  implications  let's start with k is equal to 12.  right, then F of 12 + 1 is equal to  Half of 12 plus half of 11 that's this first part.  What do we know about F 12 and F 11?  They're the basic steps. We've already proven those we've hardly proof hard prove in those to be true. Right so we can we can do all the algebra and show that is true for f13.  K is equal to 13 then we have a 13 + 1 is equal to 1/2 of 13 + out of 12 right now from the previous 13 now we can prove it reported about 11 12 and 13.  So we can use the statement is true for 12 and 13 to prove that it's true for F-14 and so on so maybe have an idea how that goes.  Okay, so  I know we just have a few more minutes left. I just wanted to kind of  Remind ourselves. What are the different flavors of induction that we've seen? We have mathematical induction. This is something about proving one step at a time using K to prove k + 1  We have structural induction where this is basically using the recursive structure of asset to prove certain identities about it to prove certain invariance or two proofs some certain qualities about all of the elements of the set using the recursive structure.  And then strong induction, which we showed was PT of 1 and P of 2 +... And pfk.  implies pfk + 1  Okay, we we don't really have any time left. So on Friday, I'll show you short of the  I will compare strong induction to regular induction and show that strong induction is not actually any stronger. It's just the name.  Okay. See you guys Friday.  I need to sign my o okay.  here, let me  can you see San Diego podcast? "
