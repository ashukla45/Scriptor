  "Full Transcript": "Broadcast, good morning, everyone. Happy Friday.  Yeah.  so  did anybody look at any more into this video?  I want to show you guys his exclusive or gate because I thought it was pretty cool that we saw the and gate you know, and it was like he used it to like short circuit itself, right? If you only press one of them and if you press both of them, it short-circuited the short circuit. It's kind of like a cool thing.  so exclusive or  right has these values right? So if he if he knocks down zero Domino's doesn't knock down either side then you get a zero, but if he knocks down one or the other than the last Domino should fall, but if he knocks down both of them, it shouldn't fall.  How would you create something like this?  I thought that his his setup was really ingenious.  I don't have this sound but  all right.  See if if he gets to it.  So, okay. So sometime later. Here we go.  And here it is.  What in the world did he create?  So like if you just hit the one side, then you get like the The Dominoes to kind of come around and then knock the the other one over. The other side does the same thing cuz it's symmetric both of them. Then it like cancels itself out and then it doesn't hit the one over. So I just thought it was kind of clever if you if you are interested.  Do we talk about a half adder?  Yeah, so you can make a half hour with and Anna exclusive or gate. So he makes a half adder out of out of these Domino's and then he hires like hundreds of people to create a domino calculator in like a huge gymnasium with like 10,000. Domino's does just like a bunch of half adder strung together and it's pretty impressive. I think but it's some it's kind of silly at the same time, you know, because we can we can add these things other things but I think it just is a good way to show you that you can do this type of arithmetic this type of Boolean logic with inanimate objects.  Okay, so you guys can.  It's just called Domino.  addition, that's what the name of the  Video is if you want to look at it.  Okay, so let's get my clicker thing going.  Go.  and let's get started with lecture Okay, so  Today or learning goals are at the end of the day. Hopefully we'll be able to  take us to take an English sentence and parse it into a propositional propositional variables and Boolean operators Casey what that means we're going to talk about what is a truth table how to build one. We're going to look at well-known truth tables for things like a negation conjunction disjunction excetera.  We're going to evaluate truth tables on a compound proposition. So she's going to put these things together. So this is kind of like the those circuits I gave you a in the homework, you'll see that it follows kind of from this kind of stuff. So we're going to Define what it means to be a conditional statement. It's a type of Boolean operator, and we're going to negated and do all this stuff.  And at the end of the class we might not get to it, but we're going to talk about what does it mean for a collection of propositions to be consistent or collect a collection of operations?  Okay. So in computers were talking about these logic gates where we we have zeros in ones and we talked about a few of them right the and gave the exclusive or gate 2 or the inverter and we string them together to get a desired output. Maybe it's the the sum of the two binary numbers right that would that would use a half adder or a full adder or something like that. Maybe it's just I don't know just to tell which one if there exists a one or if there exists a zero, so just existence.  Okay, so  we're going to shift from zeros and ones into true and false. It's okay. So this is the idea zero is off. So that's false and one is on so it's true now, honestly, you could you could describe this whole Theory using it the other way if you if you if you really want it but this is sort of the the general way that we all accept is that zero is false in one is true. And so that's the way we're going to be doing.  But it's kind of arbitrary in a in a weird way if you if you can if you can understand that.  Hey sir, this thing here is called the truth table.  And generally what you do is you have two columns or you have as many columns as there are variables, right? So in this case, we have two variables p and Q and you write down all possible combinations. Now when we were doing binaries, we generally started with the zeros and then all the ones when you do truth tables, you generally start with all the truth and then you go false is so kind of like the order is Switched, but it shouldn't matter.  So there are four possible combinations of true-false with the with a p and Q and let's go through the these three operate operations.  Okay. So this one is or it's like this little the little V is or now. What is or mean? That means that either p4q is true.  Take this one's and so this is p and Q.  Are true.  and the way I remember and it's because this thing kind of looks like a a and then exclusive or is  no, this is not exclusive or  yeah, this is exclusive or so, exclusive or  one way to say it is p and Q are different.  Another way to say is that P is true or Q is true but not both so we can describe it in many ways in English, but the definition that we're going to be using is this truth table definition. This is how we describe it. Okay, so we're going to be going back and forth between the definition based on the truth table and also the English definition.  Okay, so here's some definitions. We want to bring with us throughout this lesson. So a proposition is just a sentence that is either true or false but not both.  Okay.  I like pizza.  Does a proposition it happens to be true, right?  I  I'm from the planet Mars.  also a proposition  also happens to be true  not just happens to be false. A proposition doesn't have to be true. It's just a sentence that has a truth value propositional variable so variables that represent propositions, okay.  So instead of just saying that sentence over and over again, I can just say that whole sentence is pee and it and it holds a truth value. It's just a variable so, you know it could either be true or false.  Compound propositions just basically take propositions and put them together using these Boolean operators and such.  And the truth table we saw this already. So we'll we'll see it again.  Okay, so  We have all of these Gates and how do they all look in terms of the truth table? We kind of already put this up there, but he was just another  a relationship between the gates and the and the truth table  Okay, so  let's get started on our first clicker question.  Remember that the frequency?  is a b  Okay, so  remember that in a truth table?  We need to have every single possible combination of Truth and false has that are variables could possibly have right. So how many rows how many possible combinations of Truth and false? Do you need in order to express every single?  combination  Are we kind of have a few competing viewpoints here?  Check watching the election results, you know.  alright, so  any discussion anybody have any comments about this?  Is what?  None of the above. Okay. Well if it's none of the above then what should it be?  2 ^ 3 8  why date because you have three variables and each variable has two options that could either be true or false. So two options for the first one x 2 for the second one x to the third one so they should be eight questions about that.  Okay good.  Okay. So how do we feel in these rows? We have the input you have all the inputs and then you do the output. So in what order do you do these things the and the oars and the negations and all the stuff while on page 11 in Rose and it'll tell you the order of operations generally will try to put in parentheses where they matter so that the order of operations is is not ambiguous. But if it if they don't appear then go by the order in Rose.  Okay, good. So  So truth tables you can use them to kind of figure out how a compound proper his proposition behaves but you can also Define a compound proposition by is truth table. That's kind of what I was saying before the exclusive or for example is defined by how it how an axon truth values.  Okay, so  Hear my eight rows of p q and R. And what I want to do is fill out this part here.  Okay. So one way to do that is to for each combination. You just plug it in and you do some evaluation you do you you figure it out. For example for true true and true. Well, I know that P or Q this the first part is true and P or r that part is true. So both of those propositions are true. So and there's an and operator between them so that should be true.  so  other than or sorry.  It's still true.  Okay, so  you could do that for each one of them another way to do this, which I like is to make a few more rows and use those to help you out.  What should we call him? Thank you. So let's make the call on P or Q.  Okay, so I won't draw all these things. I'll just come try them in. So this is this is this is true. Whenever P or Q are both true true true. If one of them is true one of them through here and true and then this is when it's false.  How about P or r?  True true true true. This one is true. Then you have a false here and it true here and a false year.  Okay, so now we can use those two things and find them the middle column is going to be true whenever.  Whenever either side is true.  any questions  like  like a logic gates car precedent for future wife. How do we deal with that situation? Like for example, if we had this whole thing and then we had the negation case. How do we human into a couple of different route de bordados at work? Can we add it to the end?  Like a personal playlist with multiple combinations of different you connected to each other. How do we prepare?  Oh, you need to First translate the circuit into a propositional sentence.  and to do that  it's sort of like a sequence of things you need to do. Like for example, if there was a negation before the operator, right then you kind of negate the whole thing or if it's after then you negate.  I guess I guess if it's after like a binary operator, then you would negate the the whole operator right? But if it's before then you negate just the just the letter I think so.  Yeah, I guess you probably just have to like play around with it and see how it goes.  All right. How about this one?  Consider this compound proposition. It's not  parentheses, not P or not Q  Okay, so we could plug in values one row at a time like we did before or we can make some new columns. I like making new columns.  I think it makes it a little bit easier to do it's more step-by-step. Okay, so what's not pee not pee is  False false true true not Q is false true-false true and not P or not Q. Well, that's only that's when either one of not pee or not QR.  True rent. So this be false true true true and then you just negate that.  true false false false  Does that look familiar?  Have you seen that before? Yes, just look familiar.  What is it?  for 2  to compound propositions. I have the same True Values in all possible cases are called logically equivalent.  Which compound proposition is logically equivalent to?  I'm not going to attempt to say this. Not not not.  Not quantity, not P or not Q.  I guess that's good.  Okay good.  okay, this one has its and right because it's and  If both p and Q are true they may get true. And otherwise you get false.  Okay any questions?  Okay, so we talked about tautology and contradiction in the homework.  Tautology is a proposition that's always true compound proposition. That's always true. No matter what truth values you put in for its variables and a contradiction is always false no matter what you put in. Okay. So which one of these is a tautology  Okay, we're saying p and not-p.  No pee or not pee that's tea.  Okay.  What's up?  Let's take a look here.  So I'm just going to write it up here pay or not pee.  Okay, so  True or not. True or false? That's true. Okay good.  False or true? That's true. Ology.  Are there any questions about that?  Logically equivalent means that they have the same truth tables or they have the same values in the last column of the truth table.  okay, it just basically means that any  assignments of truth values you give to the variables will be the same in both cases.  Whenever one of them is true the other ones true whenever one of those false the other ones falls for every single combination.  Okay are all compound propositions either tautologies or contradictions. We've kind of seen this already. We've seen some that are not and those ones are called contingencies a sort of saw that and hopefully  Okay.  so  Now, let's go to translation. Okay. So this is something that takes them practice to do or maybe you've seen this before and it comes naturally to you. We're going to instead of thinking about p and Q as actual just variables that hold true and false values. You can think about them as English sentences that still hold true and false values ksop is going to be the statement. The message is scanned for viruses and Kilby the statement. The message was sent from an unknown system.  Okay. So how do I represent the statement? The message was sent from an unknown system, but it was not scan for viruses.  But we don't have a butt operator doing.  Is that a proctologist would be a butt operator?  That was my dad joke of the day.  Okay, but is another word for aunt, right?  I mean if you were placed in this sentence of your place, but with and it would still have the same meaning right?  cancel  There's pee and then there's Q.  So we have the message was sent from an unknown system so cute, right?  but so let's just call that and  it was not scan for viruses. So that's not pee.  I guess that's not on there is there.  alrighty  any questions about that?  Good question. Does it matter the order for and  yeah, so and it doesn't matter.  The and operator in the OR operator are what we call commutative so you can put them in either order.  Does it matter for any element?  What do you mean by Elementary?  Yeah, there's something called the conditional that it matters. Yeah, we haven't gotten to that yet, but for everything we've seen so far for the  Binary operators, they've all been commutative so far.  Now we're going to see that this conditional the order matters between just two variables. So yeah.  so in this case.  No.  None of them are right.  Right because she has a or instead of and and B has not Q instead of not pee.  Okay.  Well, speak of the devil will get to the conditional right now the conditional operator. So this is the if P then Q or P implies Q and A.  We all kind of have a sense of what this means right if  if I do p then Q happens if this is kind of like the the idea and in English, you could probably explain it to me, but I'm not so concerned about the English. I mean I am concerned about the English translation, but we want to define it.  Formally using a truth table.  so  Let's think about this this statement. Okay, I say if it is raining right now, then the ground is wet.  okay, so this is a compound proposition or it's a  Let's just call it a proposition because it has a truth value.  I ain't either true or false.  I'm done, asking you whether or not it's true or false in which case would you most confidently declare that I am wrong?  How would you disprove my my statement or how would you?  Communicate to me that that statement that proposition is false.  So, let's see here.  Okay, so we're saying be it is raining and the ground is not wet.  If that ever happens, you could call me a liar, right because I said if it's raining then the ground will be the ground will be wet.  But you're standing on her umbrella and the ground around you is still dry. So you say you were wrong.  Right. So this is kind of the the older if anything like this happens.  Then you're wrong. Okay, so that means that P is true and Q is false. I want this to be false.  So what about these these other statements a c and d?  These all represent the other rows in my truth table. Okay. So if I say it is raining and the ground is wet then it's consistent with what I said. So this should be true.  If it's not raining.  And the ground is wet.  It doesn't follow from what I said write my thing only my statement.  I realize on the on the assumption that it's raining. So if it's not raining, you can't say anything. It doesn't matter if the ground is wet or ground is dry. It doesn't affect my statement being true. Okay. So both of these cases you get a true here.  Hey, so does that we're going to define the implication and any kind of preconceived notion you had about it. Let's all try to relate it to this truth table.  3 questions  It's + 10 week on 2 second statement is false.  Yeah, that's kind of.  Because of the nature of the the sentence that I chose.  I'm sorry.  an exclusive or  right, it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't negated and I understand your your concern, but I guess another way to say it is that  if I knew that a a c and d  If I knew that these were always true.  And I also knew that this is always false.  Then I can stay this.  Right to be true.  Okay, let's move on. Okay. So this is the conditional this how we're going to define it.  Okay now.  This is such a special thing that you actually get.  Names for the p&q and this kind of answers somebody's question about this one not being commutative and so p and Plies Q is not the same as Q implies p and we'll get to that in a minute. But that just means that pee has its as the first thing has a name is called the hypothesis or the antecedent and Q also has a name is called the consequence conclusion consequent.  Okay question.  If you already know that you would still like you at all. What are you?  Yeah.  always  it's always going to be this table Yeah, that's what that's how we're going to Define it and then  Let's try to Besar meaning from the table.  and hopefully it'll coincide with the meeting that you have in your mind, but  you'll see it you'll see how it's used as we go along.  Fast and Furious movies  your statements wrong  knock training grounds rap 2003  Right, but if the first row and the last two rows are all true, and the middle row is false. Then I can say with confidence that P implies Q.  an argument account  you can only get a conclusion when you get for all four.  Play say it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  right because  I mean because of the truth table, but because of the the way you think about it is that the statement is still true whether or not the statement is still true if the hypothesis is false.  All right.  Okay. So let's look at a few different ways to change around the the conditional. Okay. What if we flip it Q implies p  Okay, this is called the converse and I want you guys to know these terms and what they mean. Okay, so the converse q and v p so that means that true implies true. That's true.  false implies true  Is that true or false?  true  true implies false. That's false.  And then falsifies Falls, that's so sorry. I didn't I said false, but I wrote True.  And that's true. Okay. So right from here you can see that.  The conditional and it's reverse. It's Converse are not the same. I think don't they're not logically equivalent.  This is a very common mistake that people make.  You know, if you have a cause-and-effect, then you assume that the the other way is is true. Right. So let's go to back to our example about it about the rain.  So I say if it's raining then the ground is wet, okay.  From that statement. It's not enough to conclude the opposite. It's not the same as saying if the ground is wet, then it must have rained that you might be in like a there might be some sprinklers around right?  or something else  so this is kind of the first example where the  operation is not commutative.  Okay, so contrapositive.  An inverse contrapositive not p and not Q implies not-p.  This it is. I'm just going to fill them in you guys can check my work if you like and not-p implies. Not Q. This is like this.  So this is the inverse and contrapositive.  Hey, what are you what do you notice about the contrapositive?  P implies Q is logically equivalent to not Q implies not-p.  This is a very powerful concept. This is going to be what we base. A lot of are proofs on actually is that is this logical equivalence?  Okay, so if you all believe me that the statement if it rained if it's raining then the ground is wet.  Then you have to also believe the contrapositive of that statement. What will be the contrapositive of that statement?  The ground is not wet then it is not raining.  Those are equivalent statements are logically equivalent.  All right.  so  the Congress and the inverse are also logically equivalent. We don't see the inverse so much but it comes about here and there the converse you see a lot because  it's sort of a natural question if I tell you that if it rains then the ground is wet. It's it's a natural question to ask. What if the ground is wet. Does that mean it rained went so if you're curious you might want to look into that. So if if that is the case then we get something else.  Something that's called a biconditional.  Okay. So a biconditional is something that where it's let's just Define it to be there by conditional. This is like the if and only if  okay.  and  one way to say it is that either p&q are both true or p and Q are both false.  in a way, it's kind of like saying he implies q and Q implies p  So which one of these compound propositions is logically equivalent to P. If and only if Q that's that's how I call this thing if and  only if but the actual character is called a biconditional.  All right good.  Okay, so I guess we're leaning towards none of the above. That's true.  Okay, you can write the truth table of each one of these out and you can see that is different from here.  Is it related in any way to any of these?  Is that right?  Because P exclusive or q that saying they have to be different right and then the biconditional says they have to be the same kind of like.  difference  Okay question.  What is D bats are exclusive or?  is there an exclusive and  I don't know.  I never heard of it.  Why is it not be?  Which one?  p and Q  so  let's draw another.  P and Q is true false false false.  Right so that it doesn't have the same truth values and that's how we're defining logical equivalence is by the truth value. So I have to be the same all the way down.  Okay.  So here's another thing to think about.  compound propositions A and B are logically equivalent if and only if a  Biconditional B is a tautology.  Why is that the case? Well, all that saying is that bought ology means that it's always true right and a if and only if B means that if a and b are both true, then you get true if a and b are both false and you also get true.  And so if and only if b equal is a tautology means that A and B will always share the same truth value no matter what.  Okay, good. So  Let's try to translate this sentence. And I know that there might be some words in there that we haven't really gone over how to directly translate them.  But take a look see if you can.  Figure it out.  It's the same p&q. But now the ascent now the sentence says the message is scanned for viruses whenever the message was sent from an unknown system.  Seems like what? That's what my computer should do.  right  Okay. Got some competing viewpoints. Can we have like a little discussion here, aren't you talk to your neighbor and see if you can convince them of what you put up there and maybe we'll see.  the heights of the graph change  Let me move this thing here.  Are you guys still see it?  Aragon  All right. Looks like the tables have turned.  Now everybody says none of the above.  What do you guys think it is?  Okay.  Any other comments?  You don't have any idea what her in the skin when it wasn't sent.  Would you say that?  Right and that's kind of like how we filled in those two rows with true when the hypothesis was false. So it was good to hear is to in this part is to try to figure out which one is the hypothesis. Which one is the  What was it called the consequent?  Okay. So in this case Q is the hypothesis, right?  Whenever the message was sent from an unknown system. So that's what we're supposing to be true. In order to make the claim that the message was scanned. So to make the claim the consequence is a will.  Guess we're sort of at a time here, but will look at different ways of saying P implies Q. Okay. So there's or cumin pipe P this kind of thing. So we'll use words like implies or if P then Q or we'll use the word whenever or when so all of these things.  I will describe p.m. Play Ice Cube. "
