Is this thing on?  testing testing testing  Let's begin.  A few announcements I guess is that you can look on the website for?  For office hours now, they should all be on there, you know, they might change here and there but hopefully that's kind of be that's going to be more or less how we're going to have the office hours. So  I forgot when I signed up for already, but it's up there.  Hope you guys have gotten started on the homework.  I hope everybody has gotten a clicker today.  If you don't have one today and you want to get credit for today's participation and come talk to me after class, okay, and we can talk about it and I'll also there is the discussion section tonight. So question.  Yes frequency is a b.  So, you know, of course the discussion section is is not mandatory, but maybe you should go to see you know, what you think about it and what we're going to do there. It's mainly going to be focusing on these like number representations the algorithm that we did in class on Friday Russian peasant multiplication this type of stuff. I think it'll be enjoyable in might help you with the concept. So I encourage you to go at least this first time and of course if you if you think that is helpful than keep on going there to help you guys, so  I'd say use all the resources that you can okay, so let's get started today. So today's lesson is mainly going to be about decimal binary a different number systems. We're going to learn how to convert between two number systems and talk about  certain algorithms that will do multiplication addition these types of things on different kinds of number systems. We all know how to do it on base 10, but how does that change when we going to a different base?  Okay, before we began I kind of wanted to get a sense of how you guys are.  Connecting because I do want you to have find some study groups, especially for the exams.  But also just to talk about different topics in class, of course for the homework. I only want you to work on your own study group, but I want you to find new people to talk to.  Cancel are we doing?  Mostly on that end. Okay. Hopefully that'll go up as  looks like people are meeting right now.  Now hopefully that will go up and you guys will get to know each other.  By way of office hours or just study groups and stuff like that.  All right good.  okay, so the  Let's just kind of summarize what we did on Friday, which was algorithms. Which out what I want you to get out of this is that it's a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing a confrontation or for solving a problem. And there's nothing in this definition. Remember that tells you that the algorithm is actually going to work right? We thought we talked about algorithm on Friday that didn't work. So the algorithm is just a set of instructions whether or not it works how efficient it is. All of that kind of is more we have to cut it down a little bit deeper into what's going on.  So the main topic of today is representation number representation. How do we represent numbers and we'll talk about how me and you do it how people did it in ancient times how different cultures do it? How computers do it? What is the purpose or what is the significance of all of these different things?  Okay. So basically we all know we all use a base 10 system even even writing this this number itself is in base 10, it's 10 in base 10 and what do you think of base 10? That's what most of you will think just right right off the bat, but just remember that this is just the markings on a page that represent that quantity running. So in mathematics we often like to think of 10 as the quantity not as the markings with the markings help us because they they let us do these different algorithms in order to subtract and add and all that kind of stuff.  And computer their space too, and we're going to talk about that in a minute.  So decimal and binary those are kind of the most.  Relevant basis to you as a computer scientist, right?  Majority of all the majority of the cultures in the world today use the base 10 the decimal system. That means that each digit in the number you can have an integer value ranging from 0 to 9 10 different values. Does anybody have any idea why 10 became of the number system that we use?  10 fingers probably that's what I was thinking too.  We all have 10 fingers. I don't know anybody seen The Simpsons.  They all have eight fingers so you would imagine that those creatures.  Would have a base 8 number system, right?  I don't know any other thoughts or  it's probably the ten fingers thing. So in a in a sense, it's kind of arbitrary, right I mean  I was like looking up this type of stuff to try to throw him some some fun facts and there's like this study that says that five fingers is like the most optim evolutionarily evolutionary biology number to have s fingers and they had this whole thing about it. It's kind of cool but also sort of arbitrary it's kind of like proving something after you know, it's true. You know, it's  I don't know. That's why I think but we're going to see you in a minute that not everybody thinks that way. Okay computer is generally use a base 2 binary system. This means that each bit is a number is a number is either 0 or 1/2 different values. Does anybody have any idea why that is the case?  But certainly you can build something that can store more than two.  Okay, so maybe you're yeah, maybe it's it's better to just store Tuukka storing 10 might make the components a little bit more complicated.  Okay, so it's sort of the same idea right? It's really easy to make a switch that goes on and off right you don't have to deal with anything else.  Where you can use unary?  Invicta watches 76140  Okay, we'll come back to that. We'll come back to that.  design an alarm system  Hollywood between the voltage in u.s. Have two voltages and simplify your design.  Okay, we'll get back to that too. I think that is part of the reason that makes it.  So attractive to use for computers is because you can you don't have it. If you only have a range it's really easy to tell between those two, right?  Sonos  give me a say the voltage thing.  If you can't look like a basement or other Vision or one and they're doing quantum.  Right, so that kind of gives you sort of like a ranger or something. Yeah, the Cube It's kind of  China beyond the scope of this class but something fun to think about  Yeah.  So what about just kind of propositional logic, right? That's kind of like we're going to talk about that as like the next thing.  Logical fire to binary system has more than two options then.  Logic, right there there certainly are logical structures that have more than more than two. But to at least for us is like a lot easier to handle. I think I think that's part of the reason that we use binary. I'm going to we're going to talk a little bit more about it.  That will sort of answer all those questions and and take them all into consideration, but it's really nice. That is binary because now we can use true-false and logical things in order to study them because humans have been studying that type of logic for centuries. So it's a natural way to go into their Okay, so  Has anybody heard of the ox app men people of New Guinea?  So there's the island and there they live in that in this region this mountainous region here.  they have a base 27 number system Renee, so  Like you know how we said. Oh, it's the number 10 because we have 10 fingers. Will they said oh, it's the number 27 cuz there's 27.  points on your body that you count  I'm just I just want to share this with you because it's it's like it's not a  it's kind of an arbitrary thing that we chose 10 these guys chose 27. And of course this picture has the numbers in in decimal number representation. I don't know how they draw their numbers or if they even had that kind of thing.  So have some notes here about it.  Yeah, so one is just the word for thumb.  And 6 is the word for wrist 12 is the word for ear and 16 is the word for ear on the other side.  And 27 is the word for Pinky on the other side. So they have all that kind of stuff.  Okay. So here's another example the Maya have this language our number system called sold soul. And it's a base 20 number system. Some people think that it's 20 because of wise anybody think I have an idea.  Fingers and toes that's what they say. We actually know a lot about the way they they write the numbers and you can you can you can look at this light a little bit later and try to try to absorb it but essentially you have zero it's like this seashell, right and then one through four is a sequence of dots and then that turns into a Aline and then you start riding the dots again and you get to line what you get up to three lines or four dots you you have a  A two-tiered number, right? So 20 is 120 and 0 other things analog of the base 10 number system. We we go from one digit until we get the 10 and when we get to 10 we get two digits, so  It's kind of cool because it's sort of a mix between base 5 and base 29th. Can you can kind of see how it revolutionizes and then which is cool as they have this like fancy poetic way of writing numbers by these faces. So I don't know if you can see the numbers but instead of writing 13 as this thing you can write it as of this face.  But you write that and that's 13.  was that  yeah, it seems like a lot of work, but you know, it's  I don't know if you wanted to write it nicely and and be an empress like the king or something and write it like that.  so  there's another there's another reason that they think that they use a base 20 system. And this has to do with the calendar. So one of their calendars there their religious calendar is it is a mix between base 20 and base 13 and is like these the historians like to think about him as like rotating gears.  and  the 20 that they believe comes from this snake this tropical rattlesnake that lives in the area that they worship and it's because it grows new fangs every 20 days so they can have that as one of their numbers and that my kind of reinforced why they use the fingers and toes. I don't know and then 13 the snake has these these squares on its scales where each side is a length 13 Pandora or is 13 scales long. So they use that and then 20 * 13 is 260 and that's like very close to the 29 solar Cycles, which is also sort of close to the length of a human pregnancy. So all these kind of things going to work together. Anyhow,  In out these guys might say oh, why'd you pick 12:10 fingers? It's obviously better to use the number of days when a snake grows new fangs. So again like it. It's just an arbitrary thing. So here I put a bunch of other bases that maybe you can you can look at at some point.  The main ones of course are base 2 and base 10. That's what we talked about already.  and  Base for 8 and 16 these These are what we as humans use to compact binary and we're going to talk about that a little bit later to but they're they're nice to use for that. So this one is kind of interesting. There's ternary.  So some early computers used a ternary number system.  We're not going to go into the actual math, but it turns out that ternary is more economical to use then binary and the Russians in the fifties and in the sixties, they had a coronary computers and those computers were using less energy to do the same kind of calculations. It's kind of interesting. My question is why do we switch to Binary? I think it's cuz it's it's easier for us to understand the true and false nature instead of like this true false and maybe but there's some science fiction writers and computer scientist that believe that in the future will go back to ternary because when you know, we have to do more and more and more calculations. It'll use less power less resources to actually do it.  if you're interested in why I just found it on the Wikipedia page, so  It turns out that the most economical bass ever is e u know that number the calculus number.  but it's really hard to use a irrational base SO3 is the is the closest number to e so, that's why it's the  any questions  Okay, so let's talk about bases and algorithms. So we tried to do this 147 x 17 in class, right?  And we did the Russian peasant peasant mathematics multiplication. What you're going to see is like it didn't really.  Depend on the base 10 right? It was just kind of like this weird algorithm. But the way that you learned it in school. It is very necessary that its base 10 so you can line up the tens and line up the ones and all that kind of stuff.  Okay, so that's how we write it out.  now  I have a clicker question for you.  You can write it out as as this way. So if N is a positive integer, and we express its usual decimal expansion is a sons of multiples of powers of 10, then which one of these things is true the exponents and powers of ten in the some are all positive. There is a largest exponent in the sum and the coefficient of each power of 10 is a non-negative integer less than 10.  What do you guys think?  Okay. Well, I'm happy to say that you are all right.  There's no wrong. Answer up here is there.  Okay, so these are the types of kind of building blocks. I want you to think about when you when you're building a number in any base. So this 10 of course is not the only base and it's  it's just the base that we like to use Okay, so  if we talk about powers of be so now I'm looking at a arbitrary base B and  Just so that we don't have to deal with unary.  We're going to have the bass be an integer greater than one. Okay. So do you have that there is a unique choice.  Of these three things. So K. This is the non-negative integer. This is like this is also called the number of digits. Okay. So for each number, there is unique number of digits. It needs in order to be represented in that bass be  Okay, you have those a 0 a 1/2 a k - 1 these are the coefficients of the expansion. These are just the digits right? Because remember when we split up that 142 you were just kind of expanding it.  Okay, and we have that a k - 1 is non-zero. That just means that there is a highest rank the heroes of highest value if you Trail off with zeros.  To the left of the number. It doesn't change the number right? So we just kind of start there.  Getting in this is how you write the number now. Another thing I want you to get out of this slide is this word here unique there is only one way to do it and that's kind of the strength of using this at to represent numbers and you go back into the history. This is not how everybody used to do it right if you think about the Roman numerals,  They didn't do it this way. They have their own system. And if you ever tried to do any arithmetic with Roman numerals, you'll see that it's kind of a mess. But if you do it this way everything lines up and you can carry the one and carry the things in it it it really makes for a nice arithmetic algorithms.  Okay, so when we write about the expansions when we expand a number in any base other than 10, usually we just put some parentheses around it and put the the base in the corner and that way we can all kind of agree on which base were using.  Okay, so  Yeah, that's just that I was doing exercise 17.  write this  and bases  2  3  4  let's skip to 8  and let's go to 16.  Think about how to do it.  If you're if you're kind of stuck then let me know but also know that we're going to go through a step-by-step algorithm to do this. So I just kind of want you to exercise. How would you go about writing it in these bases?  Oh wait, let's not do 16 yet. Sorry.  You really tell you about that when you let's just do these things.  Beast Boy  Does anybody have the two one yet?  1000  okay, so I'm not going to ask you how you got it yet because you probably you met you may have your own method of getting it and we're going to go through an algorithm to do it and it might be the same thing. But all I want to do is check. Let's check to see if it's right. Okay. So what does 100001 mean it means? Well, you're you're right. Most one is 1 * 2 to the 0.  and the next one is 0 * 2 to the 1 + 0 * 2 squared + 0 * 2 cubed + 0 * 1  1 * 2 to the 4 so basically is just 16 + 1 which is 17.  Okay. How about for 3?  I was try somebody else here.  1 to 2  so this will be 2 * 320 + 2 * 3 to the 1 + 1 * 3 squared.  So that's 9 plus.  6 + 2  17  Okay good.  Next one is 101.  And how about for the eighth one?  11  211  21  okay, you guys can check these other ones as an exercise.  Are there any other questions about this?  Okay, so all these ones all these bases that we just used our all bases that are less than 10, right? And so there are enough digits in our alphabet or whatever. How do you call our  Number is the Arabic numeral system digits in there that we can just reuse those for these ones. Right? So when we have bases that are greater than 10 then we need to introduce new symbols to represent numbers that are 10 or greater. Okay. So for hexadecimal in particular, this is base 16  when to introduce six new basis because it's six more than 10. Okay. So of course is 0 through 9, these are  We're just going to recycle these because we're all really so familiar with them that we can just reuse them. So then that in the next six characters, they really could be anything you want. But computer scientists mathematicians. We've all agreed that we would just use the first six capital letters of the alphabet has the value  Of 10, so just a means pain, right and B is 11 C is 12 vs. 13 He is 14 1/2 is 50. Okay, what's 16?  1 0  kind of let's put a little  make something to that way. Okay any questions about that? This is just what we're going to use.  All right.  Okay. So for example, what could this number which base system? Could it be in and maybe another question to think about is which one could it not being?  and so I think most of you guys grass for the  the concept pretty well more than one of the above which ones  BC and eat right before Beach is a b c and d and e  Oh, man.  But not a right because a you you're only allowed to use 0 and 1.  Okay.  Oh.  Let's actually do this as an exercise. What is this number in base 8?  So it's going to be 1 * 8.  cubed, right + 4 * 8 squared + 0 * 8 + 1 in base 10  Well, it's 1 * 10 cubed + 4 * 10 squared + 0 * 10 + 1. I know this one because it's just one four zero one.  It's not a big deal. They're so now 16 lb 1 * 16 squared cubed + 4 * 16 squared + 0 * 16 + if I give you a number and a certain base, it's pretty easy to figure out. What is that numbers value? And really what I'm asking for you to do is convert it into base 10 because once we get into base 10, we kind of have more of a number sense or what how big that number is in the end. So and so on beso these are the three numbers that we got and it makes sense that the base 8 number is is less than the base 10 number is less than 16 number just by the nature of how these numbers are built.  Okay.  Let's do an arithmetic example  I'm going to add 1314 + 2652 but both of these are going to be in base 8.  and the number that I want I want it also to be in base 8  Okay, so take a minute. See how it works. Try this one out and we'll kind of finish it off together in a second.  All right.  If I plug this into my calculator what's going to happen?  1314 plus 2652 I got 3966. Is that the right answer?  No.  Let's figure it out one very easy clue about that answer is what there's a 9 in it. You can't have a 9 in this number. So, how do we figure it out? So where we going to do? 4 + 2 is 6.1 + 5 is 6  3 + 6 is 9  the how I do it.  You could carry it, right? So 8 is now like our new 10, right? So 9 is 1 more than 8 so I have a one here and I have to carry the other one.  And then one plus two plus two is four 4166.  Base 8 now so does that mean that that's the that's the base 8 representation of 3966.  I have nothing to do with it, right. It's  just get the figure out which number system you're in and make sure that everything is there. Okay. So are there any questions about this?  Okay, so as an exercise.  I want you to verify.  with base 10 numbers  Okay, so do that at at home?  questions  Okay good. So let's talk about an algorithm a step-by-step way to build up these things to to convert from one base to another. Okay constructing a base B expansion.  so the input is going to be a number n  and a base B. Now. How is that number and going to be given to you?  Kind of depends right? It's it's basically just how how you defined the algorithm but let's say it's a base 10 number we don't care about its representation with care about its size. Its actual quantity. Like how big is that number? So if you give it to me in 10 or in binary or in hexadecimal anything like that, we want this album to be able to work for all of those things because what I want to do is basically take that quantity that idea and turn it into this base B number.  Okay, so the output is going to be okay. Just remember what cave is is the number of digits?  and then we're going to need the coefficients and  I guess we don't actually need pay as an output. But because the number of coefficients you have will be.  WK of them, but it's nice to kind of think about how many digits are going to be there.  And we can kind of put it into the algorithm.  Okay, so here's the first question.  how do  you  find  k  given an empty  how do you know how many digits there will be?  Okay has to do with log base B of an but imagine that you just kind of wanted to do it without like a calculator.  figure out the largest  value-based be that fits into n without going over.  I like giving change like the chain joggers in a textbook like you a straight.  Okay, good. It's kind of like a greedy thing. Right and if it's actually finding the log base B of that number, but basically what you want to do is fine some K such that b to the K - 1 is less than 10 is less than b to the k.  I guess there should be less than or equal to so there's really only one that can do that and so fine that K and the way to do it, I mean you could go for the logarithm or you could just keep on trying right you keep on going and getting higher and higher.  Okay.  So once I find that k  I'm going to need to figure out how many of those be to the K - ones fit will fit inside an or are less than an okay, and that's going to be my first coefficient example, so you see what I mean, but  Essentially this part and finding that first coefficient is really all the algorithm because the next step you do is you subtract that number from the original and you do it again. You just keep on going. It's kind of like a like a loop like a for Loop.  okay, so you find K and you work down to find K - 1 K - 2 and so on Okay, so  This is exactly what we were talking about. What's the smallest power of bee that is bigger than n and that's how we're going to find K.  So you find K by Computing successive powers of be until you find the smallest K that this thing is true.  and we can kind of think about this as a  a code. Oh, we already did this one, huh?  Didn't we?  I forget about this then.  We already did it. Look at this.  Okay, so initialize the value remaining has it just started at the the current value.  For each value from I from K - 1 down to zero set AI to be the largest number in between 0 and B- one for which AI time is b e to the I is less than or equal to be.  So this AI is the digit, right? That's why I'm I'm only  I'm only allowing the numbers to go in between 0 and B -1.  Okay. So once I get that digit, I subtract it from the value and updating me and then you just keep on going over and over again.  Okay, how does this algorithm sound? Is it definite which means as it is an unambiguous what you do each step given any input of the correct form?  Yeah, right.  Is it finite will it terminate?  It will write it will terminate because this would be the value is decreasing every time that's not enough to show that it terminates. But that's a start. You also have to say. Well it's decreasing by integer amount every time an integer amount greater than zero every time and in these kind of things. Those are those will help you get down to that at the algorithm. Is it correct? It's kind of a deeper question it is it happens to be correct, but I haven't done anything to do to convince you of it. So it kind of is something that maybe you can think about why is this, correct?  Okay, so for bass to representations.  If I had a integer n and this is base 2 representation then what is 4 * n?  You could.  You do what?  And then what do you do with those places?  You got zero Zone.  So you're saying that this should just be  AK -1 down to a1000  Questions or comments about that?  3 * 100 in base 10. Yeah, exactly.  Communicating the multiplier is not like a power of the base then. I mean you can't do anything nice.  Okay, so let's look at this question here.  if an is equal to this number and and is divisible by 4 when exactly when what needs to be the necessary and sufficient conditions in order to  Be sure that the number is divisible by 4.  I guess we just have a few more minutes left. Alright, let's see here.  paracon all across the board here  Yeah.  It's actually not up there. None of the above.  Does anybody know what the condition is?  A180 must both be zero sum.  a tricky thing A1 is 0 +  a 0 is 0  that's the necessary and sufficient conditions. What are the conditions for a number to be divisible by a hundred because 4 in binary is just a hundred.  Okay, so  I guess we have a few more slides to start off the day on Wednesday with but that's okay.  There's some practice of this stuff on the homework. So get started on that and you can  good night DIA.  Yeah.  Sure, if you like.  There's no other.  UC San Diego podcast. EDU "
