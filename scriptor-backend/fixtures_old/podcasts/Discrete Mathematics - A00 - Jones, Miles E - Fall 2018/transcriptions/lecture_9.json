  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Okay. Good morning, everyone.  Thank you. Alright, let's get started.  so  Let's talk about what we're going to do today is basically more proofs. We really want you to have a good idea of how to do a proof. Of course. Once you find a problem in front of you.  Being able to figure out what proof strategy you need to do that comes with a lot of practice and maybe it's something sometimes there's useful tricks that we can we can look into or clues that we can get from the problem. But mainly just have to kind of do these more and more so we're going to do a few examples and class. Give me some examples on homework. Okay. So one thing I want to remind you or at least clue you in on is that in the homework there is something somewhere in the homework. We say something like  Erath medical symbols or something like that?  and what we mean by that are  plus multiply divide and  subtract  Use only plus multiply divide and subtract that you guys are going to do. Okay, so get into groups and I want you to write out this proof not you guys can just get started if you like. If you were having trouble of where to begin then raise your hand and I'll help you with with the starting statement. Okay, ready go.  I'm sorry.  Sure, but you might want to use something a different definition in order to help you get to the conclusion.  Thank you for the flights for today or not.  Try to refresh.  Okay, I will see if I can figure that out.  It seems like the slides haven't been posted yet. So let me just post them real fast, but keep on working on this.  Okay.  Change my flight.  All right, so they're on there now or just wait a few minutes. Maybe it might take a minute to upload.  All right.  How is the proof going good bad?  weird  you feel like you're writing too much.  well  You can say all integers I guess or you can restrict it down to just even integers right? We're only really talking about the even ones are the only ones that are useful right you can even say all real numbers right for all real numbers and if and is even if it's restricted to just that domain then  then we show that this is from  Okay, good. I let some maybe try to finish this off together. That is even then so is N squared. So what's going to be my first line of the proof?  Okay, so assume.  That n is even and you'll see this same sentence over and over again for starting these kind of implication proofs soon. And is even or let N be even or something like that.  Okay. So now with this direct proof we want to kind of Step by Step get down to the conclusion and I heard somebody ask can we use the definition of mod 2 for the definition of even and I like that question because it it kind of allows me to elaborate on.  When you're doing a proof.  You might have two different ways to go right or more than one way to go like as a logical step and understanding which way to go. It's not necessarily obvious when you starting the proof so you might have to go down One Direction and find that you don't really get somewhere and maybe go down a different one. I think you can do it with Mod. You just have to know a lot more about modular arithmetic. So we're just going to do it with the other definition of even which means okay so soon the end is even that means there exists some  Integer, so let's call it there exist.  Let's call it a  I'll just write it out actually.  there exists  an integer is a  such that.  and is equal to 2 a  Oh, I was going to do this as a quicker question.  Okay, let's just do it anyway bigger question time.  cricket  Okay, let's see. So.  Okay. So if you're saying any more than one of the above then which ones are they?  C and  T & B  yeah, so Dave is like the it's it's you do a / 2 but you you leave off the remainder, right? So a div 2 is always going to be an integer by the definition of the  Are the definition of dip actually when we wrote a / 2 is an integer?  Then that would be fine to write.  So good.  2 / integers A&B with a nonzero there exists a b such that b is equal to a c this means that a divides b or B is an integer multiple of a so you are going to see these kinds of kinds of things, Okay, and this is sort of how we Define it.  Okay, so let's go to the next slide here.  So this is the this is the definition we're going to use an integer a is even if there is some integer be such that a is equal to 2 B. Let's kind of flip it around an integer is odd if that statement is not true. So integers will always either be even or odd.  Text to integer is odd. If it's not even it's because integers have this parody right there either even or odd.  Or equivalently you could write an odd integer is it is integer such that there is some integer be such that a is equal to 2 b + 1.  Instead it might be helpful to think about the form of the number as either to be or to be plus one depending on if it's even or odd.  All right. So let's finish this one off.  assume  and is even okay good then there exists.  a integer p  Such that.  And is equal to be okay. Now, what should I do next?  Okay, good. Now we should do like some actual arithmetic here and we're trying to get to something about N squared. So let's Square both sides.  M squared is equal to 2 b.  squared  Okay, let's just rearranged.  And squared is equal to 2 * 2 b squared.  Right now I have that N squared is in the form of an even number.  Right there is because to be squared is an integer.  Since to be squared is an integer.  And squared is even and I can conclude that because of the previous slide with this definition.  Okay.  Okay, did anybody have another different proof?  How do we prove that to be squared is an integer? Okay, that's good. That's very good. So we haven't we haven't done that here. Right? And this is a good thing to think about when you're doing these types of problems to be squared. We're claiming that it's an integer because of previous knowledge that. I I hope that you guys have about integers and that maybe that you learned in grade school is that if you multiply two integers together, the result is an integer, right? Okay, so that's good. I'm glad that you brought that up.  So if X and Y are integers.  XY is an integer  Okay, cuz this is enough to prove that to be square to the integer because be as an integer and 2 as an integer. So 2 * B * B is an integer to  that's good.  How do we do?  What you need to know that we would for sure need to prove by interview. Ask question exam.  I also very good question at how what level of detail do you have to go into and it's it's really hard for me to really put something on there something like this. You guys can just say it's an integer and we can all be agreement on how agreement on this closure property of integers.  If you're unsure then then ask I'd say but generally kind of like arithmetic grade school type properties. We're going to assume to be true right also, you know.  A x b is the same thing as B * a those kind of things were just going to kind of phone assume that everybody agrees that they're true.  I hope that helps a little.  Any other questions?  Okay. So again along that same line, how do we know that squaring both sides was going to also equate the balance the equation, right? So simple kind of algebraic operations will just be assumed to be true also.  What if I did this what if I said and is equal to 2 B, right? That's what we started with and instead of squaring both sides.  I multiply both sides by a n.  Then what would I get?  M squared is equal to 2 * BN.  I think this is kind of another way to to do it. And so there might be two different kind of solution paths.  and then you can say since  the N is an integer.  250 + sqrt is even then so is N squared and where we're going to use the definition of odd to be that there exists an integer such that and is equal to  That integer x 2 + 1. Let me write it out a is odd means.  there exists  integer  B such that  Hey if you could succeed B plus one.  Okay, who started off with assume and is odd?  I wrote suppose.  They going to make a difference.  You see all this medicine.  Who had this is their second line?  Looking good. You guys are on the right track kind of?  Okay. Next thing I'm going to do is so let's just finish this out together. So let's Square both sides, right?  N squared is equal to 2 b + 1 squared right? And what's 2 V + 1 squared?  4 B squared + 4 b + 1 okay. So what I want to put it into the form  Into this form here, right? So what we can do is factor out a 2 out of each one of those Forest.  We can get that and squared is equal to 2 times something in here.  which is 2 b squared + 2b + 1  and so  Just like what we said before to be squared + 2B is an integer, right? Because we're just doing arithmetic operations on integers. We won't talk about divide here, right? Because that's that won't keep an integer by multiplying and adding queso since  2 b squared + 2B is an integer.  N squared is odd. Okay any questions about that?  What is the FCC?  Such that.  question  if you factor out for be if you factor out for beet and it's not in the correct form, right? I mean it will still be right and like you could still conclude that it's odd because write 4 as a multiple of 2 and all that stuff, but we really want to be like transparent in what we're trying to show. So if I factor out the two then this is exactly the form I want and then I can just one step later conclude.  He basically stopped at the gym right after if there isn't very relieved because basically basically you're saying I had to where they go to people's Mortuary and to dry them lying to me.  Okay, so that's based on that other theorem, right?  Yeah, I would say you have to prove that if the product of two numbers two odd numbers is odd in the proof is going to look very similar to this right now. So that's something that I would say. Let's not assume.  Hey, maybe later on in the class. We can start assuming it for this I'd say let's just do it this way.  Okay, so we've done to implications, right and is even implies and squared is even and is Autumn Place in squared is on what about the Converses if N squared is even then n is even  Okay, before you guys start writing the proof, is there a tricky way that we can do this?  Okay, are we allowed to prove to use prove that we've already prove theorems that we already proved in order to prove this? Yes.  Okay, so  this statement right? So this statement is and squared is even  implies and is even  what is the contrapositive of this statement?  And is not even let's just call not even odd night and is odd.  implies  and squared is  we're talking about an is an integer, right?  We just get this we get this for free by using the contrapositive.  Alright, so similarly for this one write the contrapositive here is and is even implies and squared is either going to put on the other one. Which I've already proven. And so this proof comes for free. Okay, you could prove it directly, but you're going to find that it's a little bit more tricky because you kind of have to if you if you suppose that and squared is odd, then N squared is equal to sum to be plus one, but it's kind of hard to to extract out the factors right without without really knowing what be is queso will see that contrapositive is a good proof technique sometimes to be able to  Okay, let's move on to our next proof of the lecture which is going to be to prove this statement.  For all integers K greater than 1/2 the K - 1 is not a perfect square.  his kind of  This is what people think mathematicians do all day, but really?  It's more like what we're doing today in the class. You kind of go through your options. And you say okay. Well that didn't work. So let me try something different and so on.  Okay, try to find patterns. You know, that's why practicing math is is good because you find patterns and then you can keep on doing them.  Okay, so let's talk about perfect squares.  An integer is a perfect square. If and only if there is some integer be a is a perfect square is equal to be square, which of the following is not a perfect square.  I really hope you guys get this one.  So let's talk about each one a zero.  Is there an integer such that is there an integer be such that b squared is equal to 0?  Yes 0 write 0 is equal to 0 square. Okay. Is there an integer be such that b squared is equal to 1?  Is there an integer be such that b squared is equal to 2?  Are you sure?  We'll talk about \u221a 2 later. But yet so too is does not have it. Okay, and then for 4  4 is equal to 2 square.  naked  All right.  So if we were to do a direct proof, what would we want to assume for this statement? We say for integer K greater than 1/2 the K - 1 is not a perfect square.  Okay. K is greater than one that's what we want to assume assume K is an integer greater than 1 like a bee an integer.  Assume K is greater than one now.  I'm not actually going to do a direct proof for this but I want a kind of have us all do a thought experiment on what a direct proof would look like. Okay, you assume K is some integer greater than one, right?  Then you build this number to the K - 1.  And you have to say something about it that it's not a perfect square that's kind of hard to do because it's kind of like a negation of a like a well-known fact. It's it's it's easy to describe something that is a perfect square. It's kind of harder to describe something that's not a perfect square cuz you have to go through every single integer and show that that integer squared is not equal to this thing. Okay. So this this type of thing happens a lot when you're trying to prove certain statements and so this is a nice time when you want to kind of whip it around and do the contrapositive.  So what would a proof by contrapositive look like?  So what will we assume in a proof by contrapositive?  Okay, good. Let's see here.  Okay, so actually the answer is D and it's because contrapositive remember you negate each side and flip it around. So the contrapositive now it will be for integers k  if 2K - 1 is a perfect square. So it's the negation of the conclusion.  Then K is less than or equal to one.  Okay.  Now this looks a little bit more manageable to do a direct proof. Why is that is because you're going to start with the structure. You're going to start with 2 K - 1 being a perfect square and with that structure, you know how to kind of break it up. You say well, we'll go through how to do it.  Okay, so  proof by contrapositive like a be an integer assume 2K - 1 is a perfect square. So one thing we should note here is that K has to be non-negative.  Because to to a negative integer power is a fraction. So we don't want any fraction fractional Parts in there. Cuz first of all KS got to be greater than or equal to 0  Okay, so  what can we conclude from this?  There is some integer C.  Such that.  2K - 1 is equal to c squared.  I want to show that K is less than or equal to one.  Okay, so  Using the using the above sentence. We just want to show that K is equal to 0 or k is equal to 1.  Let's go on solo by definition of perfect squares. There is some see such that we have this statement. So either K is 0 or 2 K - 1 is a positive integer cuz if K is 0 then you have 1-1 you get zero.  So kind of like and we're going to talk about this proof by cases in a bit, but this is kind of like a proof by cases in the in the sense that I'm going to show you that is true for zero and then I will show you for all the rest of the numbers.  Okay, so  If K is strictly greater than zero then is this integer even or odd?  all right, because any  positive integer exponent of 2 is going to be even so that -1 is going to be hot.  Okay, so  that's what we want to show or that's what we're going to use.  Okay, so let's do that.  Let K be greater than zero. We've already done the zero case. We showed that it's fine. So let's just focus on this case.  then  2 to the K - 1 this is odd, right and one way you can say it's odd is because we all know kind of the nature of oddness is either even number plus one or an even number minus one that kind of doesn't matter which way you go. But let's let's keep ourselves linked to the actual definition of oddness that we had. This is going to seem a little silly.  This is equal to 2 + 2 - 2.  -1  and then let's combine.  The plus two in the minus one to get a plus one. And then the two to the K - 2 and we get something that looks like this.  2 to the K - 2 + 1  And we can actually factor out a two we get two times two to the K - 1 + 1. Okay. So now we've actually put it into the form of Oceanside. This should be  Can I ask Lexie put it into the form of a?  odd number  Okay. So this whole time we are also assuming that this is equal to some square is equal to some c squared equals c squared. Okay. So that means c squared is odd number. What is that mean about sea?  It's also odd. We we prove that earlier today.  So c squared is odd that makes see odd taste. Let's just do kind of like a little aside here.  And say there.  is an integer be  such that.  C is equal to 2 B plus one, right?  Thanks. Hope we established that now we can write c squared.  c squared is equal to 4 B squared + 40 + 1  so let some let's kind of sort of start over now. What do I have I have that two k - 1 is equal to c squared and that's going to give me that 2K.  is equal to 4 B squared + 4 b + 1  use a different color now.  -1  let's let's do some algebra now and  if you're kind of like will wear it, where in the world is he going with this just stick with me? And and if you're like well, how would I ever  Peanut produce this on my own, you know just be patient and you know, you'll learn as you do this these examples case. I'm going to add one to both sides and I get to to the K is equal to 4 B squared + 4 b + 2  And then I'm going to divide Everybody by 2.  this side / 2  and the side / 2  Okay. What am I left with is two to the K - 1 is equal to  2 b squared + 2b + 1  Now what I have here is I have something that says 2 to the K - 1 is odd.  Let's bring this up here. Sorry. I'm all over the place, but  I only have so much room on the slide or two to the k.  -1 is equal to 2 times B squared plus b plus one. So to the K - 1 is equal to 2 times the integer plus one. So that means to the K - 1  Okay.  For what number K. Can I plug in to make to the K - 1 hot?  what write 1 - 1 is 0 to the 0 is 1  so  If k equals 1 then 2 to the 1 - 1 is 0 * 8 is 2 to the 0.  Which is one good.  if K is greater than 1  then two to the K - 1 is equal to 2 * 2 to the K - 2 even number bad.  This shows me that this part.  Can't work. It can't work that K is greater than 1 and that's exactly what I wanted to show. I wanted to show that it only works when K is less than or equal to one and I've shown that it works for zero and I shown that it works for what?  any questions  cuz when you factor out a to write then you you decrease the exponent.  This is a direct proof of the contrapositive. So we call it like a proof by contrapositive Shannon because the original statement we had to turn it around.  Okay, so we so 40. We did it here.  If K is zero.  Then you have to to the 0-1 which is 0 and that's already a square. So that's fine. And then for negative numbers, we said K must be non-negative or else it's not even integer anymore. So I'm not claiming that it works for every number less than or equal to 1 I'm just saying that if it's a perfect square, then it's got to be less than or equal to 1 can't be greater than 1 is another way to say it.  Microsoft question  dysport  Okay, so the client like whatever I got to this is the important thing to.  To note is this thing here?  This is what I got from the original statement cuz I said I first said  I first said that to to the K - 1 is a perfect square. Okay, let's start from that and then we logically deduced this highlighted part.  But this pie light apart is only true when K is equal to 1.  Because when K is equal to one you have two to the zero and two to the zero is one and one is odd.  Cuz it's two times to the K - 2 + 2 * an integer is even.  and that contradicts  it being hot.  Are we doing okay?  Okay, let's move on to another proof technique.  Okay. So if I say that N squared + 1 is less than or equal to 2 to the end when N is a positive integer with n in between 1 and 4. This is actually true.  So this is kind of a special case. This is something called proof by exhaustion, but it's also kind of like proof by cases and it comes from the fact that the domain that I'm working with is a finite domain and on top of that it's small right there's only four elements. So it wouldn't really take much effort for me to actually just write down all of the cases and that would be sufficient to prove it.  Here's the proof.  Case one assuming is one.  Then 1 squared + 1 is equal to 2 and 2 to the 1 is equal to 2. So their the sides are equal so you can kind of see how this goes. This is a valid way of proving it, but it only works in very specific special cases.  All right.  So this is exhausted. Let's look at an actual proof by cases.  Canton we might not have time to finish it. But at least we can start it.  So this is saying for every integer and N squared is greater than or equal to n you guys believe that  what do you kind of thinking?  Yeah, hopefully some of your kind of thinking well, okay, how does it work for negative numbers? And how does it work for positive numbers? Right. So those are two cases actually and so if we can we can show that it's true for both of those cases. Then we can show that is true for all integers. Okay, so it's going to be case one.  is supposed  and is negative.  And then case 2 will be supposed.  And is positive.  Should I skip a case?  Okay, we're didn't do you want to just do that on its own?  What do case 3?  suppose  and is zero then 0 squared is equal to 0 done. Okay, good get that one out of the way.  All right, let's do the negative one together suppose and is negative.  then  N squared is positive, right?  and  And is negative.  right there for  and is less than 0 is less than 10 squared. So and is less than 10 squared good done. That was pretty easy to write and and of course like you said before I'm kind of like piggybacking on Elementary arithmetic and definitions and stuff like that. But this is a sufficient amount of proof. So I'll have you guys do case 2 as an exercise.  Okay, just have a few more minutes left. I think I can maybe start on this one and then you can and then you guys are free to go.  OK every collection of six people  includes a group of three  Who all know one another or a group of three where nobody knows anybody?  That sounds surprising.  Okay the idea here.  Is to focus on one person either that person knows at least three of the other people or he only knows at most two of the others. So maybe I'll give you a I'll leave this for you guys to think about and we can we can start on that on Friday.  Can you re sandiego.edu? "
