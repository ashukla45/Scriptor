  "Full Transcript": "listening to a podcast  Okay. Good morning.  Thank you all for coming today.  sup  I guess I don't I didn't put in a today's gold. But let's just talk about today's goes for a sec before we get started. So.  What I'm going to attempt to do today is first bring you through a little bit more practice with this uncountable set idea.  And they diagnose ation proof and why it works and why it works sometimes and where does it not work in those kind of things to give you more of a sense of that and then we're going to introduce some some more Concepts that are very relatable to computer science and they're going to be we're going to prove some things about them using induction. So we'll be more induction practice to okay. So let's get started with what we ended with last time the set of irrational numbers. Is it countable or is it not countable?  Let's kind of think about what we know so far. What do we know? We know that the real numbers are countable or uncountable.  Okay, real numbers is uncountable.  What about the rational numbers?  It's comfortable remember the zig zag?  What is countable?  Hey there. Anyway that we can use these two facts to prove that the irrational numbers are uncountable.  rational number rational number  Okay good. So we're going to  let's like let  I don't know. I  Be the set.  irrational numbers  then we're going to use the fact that our is equal to I Union Q Frank.  Any real number is either a rash either rational or irrational? So Union those two sets together and you get the set of all the realest. Okay. So now how do we  Leverage that it's kind of like what you said. Let's do it in like a little bit more of a formal way. Okay, so let's do a proof by contradiction.  Assumed what?  assume  the set of all irrational numbers is countable.  Okay, then what?  then the real numbers is equal to  They're Union. We prove this right we prove that the union of two countable sets is countable.  Right there for our is countable.  contradiction  got questions about that.  Oh, that's the set of all irrational numbers.  I don't know if that's really good notation, but  That's what I named it. That's not standard notation for irrational numbers. Usually you write a rational numbers. Usually the notation is r- q  I think it's just all the real numbers minus although  Brittany other questions  Okay, let's move into more more sets and more cardinalities. Okay?  So let's go back. Remember the set 0 1 * right?  We're just recalled at this is the set of all finite bit strings. We talked about how this set is countable. I want you to prove it. Okay, ready go.  Hey talk with your neighbors come up with a justification of why this set is countable.  Let me know if you have any questions where to begin. If you need some hints, what are the types of methods we've used to show something is countable.  Morning.  Yeah, I remember that. If a set is countable, then you can list all of its elements out in a certain order.  I think that might be helpful.  right cuz you can kind of put a ordering on how you  Bill Nunn  Okay, so I think the most straightforward proof is to show me.  that  you are able to list.  them all  prank  If you can list them all since countable. Is anybody have a list they want to propose.  Okay, so the way that you count in binary so half of one would be one.  Half of 2 would be what one zero.  Half of 3 would be one one.  Half of 4 would be 100 and so on cuz this is this does this map to every single finite bit string?  Yeah, you're missing the empty string you're missing like any something like this or anything with leading zeros. She got a map to all those ones to those ones have to be part of your list.  was that  2  functions  There are infinitely many functions out there. So, you know your function might be different from mine the function I'm thinking of.  Has kind of like a nice ordering but it doesn't matter that. It's nice. It's just you need to you need to convince me that every everything all the bit strings will appear in the list.  This is not going to work.  Let's do another one anybody else.  Okay, so let's Lambda and then what 0 and then one?  Okay, good. This this ordering is actually called standard.  string  ordering  Okay, and the rule is that if a string has more characters than another string right, then it comes later in the order and if two strings have the same number of characters, then you go by.  There's a few words for it lexicographic order dictionary order or if you just using binary strings numerical order think so.  Order all of the strings of the same length in numerical order and then start with the zero link strings one like strings to my screen. And so this is clear that all the strings will appear any questions.  Would you be able to play like an inverse a function from back to that person?  Play what you talked about this first one, okay?  so that would  be a onto function.  Frank  because you're going to map like for example, you're saying like the function f inverse would be like f inverse of 1 one would be equal to 3.  after the greatest one more  10th anniversary like summertime  345 Shipley Road, Intervale  cylinder line up after 1 year one.  See you doing with another function two functions any like zipper. I'm together. Okay, I see that that could probably work you.  maybe after maybe after kind of  Define it a little bit more formally but yeah.  Okay, so we're all in satisfied. This is a countable set. Okay. How about this thing? Oh shoot. This is a typo.  Okay 0, 1 infinity. This is the set of all infinitely long binary sequences the sequence that starts out 0 1 0 1 0 1 in alternate zeros and ones the whole way through that's an element right you could set, you know, the sequence of all one sequence of all zeros and infinite sequence is in this set. Okay, so my claim is that this set is uncountable.  Okay, let's prove it. We're going to use the same type of diagonalization argument we did before.  Okay, so the proof is that we're going to use contradiction right contradiction.  Suppose that a 01 Infiniti is actually countably infinite then that means that there's a bijection from the the positive integers to every element in 01 Infiniti right talk to in order to get to a contradiction. We're going to show that this function is not onto.  Are we going to do that you find something that can't be mapped to the same diagonalization argument we did before.  Can you guys can probably see where it's going to?  So I'm supposed to have this dysfunction and let's say that this is how it starts out looking like, you know apple one is this thing I have to is that thing after 3 is nothing so as an exercise to you guys, what is a sequence that is not in this list.  Try to think if you can like use the same type of argument we did.  in the previous class  any thoughts  Set 01.  Oh, but so we want to find an infinite sequence that's not in the list. Right? Because what we're trying to claiming is that every infinite sequence shows up in this list. So did this prove it? We're trying to find one that's not in the list.  Okay, good. It's just like we did before right so consider this sequence D D1 D2 D3 and it follows this rule DIY is equal to one if the Eye Centre of FMI is 0 so you just change the diagonals, right?  And so she is not going to be the in the list because it is different than every element in the list. And for this particular example here D is going to start out like 1010 to change everything.  Hey, therefore it's not countable any questions about that.  She is not in there like it's are you talking about Still the One?  Yeah, I suppose that you gave you gave me an infinite list of sequences and you told me I didn't miss one. They're all in there.  Then I say well, what about Dee Dee's not in there.  Because it's different than everything in your list.  Kind of like the subtle way of doing it and what I'm going to do next. I'm hoping we'll kind of clear up a few questions because you might say what's so special about infinite sequences. How come we couldn't use a diagonalization argument to show that 01 star was countably infinite. Is anybody wondering that?  Frank let's go through that.  Here's a diagonalization proof attempt. That's not going to work. Okay.  Because the 01 star is actually countably infinite and if we try to do the same thing, you know.  If the diagonals station argument actually did work then we show that 01 star is uncountable, which is not true. So the diagonals ation argument is going to fail somewhere. So I wanted to just pretend what goes wrong when we try it.  So let's set it up the same way suppose. I have a bijection from Z + 201 * right and I and I list them out.  now let's do the same diagonalization thing if my first element is 0  Change it to a one. Okay, if my and then the second element if it's a one change it to a zero and let's just make a rule that if there is no element there.  Then make it a zero, I mean.  The what we're trying to do is build a string that's different than all the strings. Right. So if a certain string ends and you have you know, you have a bigger strength and they're different. So this will kind of solved that problem.  And then there's a zero-star change it to a one and so on.  Using the same argument now D is not in this list, right?  So everything has been the same. So what is the catch? Where does this go wrong? What is something that kind of?  Breaks it.  exactly  So we built this this string D. That's not in the list but D is not finite. So it's not even in the set, right?  So that's kind of.  I'm hoping that maybe clear some things up and maybe doesn't confuse you more but  Yeah, I know that. These are the type of questions. I always have when I see something new I want to say. Okay, when does it work? When does it when does it not work and why?  Okay, so let's move on. So this is just right what's wrong with this argument D is not a finite string.  Saudi is not in 01 *  question  So let's do just a little summary of cardinalities.  So we have on the left side. These are all.  Finite cardinalities and everything in the same Circle has the same cardinality 01 has the same cardinality of a b, right. They all have cardinality to this middle one. They all have cardinality one. Right this one. They all have cardinality 0 then we get into the infinite cardinalities everything and just circle has cardinality countably many.  The real numbers the interval 0 1 the power set of the natural numbers Diesel have cardinality.  Well, it's actually called the cardinality of the Continuum. We're not going to really need to know that so much but let's just write it out. This is countable countably infinite.  cardinality  of Continuum  and then this thing  this is the power set of the power set of the natural numbers. So remember we always said that the power set of a set will always have a different cardinality than the set. So this is an even bigger infinity than the cardinality of the Continuum and you can keep on playing this game and get bigger and bigger and bigger infinities.  As far as you want to go by just keep on taking the power set.  Alright, let's move on. Okay, so let's talk about some new functions here. We've shown that the real numbers are.  Uncountable, the integers are countable. That means that the cardinality of the reals is bigger than the card. Now the event of the integers this means that there's an onto function from artusi. I mean, in fact there are many many many onto functions from Martha Z, but I want you guys to think about one just take like a minute. Talk it over with your neighbor.  Come up with an onto function from artusi.  How would you do it?  If you have numbers.  You have a decimal number?  Okay, great. I mean that's the that's the one that we're going to look at actually. Yeah for sure.  Has a special name.  Goodwin  does anybody else think about that one? You just take the decimal expansion of the number and you erase the everything after the decimal?  Is that on two?  Write every integer can be mapped to if you do it that way, right is it well defined.  Yeah, right. You can always do that with any real number. You can just truncate it is at 121 certainly not but that's not what we're asking we're asking isn't onto okay, so I might actually talk about a more well-known function call Floor.  This is the function that Maps every real number x to the greatest integer less than or equal to X so it's like it's like this truncation.  Function except for a kind of behaves a little weird when you have a negative number. So if the number is positive it just truncates it, right. So it just takes away the decimal portion. I ain't the floor up I is just three and if you just put it in the dryer in there, it's just equal to itself.  What about the floor of negative?  8.74  Write this is going to be -9.  kind of a little funky in that regard, but  I don't know.  I guess in computer science. It's rare that you were taking floors of negative numbers.  It just know that doing it with the negative numbers is kind of weird.  Okay, so that's the floor function. There's also something called the ceiling function, which is kind of the opposite right your your your new map every real number x to the least integer that is greater than or equal to X.  And so it's it's not truncating. It's just kind of its kind of  Rounding up always rounding up, right? So right you round up from there you get three you round up pie you get for you round up 7 you get 7 same thing you round up. What about -8 Point? What was it to 7?  -8 you round up? It's kind of like a weird thing.  All right. So let's talk about some properties of floor.  Which of these following statements is true?  Can you can talk it over with your neighbor if you like?  Okay good.  A lot of you guys are saying more than one, right? Okay. So, let's see which ones are true.  and  but you're going to be easier to show which ones are false, right? Because to find something that's policies are all Universal statements. You just need a counterexample. Okay, so I threw them how about a is a false or true?  False why?  Oh, so you let X and Y both be point five.  4.6  0.6 floor Plus or the floor is 0.6 + 0.6.  Is the floor of 1.2?  Which is one right good. What about the floor of 0.6 plus the floor of 0.6?  0  0 + 0 0. Okay, so this is not true.  Okay, how about be?  2 * 5  straight up  Okay, the the floor of 2 x 1/2 right is the floor of one? Okay, good. That's one.  I get a different color here so I can separate it. Okay, how about the floor of two times the floor of half?  Is 2 * 0 which is 0 okay, good. This is not true either. Okay. How about sea?  You think it's true?  True will prove it in a minute. How about D?  Yeah, we just disproved it with the previous. Thank me.  Okay, so only see is the only one that's true.  Okay, and let's let's go through the approved quickly. I'm going to use some other examples some other properties of the floor. Okay. So if floor of X is equal to that means that X has to be in between + + + + 1  prank  and if floor of X is equal to end that also means that I have to be in between x -1 and X but kind of makes sense.  do you have  Some real number X. It's got to be in between some two numbers, right?  and if x minus one is over here then you know and is in between those and those are in between an okay good so  So let's prove this x + n.  prank  Let's say this is equal to some k.  then  K has to be less than or equal to x + and which is strictly less than k + 1.  right  Charlotte subtract 10 from all the size and we get K - 10 is less than or equal to X is less than K - 10 + 1  K and N are both integers here is real and K are integers.  Okay. Now what is this mean? This means that the floor of X is equal to K - +  Solve IT 4K and you get that the floor of x + n is equal to K.  And since end of the integer and is equal to its own floor so x + 4 x + 4 then is also equal to K. Okay, so then we get that.  The floor of x + sin is equal to the Ford ecosport.  That was the dumbest Parts scene in the last night.  Okay.  What's nice about floor and why is it relate to computer science? What we've actually sort of seen it already right? When we did the the div operator que div be is actually the floor of Q / B.  right and  What type of programming languages do you guys use in the intro of introductory classes? Java C C plus plus those type of things.  And Java which one?  And Jabba two.  Wait, did I already say Java?  Okay. So in any of those programming languages when you just write without any kind of if you if your if you have two integer values like in two values and you divide them.  What is it give you does it give you an inch value?  The real value is not an integer, right when you divide two that two integers. It's not always going to be an integer but your computer what it's doing is taking the floor. So you want to do those operations. Then you have to be careful. I don't know if anybody has ran run into this before but you have to be careful about all these things, right the floor doesn't commute with the operation. So can I have to do some mad or just change everything to floats right? That'll that'll be fine.  or do I  right just be like a right b a different type but that's another thing floor also comes into play when we were talking about. How many bits does it take to store information or how many bits does it take to represent? A certain number is the floor of the log base 2 of end and then plus one.  Okay, let's do an example of a structural know a strong induction.  Using the floor function and using recursive functions. Okay. So this is going to be like a bunch of things that we've done together all put into one and I'm hoping this will be a nice example to the two for you guys. Okay?  What was the apple one is one and that if n is greater than equal to 2 we have Ativan is equal to 2 times F of the floor of n / 2.  Text before the number two is always going to be an integer, right so you can use kind of this recursive function. What are some of the first few values of f  A half of one is one that's from the base case. What is half of 2?  2 raised to x 1.  What is half of 3?  also to write  half of 4  for rent  after 5  also for  Right and so on.  Can I claim that half of n?  Say it like that. Yeah, let's do it like that half of an is always greater than or equal to end.  And I think I made a typo in the slides.  Is that right greater than or equal to less than or equal to n?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Good question, though.  Everyone is always less than or equal to and is that  the good let's prove it prove it using strong induction.  Okay. So, how do I set up a strong induction proof?  basis step  is what?  Half of 1 is equal to one and that's less than equal to one good done inductive step.  Okay, so let K be some integer greater than or equal to one right assume.  for all such that  time is in between 1 and K.  That F of M is equal to or shoot me is less than or equal to m.  want to show  that F of k + 1  is less than or equal to k + 1.  I think this is just a standard way to do proof by strong induction. How did I know that I'm doing is proof by strong induction. Is there any clues in the problem that tell me that strong induction is where to go and that regular induction won't be enough.  Right exactly. So you're right you're half of an is dependent on F of n over to roughly.  Which is often times much less than n -1. So if your function is only dependent on N -1 that's when you can do regular induction because you're going up one step at a time. But this one if I want to go to the next step in my have this ladder here.  I really look at the kind of the middle rung. So I need to know something about all the wrongs in between in order to know something about the Middle Run.  Okay good.  Okay, so that's just what I said before now. Let's do the proof.  Okay, and the proof is just mainly algebraic but let's go through it step-by-step. Okay. So this is the definition of the function the recursive definition.  I'm starting from this side and I'm trying to work my way over to the right hand side. Okay. This is a recursive definition of the function. Now, what do we know about the floor of pay + 1/2 it lies in this range, right? It's always going to be in between 1 and K.  rent  So if it's in that range and this is the range of talking about.  Bennett if I could taking the place of that an okay, it's in that range by the inductive hypothesis. We have this fact.  aren't we have the fact that the fact that were trying to prove Okay, so  Plug it back in we get this is the recursive definition.  This is by the induction hypothesis.  Okay.  This here is just a property that floor of X is always less than or equal to X.  Cuz we didn't say that explicitly but it should be.  It should come intuitively, right the floor of X is always got to be less than or equal to X.  So that's from floor of X is less than or equal to X and then this is just algebra.  simplify  10th and then we just have a string of equal equalities and less than or equal to so you get there any questions?  Okay good.  Okay, we just have a few more minutes left. I want to introduce a new subject and then we'll maybe you guys can think about it over the the break.  The subject of trees which is also a very important structure in computer science.  A tree is a special type of graph and when I say Graff, I'm not talking about a xy-plane. I'm talking about a  a discrete math version of a graph which is a collection of vertices and edges. You can think about it as a network like a social network right where you have people are vertices and they're connected together by an edge if their friends or if they know each other or whatever like that computer networks.  You know, there's there's a bunch of different things that in computer science. We need to use grass for even like Road networks or  you know networks of Transportation those kind of things.  Okay, so a tree.  Is a fully connected graph with no Cycles, which means that there's only one path between each pair of points.  And you'll learn more about these things a little bit later, but we'll just start you off with a few specific examples of trees. Okay. So there's these things called rooted tree where one of the vertices is a root and  Sister tree where one vertebra Texas the roof. These are very important also to use for data structures. You have binary search trees are rooted trees you have  What are some other good ones Max heaps and heaps? I don't know if you guys have done any of those, but those will come in in your classes.  Okay, so a full binary tree is a is a set that's recursively defined. Okay. So if we have a recursively defined set then we can do structural induction on it. And that's kind of where we're going with this. So here it is. We have our bases step.  solitary node  is just a is a full binary tree.  I like just a Vertex with no edges. We just will will designate that with a diamond.  And the Kurt recursive step if T1 and T2 are both full binary tree's then you can make a new binary tree of new full binary tree by connecting to the root of T1 and the root of T2 up to another route. So you have T1.  Here's the route and T2. Here's the route.  Now I created a new Full binary tree.  Let's go through some quicker question, which one of these is not a full binary tree.  Do I have a b and c and then if you want DNE over here more than one or none of the above?  Okay. Good. See anybody have any reason why I see is not a full binary tree.  Okay, good a property of full binary tree's is that every vertex that's not a leaf, which we'll talk about in a minute has to have exactly two children which means it has to have exactly two edges going out of it. This vertex here only has one Edge coming out of it. Okay. So another way to say it is each vertex either has no edges at all coming going down or has exactly two so it's either zero or two. That's kind of property of these.  Okay, so  The next thing we're going to do is talk about a function that send the the set of all full binary tree's to the set of integers how we going to Define this function. It's at and what is it supposed to sort of account or what is it supposed to keep track of and this is going to be the height of the tree k, it's another way to say that is it's the number it's the length of the longest path from a root to another vertex. Okay, and the length meaning the number of edges Okay, so  The height of the solitary tree is 0 right because the the longest path from a Vertex to another vertex where there is no path really right just passed from it to itself going to be zero.  Okay.  and I guess that was a quicker question that I  I know that's not that's not right. Now. This is fine. Okay the height of  T1 T2  let's just say what it is. It's going to be the maximum.  for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
