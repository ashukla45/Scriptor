  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast a lot of the stuff that you learn in this class will be relevant for CSE 21.  And then again for CSE 101 and then again for CSE 105.  105 is the theory of computation.  You basically talk about these sets of strings that can be recognized by these machines that you build.  And then you make the machines more and more.  Sophisticated until you get to a machine. That's basically a computer.  no, it's not similar to machine learning machine learning is more about how to  yeah, use used is more like data science stuff right how to use data to have the machine figure things out about the data reveal some some some nice qualities or something. Yeah. It's a lot different.  Okay, so where we left off last time? I don't know if you guys remember but  We were trying to do this problem of every collection of six people includes a group of three people who all know one another or a group of three people who are strangers to one another. So the idea is to focus on one person. Okay, let's say you're one of the six people and you focus on yourself.  So you can split this up into two cases, right?  Are you know at least three people?  Or you know at most two people, right?  Kind of like you can know 02 to five other people.  and so this includes knowing  three four or five people and this one focuses on knowing  Zero one or two people right? So often times when you do these proof by cases, you're trying to prove over a whole set of of different choices and we'll talk about set theory later. But just bear with me here. So there's there's six different scenarios that you could yourself how you could be related to the people right? You can either no 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 if you split it like this and you show that both are true. Then you showing them that it's true for the whole set.  Okay, so let's do this one first.  So suppose, you know three other people.  That we have these other two people out here, right? Is that six people?  Okay.  Do the people that you know, do they know one another?  Not necessarily, right? So now you have to break it up into two more cases, okay.  so among  the three people, you know.  Right. Okay. So what are the two cases?  What if a pair of those people that you know know one another?  Then it's true, right because you and those two people will be a set of three people who all know each other. Okay, so either  one pair  nose  each other  or  nobody  nose  each other  if nobody knows each other then what?  Right. So it's either a group of three people who all know each other or group of three people who are all stranger. So if nobody knows each other than they were all strangers.  What kind of makes sense?  Okay, so  We did this one. Let some let's think about this one. But instead of doing it this way we can think about it more as like a graph problem.  Okay, and we haven't really talked about graphs. You'll do more of that in 21. There's one is presented as kind of like a tool to help prove something.  Okay, and so the idea here is I want to let's say this is me.  I know three other people.  So I know these three.  So if any of these other people know each other like that, I get this triangle right this red triangle. And so if I get a red triangle, that means that all those three people know each other. Okay. Now what if instead of not drawing the lines as strangers, I'll just draw them as blue edges.  case of these guys are all strangers strangers strangers strangers strangers  and a set of three people who don't know each other is a blue triangle Okay, so  Not that this is going to be something that I'm testing you on. I just want to kind of give you a sense of how some of other proofs are made you you read to find the problem in terms of a simpler structure that you can work with self this problem.  Will is the same problem as in this type of graph if I color all the edges red or blue? Will there always be either a red triangle or a blue train?  That's the kind of idea and so case to I want you to do as an exercise, but think about exactly what you're doing. It's kind of just the opposite as it's a it's as if you're talking about the red.  Edge's in case to you're talking about the blue edges and since the whole problem is symmetric between red and blue. It doesn't really matter.  At most one weight what at least three others and then this one should be at most two.  What if you only know exactly two people?  That's one of the cases.  rights of the cases are  cases are  I know.  exactly  1% of 0 people  one person  two people  3445 right. So all of these things are  Are possible are a possibility and so the 3-4-5 is here is taken care of by this case and the 0-1-2 is taken care of by that case.  Okay question.  What do you mean subtract the cases won?  I don't know if I understand.  Okay.  Okay, let some let's start with like the the main part of today's lecture. What are we? What are we learning today? Mainly proof by contradiction fallacious proofs and also other types of proofs that that you can see, okay.  We're going to do a constructive existence proof. And then if we have time, we'll do a few proof by pictures which are kind of like  sort of a little bit more informal, but they still kind of  Demonstrate the validity, okay.  So which proof do you use while that's kind of going to be up to you with practice? Okay.  Overall strategy, do you believe the statement?  You believe the statement is true.  If you do the try some small examples just to kind of confirm. I mean, it won't it won't prove it. But you might run into an example that it's not true and in that might help.  So determined determined a logical structure and the main connective right determine kind of the how to translate it into logic that's going to be helpful because it might be nice if it's a implication and it's really hard to prove. It might be nice to turn that around to the contrapositive and that's easy to do if you know the structure  Okay, you need to get all of your relevant definitions. You need to know them or at least write them down.  and then  Go back into your notes and see how to do each proof Technic. What do you assume? What is the goal?  I'd say start with the simplest and move to the more complicated when you get stuck.  Okay, what are we seeing so far?  If you have something that's like for all x p of x.  Can you consider some arbitrary acts in the domain you prove that pfx holds for that element and you only use the facts about that generic X read that generic element that you have.  Created I guess.  Okay to prove that all for all x p of X is false. You just need to find one counterexample.  K&N the existence proof sort of the opposite. So there is an extra property at PX. You just find one specific example, and then to prove its false you need to you need to show that for an arbitrary acts that thing fails for all of you for that arbitrary acts. And the reason that they're opposites of each other. Is that the Morgan type law?  Okay, so if you want to do an implication proof If P then Q you assume that P is true then you use those assumptions and definitions to logically get took that Q is true.  Alternatively, you can prove the contrapositive assume Q is true and Q is false.  Okay, if you need to prove a statement of two things both X and Y you need to prove X and then you need to prove why this is kind of like the proof by cases in a way.  Peso to prove a statement of the form at least one of X and Y you can you convert it to if not asked then why or you can convert it to the equivalent version? If not why then ask peso?  Just kind of like what I said before if you can change it into the the The Logical proposition and symbols, then you can manipulate that around and turn it into other logically equivalent statements, which may be easier to prove directly or false proof. Take a look at this I start with  -2 is equal to -2. Everybody can agree that my assumption is correct, and then I get to 2 is equal to 1.  Is that true or false?  False right? So if I start with something true and every logical step is valid.  Then there's no possible way that I can get two false statement. So what does that mean about one of my logical steps?  It's not valid right? It's not.  It's not sound its it wasn't it wasn't it? Wasn't a allowable step, right? It wasn't a  A step that you are allowed to do. Take a look at this for a minute. See if you can spot the difference.  What's pop the problem?  This is not a clicker question.  Did all those ABCD any those are just what are the steps?  Caso -2 is equal to -2. I can rewrite both of them as one of them has 4-6 and one of them is 1-3. Is that okay to do?  Are you sure?  Yes.  Maybe this is a clicker question.  All right, let's do it as a clicker question.  Okay, which  line  is wrong.  I guess we all know that.  8 is fine, right?  Can I put this right over here take a minute to try to convince your neighbor of which thing you chose and see if we can all agree on one.  All right. Just want to sort of gaining some momentum. Anybody want to make a comment.  chapter 8. Include the two and one which is not the case because 9/4 equals 3/2 square, but 1-3. Squared equals -1  Which is with what you said talking about the one for which is not the case wait a minute. So you're saying that  When I expand this 1 - 3/2 squared I should get 1 squared - 3/2 write - 3/2.  Plus  3/2 squared right which is 1 - 3 + 9/4  What about the other one?  Okay, 2 - 3/2 squared is 2 squared - 3 - 3 + 3/2 squared.  Hey.  Actually, the factoring is actually okay.  All right. There we go. The Deez went out what happened with d?  Right when you take square roots, you got to take the plus or minus, right?  Not necessarily one or the other and you can see that by what's inside right 1-3 have and that's why I think what you were going for 1 - 3/2 is -1/2 2-3 has its positive one and it's true negative 1/2 squared is the same as pasta when I swear that's true, but you can't just take the square root of both sides and expect them to be equal all the time.  All right, so that's good.  So  Okay, here's the here's the idea.  There was one of those lines that was false and it made the answer false. Right? So we're going to try to leverage that. What we're going to do is make one of our lines in our proof balls and and show that the answer is false. The only line that we make false is going to be our assumption and if we can get that the answer is false. Then we know that we got that what we assumed was false, right if every other logical step is sound  Right, then we look for the mistake, but the mistake was the Assumption. And so that means the assumption is false, which means that your original thing was true. Okay, so that's called a proof by contradiction and we'll go through the details. Okay. So, how do we  when when do we want to start doing the proof by contradiction? Okay. Wait, so wait, let me let me do something real fast.  I want to take this slide.  actually, let's  Okay, proof by contradiction to prove a statement of any form, you can assume the statement is false and then every logical step you do must be sound then you get to a false statement.  Then you know something in my proof was wrong. It has to be the Assumption. There's there for my assumption must have been true in the in the first place.  Okay, so we're going to do it with this problem here.  I'm going to talk about rational numbers real number number is rational if there are integers p and Q with two nonzero such that are is equal to P over Q is the square root of 2 rational.  Okay.  Kind of fix between d and e all right.  So Dee says no actually the answer is no Square 2 is not rational. No because when we write it as a fraction squared of 2/1, the numerator isn't an integer, so that's not necessarily.  It doesn't necessarily make a number irrational. For example, you can write the number.  0.5 / 1. The numerator is not an integer, but this still is a rational number.  Okay, so it's actually know for another reason we have to prove it.  so  If a number is rational, then there are these integers p and Q that you can write it.  Are is equal to P over q. And here's another thing that is true about rational numbers is that you can write it right p&q so that they have no common factors, right that's just called reducing the fraction can always do that. It's in its simplest form.  Okay, so I want to prove that sqrt of 2 is not rational.  and so  if you try to prove this directly, you're going to kind of get stuck because the the direct proof says okay. I need to show that there are no pair of integers p&q such that \u221a 2 is equal to P over Q to do that you'd have to do this proof by exhaustion, but there are infinitely many integers and so it would never end.  So a way to resolve those kinds of things when you get stuck, you can't prove it by exhaustion cuz there's too many things. You can't really prove it directly.  Cuz it's kind of hard to do you do this proof by contradiction?  Did I do so let me do a simple proof by contradiction first, and then we'll move on to the square root of 2.  So here's the statement there exists. No integers a B for which a 18 A + 6 B is equal to 1, okay.  so actually  we're going to do this by proof.  by contradiction  Okay.  So assume that the statement is not true. If it's not true, then they're do it. Then there do exist integers A&B for which 18a + 60 is equal to what?  18 A + 6B is equal to one. Okay, good now.  I've got a sumption. I'm going to circle it that thing is false. Everything else. I do that's based on this will be a true logical step. Okay. So the next logical step in going to do is do some algebra. Let's divide Everybody by 6. And you get 3 A + B is equal to 1/6.  stop  What can I conclude from this 3 A + B is not an integer?  Right because 1/6 is not an integer, but because I'm just I'm just adding A's and B's together. I'm adding integers together by the closure property of addition and multiplication 3 A + B has to be an integer but 3A + B must be an integer.  because  A & B are integers  k  so notice that  I've said something is true. And I've also said that same thing is false and so a proposition cannot be true and false at the same time. And so we must have done something wrong. But everything we did in the steps was right. So the only wrong thing that we could have done was the thing in green there for the statement and green is false, which means that the original statement is true. So contradiction here.  So now you can conclude.  that there  exists  no integers  A&B  for which  18 A + 6B is equal to 1 any questions.  Let's see how it works for the square root of 2.  Go to is not rational.  So it's not possible to find these integers that's hard to do. Let's do contradiction. Okay assume that it is possible to find p&q to make sqrt of 2 equal to P over Q.  Dang, so I assume that we have these integers p&q additionally.  We can assume.  p over Q is in simplest form  right, which means that you can't  You can't what is it called reduce. Thank you. We can't reduce it. So that means that.  p and Q  Are relatively prime or let's say share no common factors.  share no common  factors  greater than one  good.  So let's do the proof.  shop we have  key integers  p&q such that  P and Q are the let's let's just use the math notation. The greatest common divisor of p and Q is 1  and P over Q squared is equal to 2.  All right. So at this point this is just the set up now. So now let's do some algebra and see if we can get to a contradiction. I mean if we were just going to do this if you were going to do this kind of Fram from scratch, you may not know where it's headed. You may not know what statement you're going to be proven false. So you just kind of have to explore and see how it goes.  Okay, so p squared / Q squared is to that's fine, right?  So that means that  P Squared is equal to 2 Q squared.  Okay good, right everybody following  so this means from last lecture this means  means that  Chi Squared is what?  even Steven  so  let P Squared be equal to sum even number to X B.  Oh, no, sorry one more step. Sorry.  B squared is even  so p is also even we proved that on Wednesday.  So let P equal to to be for some integer.  Be okay.  following so far  then  Chi Squared is equal to 4 B squared.  Square bolt size  Squaring both sides is fine taking square roots of both sides.  Okay.  So now for the now for the punchline  we have P Squared is equal to 2 Q squared. So for B squared is equal to 2 Q squared, right? This means that to be squared is equal to Q squared.  Which means that?  Q squared is even  in a few squared is even what does that mean about you?  Who is even?  So pink you were both even so that means that the greatest common divisor of p and Q.  Is not one.  That's your contradiction because something in your assumption that you claim to be true you've shown that is false.  Or another way to say it is what you shown is that the greatest common divisor of p and Q is both one and not one that's not possible. So all my steps were sound except for my  My assumption and therefore my assumption is false, which means the original statement is true.  Let's do you say contradiction?  And then I'm kind of running out of space here. I'll just do the conclusion of here conclusion.  Square root of 2 is not rational.  Okay questions.  Say what?  Yes.  She's selling the car.  I don't think that would.  So you're saying p squared over 2 is equal to Q squared?  but that's that doesn't  Does that do it?  That just means that P Squared is even  Oh, you know what I should do if here is sorry. There's one thing I need to.  reiterate is that  And Q is not 0 right.  Frank that's why it's important to do.  Okay question.  You want to assume the opposite and then you want that to lead to a contradiction contradiction is whenever you have a statement, that is both true or false.  So in this particular example, the statement is the greatest common divisor of p and Q is one star show that that statement is true and false.  So the statement you get to is kind of a mystery until you get there, right? I didn't know that that was the thing that I was going to prove false write other things in might be like you proved that maybe one of them is not an integer anymore. That's what we did with the previous example, right? That was the contradiction was that 3 A + B is an integer and it's not an integer. So that was a contradiction.  Okay, let's do another example.  At least three of any 25 calendar days chosen Must Fall in the same month of the year.  You guys believe that?  Well, let's see what I would work with a proof by contradiction and to try to prove this directly.  You would need a lot of paper, right?  Choosing any 25 days out of the 365. There's many different ways to do that, right? So it might take a long time. How do you know that you didn't miss something? Okay. So let's do let's let's throw it around and do a proof by contradiction proof.  contradiction  they supposed  that be the statement is false.  Okay, what is that mean?  That means that in any calendar there is at most two days out of these 25 days right or in any calendar month, right? So  this means that in any month.  there are at most  today's  right  So then if there are 12 months, then there can be at most 24 days.  Slsa in 12 months.  There are at most 24 days.  Okay.  For this contradict the assumption that there were 25 chosen days. Okay, so  but there are 25 days.  contradiction  the conclusion  is that  The original statement is true.  Because that's the that's the negation of three or more days.  I can at least three the the negation of at least three is at most two.  Okay.  Do you guys want to do another one?  There are infinitely many composite numbers.  Is another proof that's like this where you say there's infinitely many primes that's in the book. If you want to look at it. It's another great proof by contradiction and this one is nice because it talks about infinity and finite right kind of the differences between those two things which is a topic. We're going to get to later on in the class. Okay?  This would be very very hard to prove by direct proof, right?  Just keep on going until you can't go anymore.  Okay, let's do proof by contradiction. Okay, so I assume  the statement is false.  This means that there are finitely.  many  composite numbers  Okay, if you don't know what a composite number is it's kind of like the opposite of a prime in a way. It's a number that has more than two factors.  at least three positive factors  Okay, so they're finally many composite numbers.  that means we can kind of put them in a group right or set so  Let C be the set.  of all composite numbers  Okay. So what I'm going to do is multiply all the numbers and see together. What do you get?  A bigger number that's also composite, right?  So now you've shown that there's a there's a composite number that's not in this set.  We claimed that this was the set of all composite numbers. That's the contradiction.  Young Thug worth it  Do the same thing and say like okay even number and then just continually swear it and will always be there to get some positive and even numbers always positive.  That's too that's true, too. Yeah for sure you mean yeah, and even numbers always composite and you can you can do this sequence. That would be kind of saying. Okay. Let's say this instead of all composite numbers is finite right? That means there's a greatest one, but you can exceed that greatest one with any power of 2.  Okay, so fill in the details.  There is so for the one that the the proof I was saying there is one thing you have to show before you can do it is.  You must show.  there are  at least two composite numbers.  Can you could do that by example 4 and 6 done right then you can go with it.  Okay.  quick quicker question  a triangle can have at most one obtuse angle. What would I what would I have to say in order to start a proof by contradiction?  Did the Geisha of that statement which is what?  Okay, good. You guys are getting the hang of it.  Okay, good suppose a triangle with two obtuse angles cuz it has two obtuse angles also has three angles that also has two so you guys can finish.  Okay.  We're going to we're going to end on kind of a silly proof. Okay?  Are all positive integers interesting?  Was certainly one is interesting. Right? I mean, it's one it's like the you know, just one number and of course to is interesting, you know, you got binary you have, you know, a pair 3 is interesting maybe go through maybe you could find an onion uninteresting number.  I asked my wife and she said 46 of course and I was like well, maybe you're right.  But I'm going to try to prove you wrong cuz I claim that all positive integers are interesting and how am I going to do that?  Right. I assume that there is at least one not interesting number, okay?  So there's at least one then there is a least there is a least one, right? There's a lowest one. Let N be the lowest like the one with the lowest value for positive non interesting number with the lowest value.  The least not interesting them for me. That's pretty interesting to have that as a  Has like a a property right the pretty interesting property if the least not interesting number. I mean, you can't say that about any other number.  What's up?  There you have it all numbers are interesting. Now this this is a silly proof and I I mean  this is not something that's like very  sound and it's because the the word interesting is not very well defined right? It's more of just kind of like a silly thing. But this is a good proof by contradiction type structure structure is sound if if you're allowed that weird interesting.  definition  Okay. See you guys.
