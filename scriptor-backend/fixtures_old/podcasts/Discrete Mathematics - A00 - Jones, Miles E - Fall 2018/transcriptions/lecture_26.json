  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  this thing needs to be  on okay.  Good.  now  good morning, everyone.  What's up?  is that  Oh, you're just you're going in blind, huh?  What is going on with my connector?  technical difficulties  Really?  You know, I did run over my connector with my office chair this morning. I wonder if that like  Caused it to not function correctly.  All right.  That's unfortunate.  Oh, there it is.  excellent  Okay. Sorry about that that start guys.  So today we're going to continue with equivalence relations, maybe go over some some of the examples again just to kind of get you guys  comfortable with working with like the arithmetic properties of  the congruence classes modulo m  And then we're going to look at a few applications of this module om thing and you can see that the applications are very relevant in a lot of computer science Fields before we go into it though. I wanted to share a few common issues in homework 6 that may be relevant for homework 7 and may be relevant meaning for the final and even for classes be on this.  Text to the first thing I wanted to.  Bring up is this whole notation of functions? Okay, what's the difference between F colon a goes to Y versus F of Y is equal to a  Okay, that is the good reason that we brought it up.  There is a difference.  Okay, good. Yeah, exactly.  When you write this this is to Define what the domain in the codomain are so a is domain.  Why is codomain?  This here is a rule. It tells you what where the function f Maps the element a  weather that you know in this is going to be  how f  functions  on input a  and in this case a is an element of the domain write a is element.  domain  why is element?  codomain  Got any questions about that?  Another one. What is the difference between these two sets?  Okay good. So on the left, you have the set containing just one element FFX right and on the right you have the power set of FX and  there's kind of a bit to unpack from this particular example.  And I would like to kind of address it and there's these are the type of things that when you see a problem and you see us using certain notations. There's certain things that you can assume based on the notations were using for example if you see this  What can you assume about FX? It's a set. Right? So in this case you can we can assume here that F Maps some set. Let's say a  to some other set, but say be I guess.  using the notation from before  and I mean if this if f of x if you could take the power set of all the f of x is then you can now assume kind of that be  Is a set of sets because we're saying when you plug in X into the function f hit Maps you to a set and then you can take the power Set of Lights app.  Okay where this is just the 2nd changing one element, whatever that is doesn't have to be any particular type that could be a number they could be a set. It could be a graph. It could be a tree it could be whatever.  I can't questions about that.  Okay.  Little bit of cardinality review. This is fish help you with.  proving things about the cardinality of sets and you know we  We tried to Define certain relationships between cardinalities equals less than or equal to greater than or equal to those are defined in terms of functions, which is not a way to show that the set s is countable. Let's go through each one of them create a one-to-one function f that naps as to a where a is known to be accountable show that s is a subset of a countable set a  show that the cardinality of a s is less than the cardinality of a  where a is known to be uncountable.  List out all the elements of s or more than one. Let's take a look.  okay, so what kind of  Collecting on this. Oh, yeah, you can change the colors. So cool on see. Okay. So why is she not a good way to show that the set is countable.  Okay good.  They'll yeah exactly. There are different levels of uncountable uncountable sets. I think you said it best guy. So for example, you can have Z  is less than  the power set of Z.  And the power set of Z is less than the power set of the power set of Z, right?  So we have an example where the power set of Z is uncountable and it's less than strictly less than another uncountable set it still accountable.  questions about that  all these other ways are valid. In fact, all these other ways kind of are all special type special.  types of this one  This is like the classic way to show that something is on count that something is countable right is to do that one-to-one function and then u c and d are just special ways of showing that question.  Accountable why you showing there is a bijection or show that have been taken.  Okay, good. Good question. Why do we have to show that there's a bijection instead of an injection so  I mean, I guess if you show a bijection then then you have the injection part for free.  the breaks  right  so that was more because  the existence of onto function gives you the less than or equal to.  So let's just show.  Kind of give an example.  It's a good question.  We showed that there is no bijection.  from our two  Z Frank  that's the way we went. Yeah, cuz we tried to  I'm from Z2 are so that way.  so  we showed that this is not on to right and so it's not a bijection, but we didn't do anything with the one to one part of it. Right? And so  Let's say let's just kind of recall what it means if F from A to B.  Is onto then.  Cardinality of a has got to be greater than equal to cardinality of B.  This is how we Define onto so if we showed that any function you try to make is not onto.  Let's go here.  There is no onto function.  From A to B.  That implies that a cardinality is not greater than or equal to cardinality of bee and the opposite of greater than or equal to is strictly last night.  Yeah.  right  It just shows that in this case. I just shows that the real numbers are strictly greater than the countable numbers countable and uncountable set.  A good question. Alright, let's move along. Do I have how many much more do I have?  Oh, yeah.  Which is not a way to show that the set is uncountable.  Critter onto function this is just what we talked about right onto function from a jackass where a is known to be countable uncountable show that a is a subset of a square a is known to be uncountable. Right? These are kind of like all the Opposites of sort of what we saw before show that X is equal to the power set of a where a is known to be accountable show that all attempts to list s will always miss at least one element.  Okay, this is kind of like a tricky question because you have to make sure you understand all of the wording. Exactly. Okay, let's look at sea.  Does anybody remember what types of sets are countable there's two types.  It could be what?  Finite or countably infinite.  Thanks song.  If if the set a is finite then the power set of a is still fine. I try so that's not a good way to show if I changed it to countably infinite. This would be a valid way to do it.  questions  onto function from s to open a to ask where a is known to be uncountable.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  You're right. I meant to put one-to-one function, but  you're right. This one is not a way to show.  Because you can write this will this will imply that the cardinality of a is greater than or equal to the car. Now, I've asked if I change this instead to be create onto function.  f-from s2a  where a is uncountable.  This would be a valid way to show it and could good observation any other questions?  Okay, one more little note that I want to give you guys is about the homework. We're going to make a post about it on Piazza. It was a little bit of confusion about the JavaScript programs when we say all valid JavaScript programs were talking about  All possible valid JavaScript programs as opposed to all JavaScript programs that have been written by a human or computer cancel all valid possible JavaScript program. So if you have questions about this, then look at the Piazza post that we're going to post about it. It's just  just kind of  a confusion in the in the way the sentence is worded. Okay, so all  possible  JavaScript  programs  I guess I should say all possible valid.  JavaScript programs  so there might be a job a script program that are part of the set that have never been written before. Okay, that's kind of  Okay, let's do a little bit of review from what we had before we have the sense of this could be the equivalent classes based on the modulo M. Okay. So we say that a is congruent to b-mod and if  M / a - be if there's some Q wear as a minus B is equal to q m right like a minus B is a multiple of M. And this is how we write it a is congruent to b-mod am. Okay. So for example, we have five is congruent to 2 mod 3 write 5 is also congruent to  -1 mod 3, does that make sense?  Does that mean that 2 is congruent to -1 month 3?  Yes, right because it's an equivalence class. So.  5 is congruent to 2.  fibrous congruent to one that means that 2 is congruent to -197 is congruent to 92 mod V so the kind of a difference between this in the mod function that you  Are used to is that now we can we can compare any two numbers, right? They don't just have to be numbers in between 0 and M -1  Okay, so just to remind you guys the congruence classes or the equivalence classes based on this equivalence relation. We write it as bracket Subban and this is the definition.  K a brackets of M is the set of all numbers that such that a relates to ask another way to say that is that a mod m is equal to ask Martin.  Or a is congruent to ask Martin to all like different ways of saying the same thing. For example, the class zero sub 6 is all of the multiples of 6 all of the integers that are congruent to 0 mod 6.  Okay, another description of this that might be helpful in your homework. Is that a sub and is the set of all MK plus a  Such that K is an integer right? It's all of the all of the numbers that when you divide out by m the remainder is a  Okay, so  will will just briefly go through this again. We already talked about him, right? You can basically multiply the two numbers and then take the mod or mob the two numbers multiply them together and then take them out of the result.  So we already did this one, right?  And so the idea was  you split it up.  And we have five times five times my date.  * 5 * 5 * 5  my date  this whole thing, mate.  Canyon  you guys can come do that again as an exercise. We also did a 2018 to the 2018.  And tried to find the last digit so I just wanted to get you a little bit more practice with this. So I I looked up the zip code of UCSD.  92093 so what's the final digit?  In this number ready go?  Let me know if you have any questions on on how we did it before I can give you guys a hint if you want.  I don't look it up on the Wolfram Alpha. I maybe you can look it up to check your answer.  You guys remember the  The process that we went through for the other one.  What do we do?  Are you at what's the first step to do?  Yeah, figure out what the pattern is right before you do that though. We can just kind of we can simplify this right 92093 to the 9209 3 mod 10 remember that's what we're doing get the final digit. This is actually equal to 3 to the 9209 3 mod 10 and the reason because of that is because it's just a sequence of multiplications of three with it with itself. And remember those multiplications. You can kind of do them you can mod them out first and then multiply them after.  Okay, then good. We found some sort of cycle.  Okay. So let's just write out a few examples. Okay, 3 to the 1 mod 10 is 3  3 squared mod 10 is what 9 3 cubed mod 10 is what?  732 the fourth mod 10 is  One right from 80132 V mod 10 is does anybody know?  Three right you could just actually do three to the fifth. We should what 243 or something or you can use the the multiplication property and just say OK 3 to the 5th is 3 * 3 to the 4th three to the fourth is Montana's 143 of 5th, March 10th is 3  text now we're back to 3 and  We're just multiplying by 3 over and over again. So you just going to get this pattern repeating.  +39-713-971-3971 Okay, so  What do we do now?  Okay, good figure out what it is.  92093 mod for and I think it's what one.  and then just go into your  Your list and see what happens when you look at 3 to the power whatever we know food for the power K mod for is equal to 1 cups equal to what?  I guess I should put the mud right?  4 is equal to 3 to the 1 mod 4.  Go to three questions about that.  Because the the cycle repeats itself every four times and that's not something that you could you could you should know like just from the problem. It's something that you should figure out as you as you find out this pattern.  What is it?  Oh my God, 10 francs. Thank you.  Is it possible for some number we could get like 3 to 5 Mod 10?  I saw this the  Oh that the pattern doesn't Loop. No, it's not possible because because you're always just multiplying by 3 every time. So once you get back to something that you've already done, you're still doing the same action on it. So you'll still get the same result.  Can any other questions?  Okay, let's move on.  Okay. We already looked at this right?  What's so let's just skip over this cuz we already kind of talked about it. But I do want to just reiterate this the things that are allowable and things that are not allowable. So a minus B mod m is equal to a mod and minus be mod in mod episode. This is good subtraction is fine. So Division and exponentiation. It doesn't have this nice property.  write in Pearson counter-examples something about exponentiation that we can use is this and we used it already a to the B mod m  is equal to a mod m  to the B  Martin  Right, and that's exactly what we used to do that 2018 exam.  questions  Okay, good. Now let's look at another reason why modular this modular arithmetic is useful these modular equivalence classes and this is going to come in handy for the homework for sure. Okay.  So it's a way to do proof by cases. Remember? What proof by cases is is you split up your your space of possibilities and consider each one of those possibilities. That's a separate case. So one way to do to prove things about integers is to split up the integers into whatever their equivalent classes is mod for or in the homework mod 6, right or whatever whatever is going to be useful. In fact, we've done this already many times when we do it mod to that's when you break up the integers into evens and odds. So we've already kind of seen this this is just kind of generalizing  Okay, so the claim is that the square of each integer is either divisible by 4 or has remainder one upon division by 4.  Okay now.  The sort of proof that we want to think about doing writer induction. This is a this is a property of integers. So you want to maybe do that there's contradiction. You can't actually do exhaustion because you don't have enough time in the world to to try everything, right? So what we're going to do is proof by cases.  so the idea is  let N be an integer and consider its remainder upon division by our and in this case our is equal to 4 and there's really only for possibilities and these are the four equivalence class.  So  case one  n  mod for  Is equal to 0 and I could say this in many different ways, right and is congruent to 0 mod for and is in the congruence class of zeros of 4.  Okay, so a nice way to translate this into something mathematical is that and is equal to 4 k for some K and Z, right?  then  and squared is equal to  16 K squared  and so  N squared  mod  4 is equal to what?  It's zero, right because and squared is divisible by 16, which means it must be divisible by 4.  I mean another way you can write it is that and squared is equal to 4 times for K squared and that might make it more clear which congruence classes should be in that case 2.  and mod for  Is equal to 1 then and is equal to 4 k + 1/4 some K in z?  Then and squared is equal to what?  16 K squared plus what?  8 k + 1  this is equal to 4 times for K squared plus 2K.  All plus one and so if you write it in that form, it should be obvious that it and squared mod 4 is equal to 1.  Can't no contradictions yet. Right. What was the claim was that any integer squared mod for is either equal to 0 or 2 one? So this is fine so far.  Okay, what's going to happen when you have?  Kh3. I'm just going to get myself some more space.  Kh3 is that in mod 4 is equal to 2 so that means and is equal to 4 k + 2 4K in Z and now and squared is what 16 K squared plus y.  16 right  16 k + y 4  That's equal to 4 x 4 K squared plus.  4 k + 1  in squared mod for now is equal to zero again. So still no contradiction and now case for  and mod for is 3 and is equal to 4 k + 3 4K in Z and squared is equal to what 16 K squared plus you have a 4 * 3 so that's 12 oz 24K + 9  And now you can see what's going on. Everything is divisible by 4 except for 9 and 9 is congruent to 1 mod.  4 * 4 K squared + 6 k + 2 + 1  And squared model 4 is equal to 1 peso everything not everything squared mod for is equal to 0 or 1. Now. I know that this is a tedious kind of problem and I'm in sort of a tedious proof to do but it is easy, right? It's it's easy and you can be sure that you've covered all of your bases. So that's what the power of this type of proof is for. It's really too kind of just try out all possible things without actually doing an infinite amount of work. Okay any questions  Okay good.  Okay, let's look at another application here pseudo random number generators.  so  it's actually quite hard for a computer to make a random number.  Frank cuz I computer is the kind of like this deterministic machine it needs to kind of do something right has to  It has to have a rule to follow. So how do you make it follow a a rule? That's unexpected. When you want the the random number to be some number that you don't expect. So one way to do this is to use the pseudo random generator where it's that every time you ask for a random number. It'll give you the next number in a certain sequence. Okay, and the send the sequence of numbers is supposed to be sort of random and sort of Random.  It's actually not random and that's why it's called pseudo-random. Okay, so one way to generate this sequence write the computer will generate the sequence under the hood, right so you don't get to see it. But every time you ask it for a new random number it gives you the next number in the sequence. How do you generate the sequence?  Well you pick up modulus you pick a multiplier.  And you Pickett increments and then you pick a seed number. Okay, and the idea is  What you do is you take your seed number.  Whatever it is, you multiply it by your multiplier and then you increment it and then you mod by m that's what this is saying multiplier increment it mod by Ann and then you get the next number in the sequence.  So then to get the next one you plug in whatever you had in back into your sequence generator.  so  We're not going to like go through exactly how you know all of the math about why why this is like a useful thing or why it actually makes things pseudo-random, but let's look at an example.  If you choose 851 at 1 then you get this sequence.  Hey, it's kind of nice because it goes through all the numbers exactly once right and the numbers sort of seeing random right it's kind of hard to.  To predict what the next number is based on all of this information ranks hard for us to kind of see that but you have to be careful. You have to pick the numbers especially being in a special way in order that you don't get something like hear that all the just get a bunch of ones cuz that's not pseudo-random anymore.  shop  There's kind of a more of like a question to think about about these things.  What's the maximum number of terms before the sequence starts to repeat?  Should have seen something like this already.  Okay, we can use this example as an example. How many terms did I have to go through until it repeat it again. All eight terms and one reason for that, right? Is that because  Because there's only eight possibilities, right and whenever you reach a possibility that you reach before it will just do the same thing and it'll follow you. So it'll follow in the same in the same sequence.  Cancel for this to be really nice and work. Well, you want your number am to be really really big right so that you kind of get a bunch of different numbers.  Okay question.  Say it again.  Yeah, that's a really good question. If you have a list of numbers, how do you prove that? It's random randomly generated. It's not it's not something that you can really do for certain. You can kind of give a percentage of like how you believe it to be right? It's like some sort of  Yeah, there's like a bunch of things that random sequences you expect them to have but it's not 100% certain that they have them so you could say oh this like let's say that you flipped a coin a bunch of times right and you give me the sequence of heads and tails, how am I supposed to know that you just didn't make up those?  About that sequence. Is that kind of along the lines of your question? Yeah, so there are certain things that I would look for. For example, I would expect the number of heads and tails to be very close, right? That's one thing. Another thing that you wouldn't expect is suppose you you flipped a coin. Let's say a hundred times.  It is more than it's probably I think it's like around I'll have to check it out. But I think it's around like 80% likely that you'll flip a heads.  I think five times in a row at some point. I think I kind of like look for these things that you expect to see but that's like a kind of a whole other subject to  to to do and it is not an easy question to answer and this is this is kind of why pseudo-random numbers are are good enough for a lot of applications.  But they're actually they're actually really weak if you want to eat if you want a base like a security on pseudo random numbers, right? Because somebody can kind of crack your crack your code on how he know they can look for patterns and crack it.  and I mean kind of  yeah.  Sure, exactly. So there's a few ways kind of ball.  There's a few ways around. This one is you pick the number am so huge that it never it will never repeat itself in a reasonable amount of time. Another way to do it is to change your your seed numbers every time.  Okay. Well, maybe not every time but every once in awhile and a way that that a computer can do that a lot of the times what it does is if you if you ask a computer for a random number, right? You have to click if the click and say go. So what it would do is whenever you click it'll take that time stamp and use that as a seed to the random number generator.  So it kind of like uses this sort of, you know, like the milliseconds that you clicked at.  That should be a random number right unless you're like very aware of when you click.  Hey, so this is I mean, this is a huge topic that you know, we could have a whole class on but I just wanted to show you kind of a neat little application that it's actually used.  Okay, so  maybe we'll look at the next application on Monday. We're going to look at hashing. How do you take a bunch of information and kind of?  Store it in a abounded amount of memory.  Have a nice weekend everyone. I'll see you guys on Wednesday most likely cuz then is going to be substituting on Monday.  San Diego podcast "
