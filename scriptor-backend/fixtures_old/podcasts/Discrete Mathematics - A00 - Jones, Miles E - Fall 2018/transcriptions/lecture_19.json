  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Okay, welcome everyone.  so  let's get started. Today. We're going to  Do some more induction. Are you guys excited or?  I'm hoping that  Today, we basically go through a bunch of examples, you know, so.  it's kind of the  let me just do this real fast.  It's kind of the way that you can go to these problems, right you could have seen this already, you know with a lot of different kinds of mathematics and arithmetic algebra. All these things just like induction takes practice. There's a lot of things that you can like learn and memorize about the structure and stuff which also takes practice to know when to change the number and stuff like that.  Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to start out and we'll start out with a connection between strong induction and regular induction. It turns out.  that  any universal statement about natural numbers, right? This is this is the this is the type of problem you can do with induction, right? So any kind of statement that you can do with a strong induction.  Why is this the way I wanted to go?  What are the other way?  I guess this way is  The start here, okay.  Okay, if a universal statement can be proven with regular induction, then it can also be proven with strong induction. This should come as no surprise, right?  Strong induction seems like it is actually stronger and you are proving you're using the same.  You are using the same.  hypothesis in a way because regular induction  is like right you want to show that show. 0 write the basis step and then the inductive step is p of K implies PRK + 1  Frank strong  induction  you have the basis step which is p of 0 and then you have the inductive step which is p of 0 and P of 1 +... And pee of  k  implies.  So notice here.  That we're doing pfk and play puke a plus one. That's what really what we're doing here to in a sense. It's like part of strong induction.  So  what else do we want to say about this?  Yeah, you just assuming more in the strong induction hypothesis. What's surprising is that?  Any universal statement that you can prove a strong induction, you can also prove would rather regular induction. So this may come as more of a surprises and not as obvious Okay, so  I'm going to justify this for you.  So let's just kind of think about some arbitrary problem that you can solve using strong induction. Okay. And so remember all of the problems that were proven with induction. I have this form for all n greater than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to some value then some statement about an and then the proof by strong induction. Looks like this. Zero is true.  Then for all K greater than or equal to 0 0 and and an n p f k all of this implies pfk plus one, right? So we needed a lot more assumptions in order to prove P of k+ one whereas in in regular induction. You only need one assumption. So how is this the same how can you kind of simulate strong induction with regular injection?  Okay, so the idea here.  Is that we're going to Define this new statement Q of n k?  Cube event is this whole thing. This is still a statement about the integer n but you just Encompass everything in there.  Okay, so  What are we trying to how do we frame this in the sense of?  Induction vs. Strong induction. So let's do a regular induction oncue, okay.  So you do Q 0 is true.  But Q 0 is the same as p 0.  So essentially you proven.  Proven that P of zero is true.  Okay good.  Okay, stop now if I prove Q of K implies Q of k + 1 what is it that I'm what is it that I'm actually proving?  I'm proving that.  2 of 0 of 0  NPR one  and... Pfk  implies what P of 0 and P of 1  And.... And P F K & P f k + 1.  so  let's go back to what we learned like the first few weeks about logic.  essentially what this is is  Cheetah car basically what this is is some sort of logical.  Statement that is like well, forgive me for using p's and q's again, but let's do Little P implies Little P and Q.  So does anybody know how to simplify this statement?  What is it just P implies Q?  Let me just use our colors better.  This is the same as  P implies Q  Okay, so this is just like a little aside but it represents the whole thing. Right? Cuz this whole thing is Little P.  Also right here.  missing thing hears Q  But essentially that structure so we can change it to read.  P of 0 + P of 1 +... And Pete okay  implies pfk + 1  which is exactly the thing that we wanted to show using strong induction.  Pretty cool, huh?  What's the next question if if if you never need strong induction, why do we need to learn it?  rank  Well, it makes the proofs nicer right? It's  It's more of like a Style Style eyes way of writing the proof. It's sure you could have done it with regular induction. But it turns out if you do it with regular induction using this sort of simulation, it turns out to almost be the same argument.  just kind of a matter of  structure molecular structure of your proof  Okay any questions?  Okay. So let's look at some examples of things that now that we can prove with induction. So the division algorithm.  Proof that using induction the Russian peasant multiplication induction the largest and bit binary number is 2 to the N -1 the correctness of the base B conversion that we did in the first few weeks.  And any integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes. These are all really great exercises for you guys to try.  So all of these are in the book, I believe maybe not the Russian peasant multiplication, but there's some page numbers here for reference some of the more exercises. I think some of them are written out. Like I said practice is a really good way to get comfortable this material. So if you're only doing the problems on the homework, you know, that's good. But if you want to  Kind of get better then do some more practice problems. We're going to do some practice problems today in class 2 so you can base your proofs off of those.  All right good.  Okay, let's start with this concept or this theorem. Every positive integer can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is this is what the whole base to system is based on Frank.  for example  What about the number 12?  Well, what's 12 in binary? So it would be 1010 which is 2 to the  3 +  I'm sorry 1100.  223 + 2 squared  My claim is that any integer can be written in this form.  And the consequence of that is that you can write any integer into binary in some sort of binary.  Okay, proof by strong mathematical strong mathematical induction.  Basis step. Okay.  Turn this down.  Bassist at what's my basis step and how do you know where to start?  at 1 y 1  right because I said every positive integer so you can replace this with like every and greater than or equal to one integer Okay, so  1 is equal to what? What can I represent one with powers of 2?  how  220 K good  dumb questions  Okay, so let's set up our induction step.  Let K be greater than or equal to one and now we want to.  Oh shoot. Okay assume.  For all Jay such that Jay is in between 1 and K that J.  Can be written.  as  a sum of distinct  powers  of to I'm so sorry for the long winded assumption. This is necessary. Right? We have to write this in some form. This is basically saying my claim is true for one my and my claim is true for 2 and it's true for 3 and all the way up and up 2K.  Okay, so what do I want to show? What is the statement? I want to prove from this.  Okay, good. I want to show that it's true 4K plus one. So I want to show K plus one can be  I'll just write it out written.  Ask some distinct powers.  Okay, good. So how we going to do that?  Let's think about it in another way.  And then if it's odd you can say all the time.  221 + 1 + 2  Yeah, that might work.  Something like that.  Right. It's either going to be even or odd if it's even it's a multiple of 2 and if it's odd, it's a multiple of 2 + 1.  This might help.  Okay, very good point.  If K can be written as a distinct sum of powers of 2 can't we just add to this year. Oh, well what if K already used to the zero?  and then we can  yeah.  Wait, let me insert a new slide so I can write write all that down.  What happened?  Oh, yeah, you don't.  Okay.  Where was I? Oh, yeah, so you can do case one.  K + 1 is even though we wanted to do?  Let's do it this way even so that means that k + 1 is equal to 2 times. Let's say C4 some  integer C  right  What do we know about sea?  She's got to be in between 1 and K, right?  Because pay is bigger than or equal to one. That's what we that's what we decided here.  Stop the lowest I could be would be lowest point could be is too and so we got that rental is in between this range. That means that the statement holds true for C. So this means that by the end by the inductive hypothesis.  C can be written.  as distinct  powers of 2  so k + 1 is equal to what actually let's write it out. Let's write out what it would be good be like C is equal to 2 to the A1 Plus 2 to the A2 plus all the way up two plus two to the let's say a I don't know em.  Just some sequence of there 4K + 1 is equal to 2 C which is equal to 2 to the 8th.  That's what I meant to put them on.  I can come on now A 1 + 1 + 2 to the A2 + 1 + 2 to the a.m. Plus one and that's still a distinct. Those are distinct powers of 2 because you just added one to a distinct sequence.  Okay case 2.  K is odd  2 + 1 is odd, right? That means that K is even  if K is even then there's no way that it could contain the power of two two to the zero right to the zero can't be part of its summation because I have to be distinct powers of 2 + 2 to the 0 is the only odd power of 2 and so you can't have only one odd number if you're in this formation. Okay, so then  K does not involve  2 to the zero in its expansion  so black  k + 1 be equal to k + 2 to the 0 write the expansion of a + 1 more.  games that kind of makes sense  any questions  because this value C.  Why is it strong induction is because of this value see right? It's so member regular induction is only one you can based your proof of k+ one just on K. We can do that on case 2 which is fine. But case one we needed to go back farther than K cuz basically C is k+ 1/2, which is not.  It's not exactly K. It's in between that range.  Any other questions?  And this is like a standard thing to do is to put it up into cases when you need to okay?  An upper bound of primes. This is kind of a funny theorem.  Suppose the sequence of primes is P1, P2, P3. It's it's just the primes in their order in their ordering from smallest to largest. Okay?  So for any positive integer n the nth biggest Prime has got to be less than 2 to the 2 to the end.  This shouldn't be super surprising. This is like a huge number and it's actually like a really huge upper bound. We're going to show that it is an upper bound. Okay?  proof by strong induction  basis step  Kp-1 or let's say I want to show want to show that P one is less than 2 to the 2 to the 1 is that true?  Yes, right because 2 is less than 4.  inductive step  Okay, so let K be greater than equal to one.  assume  Why does it do that?  For all Jay such that Jay is in between 1 and K.  Kiesub, J is less than 2 to the 2 to the J.  And what do I want to show?  P sub k + 1 is less than 2 to the 2 to the k + 1  this is kind of a acute proof here.  What we can do right now is  How do we do this again?  Okay, so what do we know about P to the k + 1?  Oh, that's how it yeah, that's that's what it was. This is this is really funny. Okay, what do we know about P to the piece of k + 1  it's time rank.  actually, we can argue that piece of paper plus one is got to be less than P 1 x p two times... X PK + 1  so the reasoning behind this is that  this number here P1 X P2 X PK. This is kind of the worst case scenario to get to the next prime.  if you guys  let's just say it like this this number this big number that we have here. It's is not a multiple of any of those first Prime's right?  Say that way.  this thing  is not a multiple.  of P1 P2 such-and-such up to PK  So that means it must be a multiple of a sum of other Prime that's bigger than all of those.  economic sense  and so in the very very worst case we can say that PK plus one is less than this thing and we know from the inductive hypothesis that  this number is less than well.  This would be 2 to the 2 to the  1 * 2 to the 2 to the 2 * right... * 2 to the 2 to the k  plus one  and you do a little bit of algebra here you get to to the 1 + 2 squared + 2 cubed +.  2 to the k  and  PC here  What's the weather like this?  Sorry, this is getting a little messy.  This whole thing.  Okay.  So the sum of all the powers of 2 is equal to 2 to the 2 to the k.  + 1 - 1  and this is less than 2 to the 2K + 1.  So there's a few few tricks in there that we used.  This one sure.  I guess.  Is that actually true for yeah, it's actually true for 2 to 3, right?  Okay.  some days I mean  Main thing I want you to get out of this is the structure right boob the algebra. Maybe try to figure out why it works. But let's move on to the next thing. Okay, so there's some cautionary tales.  The basis step is always necessary, right? That's what the whole induction is is anchored on. Okay good.  You might need more than one like you like you said up there. Sometimes you need to sometimes you need three. It depends on the problem.  Okay. So also when you look at some patterns as they go up.  From 1 to 2 to 3 to 4. It's not enough to just look at small examples in order to prove it you have to use induction one really famous example of this is what we call it like a cake-cutting conundrum, I guess.  So the idea here is to join and points around a circle and connect all of the points with cuts. How many pieces are end up when n is equal to 3 you get how many?  4 when n is equal to 4, how many do you get?  781 in is equal to 5 and he guesses.  four five six seven eight nine 10, 11 12 13 14 15 16  Any guesses for n is equal to 6?  That's a really great guess.  It's wrong. It's 31.  Try it out. You'll see.  doleful  So here's some practice problems to look at some kind of common pitfalls. Okay. So the next thing we're going to do is a fake proof. So I'm going to give you a fake theorem and a fake proof and I want you to figure out where is the problem now, we can all agree that this theorem is false.  for all n greater than 0 if x and y are positive integers with  The maximum of X and Y is equal to end then X has to be equal to why that's not true, right?  Okay. So here's my proof by induction. Okay. Basis step. Does it hold for the basis step?  And that's the first place you want to look right?  Max if the max of X and Y is equal to 1 then.  Both X and Y have to be one because I said that X and Y both have to be positive integers. Okay, then I'm done. Just wondering as soon as they're both one.  Okay, here's the inductive step fix K to be greater than zero. No big no big deal assume that whenever Max at XYZ equal to K.  Then X is equal to y That's the inductive assuming the inductive hypothesis. I want to show that if they if X and Y are positive.  integers where Max of X and Y is equal to k + 1 then both x and y r k + 1  What I want to show.  Here's the proof.  Fix X and Y are positive integers with Max of X and Y equal to k + 1 okay now.  If you subtract 1 from X and you subtract 1 from why then the max of x minus one, why am I nice one has to be equal to K. Right because as the maximum function goes either one or the other has to be equal to k + 1 + so if you subtract 1 from both of them the maximum is going to go down by one.  so by the inductive hypothesis X is equal to x minus 1 is equal to Y -1  therefore  Wait, what just happened?  How are we able to do that we were using induction and we  we found a we were able to prove a wrong statement Okay, so  Where is the error in the proof?  Is it in the base step basic step?  Is it in kind of the Assumption of the inductive hypothesis?  so just kind of  wait notice hear that.  The colors right d is referring to just this statement here. Okay, and  See is going to this whole thing.  Is that kind of makes sense? Just kind of match the colors. So C is this fix X and Y with Max ex-wife.  And then he is this blue thing the inductive hypothesis.  Okay good.  Okay, good. We have some may be being B&D or kind of the the  Wow, they're very close.  Why don't you guys discuss it with your neighbor? See if you can kind of convince them? Which one?  Is correct or be convinced?  California  Good question then.  Okay, did you guys change your mind?  kind of  All right, let's look.  Still looks the same.  Okay, so let's go over each one of these these answers so they is claiming that the basis step is not true. It turns out that it's actually true for the bases step. Okay, so that's that one's fine that good. Okay, let's think about be  We're going to fix K. And then we're going to assume that whenever right Max of XYZ will 2K this and this and that this is an assumption so it can't really be wrong.  right  I mean, I know that's weird, but I don't know questions.  If I say I assume assume that we are all dinosaurs living in the prehistoric time. Is that a false statement?  It's just an assumption right and then I can maybe base my logic off of that. But you know, it doesn't matter if it's true or false. It's just kind of something like that. So that's something good to keep in mind is that you can assume whatever you want.  It's helpful. If you assumed the right thing because then it can prove the induction. SOB is fine to actually how about sea?  Fixed X and Y are positive integers with Max x and y equal to k + 1 this is fine, too.  He just assumed that that is you could do that. Okay? Okay, then it goes to D. What is wrong with d?  There's actually nothing wrong with d.  Right if X and Y if Max and X and Y is k then Max of x - 1 - y - 1 has to be what did I say? Sorry, if if Max of XY is Kate plus one then Max x -1 - y -1 has to be K. That's that's actually that's actually fine, too.  So, what's the problem?  I'm using that statement and I'm claiming using the inductive hypothesis. That x minus one is y is equal to Y -1. Why is that not okay to do?  so  why doesn't it follow the assumption?  It breaks somewhere. It breaks for a certain value only about way you can eat for both of them are the same value for masumeen that that's the case is that they're always the same whenever they're Max's this number right? I'm going off of that assumption, but what doesn't fall into the assumption?  As of definition beginning this was like what effects does zero?  What Texas want to kill why is not right? So right this is going to be bad, right?  So here's the problem when K is equal to.  What did I say when K is equal to 1 right?  then  it could be the case that  Okay, what's the best way to say this?  Let's do it this way X and Y have to be positive integers, right?  But x X - 1 + y -1 they may fall out of that range, right? So my assumption is based on X & Y being positive integers, so I cannot use my assumption when X and Y are not positive integers and there's a possibility that accent either X or Y is 0 in this case.  No, I don't have X and Y I have all I have is that X and Y have to be positive integers that's in my assumption.  Well, I mean the the step D is actually correct, right if Max X Y is k + 1 then Max x -1 y + y -1 has to be K. I mean that's just like an arithmetic State arithmetic truth.  Write the moment. I try to eat to use the inductive hypothesis on it.  Pretty crazy, huh?  Okay.  Well, I'm almost out of time here.  I wanted to maybe get to one structural induction proof. So.  I have another fake proof that you guys can look at.  That involves Pangea.  You know the supercontinent from Mike.  How long was at a hundred million years ago?  How many?  He leaves ago. Let's do a structural induction proof real fast so that we are we've cut we've covered all the cases has an aspen 2x + 1 is it has my claim is that XX mod for is always equal to 3.  Is it going to be a valid proof?  Okay.  proof  Bye.  structural induction  Okay.  so basis.  3 mod 4 is 3 good.  Play is the only basis element. So you have to do the basic step for every of the basic elements. This one only has one.  inductive step  Okay.  suppose  X is some arbitrary  element  in s such that  Xmod 4 is equal to 3.  So this is kind of how you set it up and then what you want to do if you want to show up that for every single rule.  the resulting element  still has this property. This one only has one rule so it's going to be pretty easy.  some  Maybe I'll just write and print the Seas show.  that  the result  of every  rule has property.  Okay, then.  X is equal to 3 k for k + 3.  for some  K an integer K, right  and  the result  of the first rule  is 2 * 4 k + 3 + 1.  This is equal to 8 k + 6 + 1 which is equal to 8 k + 4 + 3 which is equal to 4 * 2 k + 1 + 3.  so therefore the result is  What's the result in. 4 is equal to 3?  Okay, so  this kind of running out of space here.  San Diego "
