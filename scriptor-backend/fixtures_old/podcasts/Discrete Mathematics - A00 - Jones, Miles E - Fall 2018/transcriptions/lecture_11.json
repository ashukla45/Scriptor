  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  All right class. I'm having some.  technical difficulties  Anybody access the internet?  Is it just because of this room?  you are  Alright, I need the internet in order to start.  end task  I just did something bad.  I think I need to restart.  Sorry.  I'm sorry. Yeah.  Usher  If this works.  tiger tiger  I won't connect automatically.  What is going on?  Show all of my other things are opening up.  Okay here.  All right. We're getting it all together now.  Pier One that's connected. Let me open something here.  But yeah, okay.  Okay, let's see it worked.  Okay. Thank you.  Oh, here we go.  Thank you.  Alright, let's get started.  So there's one more proof that I wanted to do before we move on to the next lesson. The next lesson will be sets and we're going to  Look at sets today and also talked about how to prove sets are equal. So she'll help you out in your homework.  Okay here it's kind of a funny proof.  Do there exist two irrational numbers X and Y where X raised to the Y power is rational.  So at first glance it might seem like no it doesn't seem like it right.  You seem like they're rational.  But the proof that I'm going to present to you. I'm actually not going to tell I'm not going to be able to construct an answer. I'm not going to be able to say okay. Let X be this let y be that this thing is rational and I'll prove it alternatively. What I'm going to do is an existence proof. I'm going to prove to you that there exists a number X and a number y that make this rational but you're not going to really know what they are. But you're going to be convinced that they exist. Okay.  So here's kind of the question.  Okay e to the I pi.  is equal to -1  But we're going to limit irrational to be real numbers.  But that's a good answer. They'll have you guys seen that before.  No.  It's just a identity erase to the I Pi power where I is the imaginary number is equal to -1.  Kind of surprising, right?  Okay. So how am I going to do this existence proof? Let's let's say that a rational means it's a real number that is not rational real numbers that  are not rational  Okay, consider.  square root of 2 raised to the square root of 2 power  Is this rational?  Who knows it's really hard to tell.  What would we would have to do would be find a p and a q such that P and Q are both integers Q is non-zero write the whole thing about rational numbers.  Okay, well.  Let's see.  first let's  suppose  that sqrt of 2 raised to the square root of 2 is rational.  This is like case one.  If it is rational, then we're done. We found a pair of numbers where One race the other rational then we are done.  Okay case 2.  Let's suppose.  That sqrt of 2 raised to the square root of 2 is irrational.  Okay. So this is what I'm doing here is I'm looking at both possibilities cuz I don't know which one is true. I don't know if it's rational or irrational if it is rational then it's fine. We found one if it's irrational then what we what can we do?  then  I guess let me just remind you what's going on here. I'm setting X to be equal to square root of 2 and Y to be equal to square root 2.  Okay, so if it's irrational set X to be equal to square root 2 raised to the square root 2 and let y be equal to square root 2.  So what is square root 2 raised to the square root 2?  Mason scrimmage  Square root 2 raised to the 2 is what?  2  which is rational  you guys get this the the proof?  the square to raise the square to his rationale, then we're done if it's not rational then it's irrational and if it's irrational then that number raised to the square root 2 is rational, so  it might take a little bit of time to absorb really though the weight of this statement, but I noticed that I have proved the  the statement without actually giving you an example because we still don't know whether or not square root of 2 raised to the square root of 2 is rational.  therefore  there exists  numbers  Or I say irrational numbers.  X and Y where X to the Y is irrational or rational?  Okay any questions?  Okay. So, what are you doing today?  We're going to prove statements using appropriate style conventions guiding tax notation terminology. Most things to do with sets Define differentiate between an important set use the correct notation with us rhyming sets. You'll see that sets. We like to use these curly brackets because parentheses and brackets and all those other things.  Are reserved for different types of mathematical object. So when you see curly braces like that.  Most of the time that means we're talking about a set.  Define approved properties of sets relations. We're going to talk about the power set Cartesian product Union intersection. Disjoint set set differences complement all that kind of stuff.  So what is a set?  to unordered  Collection of elements okay, and unordered just means that.  If you take the set and you move things around, it's the same set.  So if I'm talking about the set of students in this class, even if you guys move chairs, it was still be the same set. You're still the set of students in this class.  Another another thing that we like to say about sets is that the elements are unique you don't have multiple.  You don't have multiples of the same element. I mean you can write them out in the set. But it just all just means the same element. Okay, so one way to  Write out a set to define a set. Is this roster notation? Basically, you just list out all the elements in the set. So if I was talking about the set of students in the class, I would just list out all your names use commas to  separate  Okay, here's a funny thing here.  This is called The Empty set.  To set with no elements K and this is very important and will come up again and again and again and sometimes it could be a confusing but hopefully you guys will get the hang of it. It also has a  another form  that we go like that. That's also called The Empty set.  So sad so very important and we use them to describe numbers but not not exclusively numbers, you know, you can talk about sets of shapes or sets of people or sets of I don't know.  Theorems something like that, but numbers do come up a lot there. They're very important to to set theory. And so we have some very specific names for numbers. Okay. So the set of all integers is called Z. Is anybody know why?  What is that?  Is the German word for number? Is anybody here speak German?  No, I don't either but I forgot the actual number. But yeah, so that's Z you'll often see it written like this Z would like a double line.  Okay, so Q is the set of all rational numbers that stands for quotient.  Okay, and then our is a set of all real numbers.  Okay, so you might need those for your homework.  Okay. So another way to describe sex is this thing called set builder notation?  Okay, and it's you put it in curly braces. You have some sort of statement about a variable usually.  Not all the time, but usually and then you have this vertical line This vertical line is red such that.  Such that I know you have a statement pfx. Okay until one way to do this is to run the following algorithm quotes on outer them because they could actually go on forever cuz there are these things called infinite sets. We've already seen some might like the integers is an infinite set and so on so it kind of Gone Forever create an empty set for each acts in the universe. If P of X is true insert After Effects into the set and then return the set.  Let's look at an example.  What is this set?  Okay. What are you guys doing here?  Okay, good the positive even integers.  And so how do we say this?  This is sad.  the set of all 2 x such that  At the such that is this is this line?  I'll take that away.  Such that X is an integer.  and  X is greater than 0  Okay, what about this set? What's this set?  the set of all P / Q such that P and Q are integers and Q is not equal to zero Okay, so  I know we've been getting very familiar with all the logic logical connectives and stuff. But when we do this set builder notation, sometimes instead of and we just put a,  All right, right now,  instead  and what is this song?  rational Sprint  Okay, good. Okay. So more definitions equality of sets days are two sets are equal if they have the same exact elements.  How do we say that in terms of logic?  So set a is equal to set B.  If and only if this is more more so of like it just the definition the definition of set equality is for all x a is in be by biconditional excessive be if it only affects S&P, okay, so these two pictures are equivalent sets right because they contain all exactly all the same elements. It doesn't matter that they're mismatched out of order it just matters. What is there and what is not there?  Okay, so we're going to talk about how to prove equality of sets in a little bit.  Okay, what about subsets?  A subset of B. That's what this  symbol means means that for all X x's and a implies that X's Envy.  So that just means any element of a is also an element of b and a lot of the times you use see the subset.  defined or described  to be like, okay, so you have be out here and then a is just inside of it right away is a subset of B. Everything in a is in b  Okay.  Is the set containing 6 a subset of the set containing 6?  And is this is the empty set a subset of the set containing 6?  Okay. Some kind of competing views.  Okay, let's go through them.  Where's my?  Is the second Team 6 a subset of the set containing 6. Yes. Why is that because everything in that set is also in the other set.  everything  In sex is in sex another way to say it is x in 6 implies X is in sex.  If x + 6 is true, then the next one is also true because there really is only one element.  Okay. How about this one? This is saying that X is in empty implies that X is in sex.  Axes and empty is always false.  So that means that this statement is always true.  It's true. What you say is true.  Thanks for the answer was a they're both true. And in fact, this is true for every set every set is a subset of itself and the empty set is always a subset of every other set.  Okay.  so  if we have that a is equal to B.  Then we can say that a is a subset of B&B is a subset of a and this is kind of the definition for equality. Right? What do we say before for equality was this?  But notice that this is a biconditional it means that Exton a implies x + B + x + B implies accident right? You have to have both of those.  So, why are these equal here?  When is the set of all p over Q such that P and Q are integers with Q not equal to zero? Why is this equal to the set of all p over q p and Q are integers Q is not greater than 0 and the gcd of p&q is one.  The same elements, right?  Another way to think about it is that the left set is a subset of the right set and the right set is a subset of the last set.  Actually, let's let's see if we can demonstrate that.  Okay, stop.  Let me let me just go back here for a second. Okay, so let's call this set a and set B want to demonstrate that equal.  Now it's pretty easy to show that b is a subset of a right.  because if it if an element is in B, it already meets the criteria of being an a  So let X B&B.  Oh, we didn't talk about this notation yet. Did we?  Well, we have it.  Okay, I'll just write it here. Okay, X is an element of a this little symbol means is an element of  That's just how we write.  Okay, so we're trying to prove that.  B is a subset of a subset, okay. So let accent B&B. This is always how you start a subset proof Ledic B&B and then you try to logically get to exit in a so then X is equal to some p over Q with  p and Q integers  Q greater than zero and gcd of p q is equal to one. That's the definition of be that's that's what it means to be an element of be so X is equal to p q  With p and Q.  integers and Q not equal to 0 right those statements are still true and that's what it means to be in a  So X isn't it?  a very simple  so that proves that proves.  B is a subset of a okay. Now, let's show that a is a subset of B. This one is a little bit trickier, right?  let X be an element of a  then X is equal to P over Q.  with p and Q in z  and cue not equal to zero. Okay. So how do we get to show that x's and B?  Well, let's make a numerator.  Okay good. So you can you can do it by cases and you know, if  If p and Q follow the guidelines of being in B, then then that's fine x's and beat. If not, then you can reduce the you can reduce the fraction so that it's in the form.  so  X is equal to let's call it peep. Rhyme / Q Prime where P Prime over Q Prime is in simplest form.  Right, you can always do this. I'm not going to go through the details of it, but you can always do it.  meaning that Q is greater than zero and gcd of p and Q is one there for  X isn't be  art  Groupon  Okay, let's talk about some subsets which is not true z+ is a subset of Z. So z+ is just the positive integers.  Z is a subset of QQ the subset of RR is not a subset of Q.  Okay, good. Let's see.  See if we can get to a consensus here.  Okay. So almost all of us agree that z+ is a subset of Z. Yeah, that makes sense. If any positive integer is also an integer good. OK V is a subset of Q.  Is any integer also a rational number?  Yes, right. You could just set cue to be equal to one and then you have P / 194 p is integer. Okay, so that's right are all rational numbers real numbers.  Also, yes, right remember real numbers are all numbers that can be found on the number line and rational numbers are on there.  Answer, this is the right one.  Beginning it from another class.  Okay.  So let's talk about a little bit more about the empty set empty set is the set with no elements.  question  What is the following is not a right?  so which means our is  are you at your right?  Yeah, cuz now okay. So real numbers is not a subset of Q. So that's right. So all that's why you put a e  Okay, good. I was just making sure you guys were paying attention there.  Yea or is not a subset of Q. How do you show something is not a subset of something else?  Okay, good. Yeah counterexample Pie is in our  pie is not in queue.  I know we haven't shown that Pi is irrational, but trust me it is.  Okay, let's go back to this one. Thank you for that. Which of the following is not true?  empty set is a subset of the empty set empty set is an element of the empty sent empty set is a subset of  Where's my graph?  okay, good so which okay, so we're like  mostly saying e okay. So if you said e which of the two are you talkin about or which of the more than one are you talking about?  DMV  Okay, so it's like it be first.  Empty set is element empty set that is false. Why because the empty set has no elements, so I can't can't have anything right? So empty set.  Has no Outlets.  So this is false.  Okay, how about D4? Some set be empty set is an element of B.  This is true.  What if you let the set what if you let B be the set containing the empty set?  this is where  you know the set theory gets crazy because now sets can actually be elements of other sets.  Because subset and element of are like different.  They have different definitions subset means everything in the first sight is also in the second set element says this thing is in my set.  best element for whatever object  makes sense  No, no I said be is equal to the set containing the empty set.  Is different different cuz this set has one element the empty set has zero elements.  Saints going to get confused.  Okay, good. Alright, let's look at some operations on sets.  So there's this thing called the power set.  Power set is the set of all subsets.  stop  Which of the following is not necessarily always true?  Okay, great.  All right. Let's go through them one by one.  So the first one s is an element of the power set of s what does it mean to be an element of the power set?  It must be a subset of s already is a subset of s.  Yes, always right.  Good. This is true because s is a subset of s.  Okay, how about be the empty set is an element of the power set of ass. What does it mean to be in the power set of essay must be a subset of s is the empty set a subset of  Okay, how about see the empty set is a subset of the power set.  Exactly. True empty set is always a subset.  of every set  including itself  You can't read it, but you get the idea. Okay, empty set is an element of ass.  Not necessarily, right?  Thank you questions.  No, no empty set is not an element of s  Oh, that's for a particular be.  And I'm saying what does not necessarily always true.  Oh just because B is a very specific example.  This one is a very specific example.  this one  Okay, right. So the power set you mean 404b you mean this be sorry?  Let's look at an example.  I think that'll be helpful.  I was thinking exam.  Let's say a was the set.  1 2  8  Okay. What is the power set of a?  That is the set containing. Okay. Well, it's all the subsets. So the whole set is in there, right?  What else is in there?  Each individual sac containing an individual element, right?  What else eats set containing two of the elements, right?  Is that it?  Empty sets in there, too.  That kind of makes sense. Now. The thing is that the power set the elements of the power set or sets.  Okay, let's say B is the empty set. What's the power set of B?  What is the power set of the empty set?  Is it this?  Set containing empty set. Yes.  Portuguese, very important. Okay, let's talk a little bit more about some set operations that we can do. How do we combine some sense? Okay, we can talk about the intersection the you the difference in the Cartesian product. That's what they're called. These are their symbols and these are their definition and noticed that we're going to Define them using logic logical.  Spartacus  Okay. So a intersect B is the set of all X such that X has an A and x's and B.  And a lot of times you'll see a Venn diagram.  like this  the intersection is this part here?  It's where they intersect where the two sets intersect they so what's a union B?  Is anything that's in a day or MB?  B&B or nah  Okay, how about the difference set difference?  Is anything that's in a a minus B is everything that's in a and it's not in be so it's only this portion of the circle.  In the Cartesian product. I can't really draw the the Venn diagram.  so does that mean that it's the both of the circles the entire thing so its influence the  for the Union Yes and includes the intersection. Yes.  Okay. So what is the Cartesian product? It's basically all pairs that you can get where one of them comes from a one of them comes from me and their ordered pairs. Think about a  A Cartesian coordinate system. Okay, where maybe you have? Maybe this is a good picture to draw.  Hey, you have the y axis and the x axis and the Y goes from 0 1 2.  And the x axis goes 0 1 2 3.  The Cartesian product is all of these points.  I'm not going to drop I'm not trying it big enough to really label them all but notice that the labels are like one, three each each. One of those ordered pairs is an element of the Cartesian product.  Okay.  So which one of these statements is true?  each of these things  We got intersection Union difference and Cartesian product.  Okay good, which ones are true?  Amby, and can anybody give me a reason of why they're true?  Okay, can you give me a more formal reason?  Because their oars exactly thank you. So notice that these are  Defined as and a north and we already showed that Anton doors are commutative. So that means these whole things are.  Okay good. These ones are not the same. These are not the same. The Cartesian product is not commutative because the pairs have to be ordered.  Okay good.  Let's skip that for now.  Okay. I just wanted to get to this part just have a few more minutes left. Okay set complement.  Okay, it's basically everything that's not in the SEC but often times.  We want the set complement to also be in Via set. So it makes sense to create this thing called the universal set. Okay, and that's going to change from problem to Problem from theorem to theorem depending on what you're using. So if you are talking about integers if that's kind of your  Realm of of your problem. Then the universal set will be integers if I'm talkin about the set of students in the class that I'm going to get it given a 2.  Can you can think about the universal stat set as the set of all students? Okay, and the complement of the students that don't that are the students that don't get it. So it's still within this Tech.  is 1  yeah. We usually call it you okay? So the complement of a set a bar?  It's just too fine to be you minus a the set difference.  And a lot of the times you'll see it as a a box.  Write with a so this will be a and the rectangle will be the universe.  So a compliment.  Will be for a compliment.  It's going to be everything that's in the universe.  outside today  That's what complement is and the last thing I want to mention.  Are these de Morgan's laws for sets?  And I want I didn't really get to prove them. But I think that I'll prove them on Wednesday, but what I want you to get out of this.  Is notice how similar these look to the demorgan's laws for logic and if anybody notices the shape of those symbols?  How they're similar to the shape of The Logical connectives. Let's go back just for a minute.  Noticed that a intersect B.  Is you have the the and operator right? And they're both kind of like these?  pumps  where is the union and the or a sort of like these valleys? I think so.  Yeah wolf will start talking about that will do the proof of One Direction of the de Morgan's laws. It's in the book too if you want to get a head start.  Okay. See you guys on Wednesday.
