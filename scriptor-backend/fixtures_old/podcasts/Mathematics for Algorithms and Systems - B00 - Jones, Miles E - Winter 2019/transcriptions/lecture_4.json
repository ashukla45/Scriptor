    "Full Transcript": "Okay. Sorry about that class.  We'll get this thing going.  Any questions before we begin?  Here we go.  so  Okay, so let's get started this evening. Sorry for the few minutes late.  We got plenty of time to do to get through this lesson. Okay. So today we're going to go through more counting but trying to do it in another method. So this would be counting with recursive functions or recurrence relations.  So we sort of introduce this last time.  What is recursion basically solving the same problem solving a problem successfully by reducing it to the same problem, but with smaller sizes and the idea is that if you have some bass case, then you can build up to the bigger sizes by doing this step by step.  Okay, a recurrence relation. We seen these in 20. It's just a function that's defined recursively gay and a lot of the times you'll see that it's a function where the input is an integer and it's based on the previous integer. So don't forget that a recurrence relation has two parts as the recurrence and it has the base case. You need the base case in order to build up.  Okay, so we saw a few of these examples of recurrences Fibonacci numbers factorials summation of integers.  Okay, and so we're going to look at each one of these ones.  song  let's start with some addition of integers.  What is the closed form of this recurrence?  So the clothes so what is the closed form mean? It just a recurrence to get to the final answer you have to do this step-by-step thing, right? We start from the base case and move up.  Closed form just means that you just have to plug in the number and do some calculations and that will give you the answer. Okay?  So certain problems. I'm going to give you and you're going to have to figure out what is the closed form. We're going to go through some techniques on how to do that. One of them is guess and check that might be something that you went you want to do here if you if you are.  Having trouble with the answer.  Okay, so we kind of have C&D.  Is a CND.  Okay, so we're going to actually solve this one by by guessing and checking.  But before we go there, let's make a few calculations. Okay, so what is  What is s of 1?  One night.  What is SO2?  Right, cuz it's the previous one plus the number right? What about sf3?  sex what about so4  10 s a v  15  Talk does that give you more of a sense of which one it should be?  Okay. Well, let's look let some.  Correct. Answer here is d  right because to choose to is 13 choose 2 is 3  4 choose 2 is 6  5 choose 2 is 10 and 6 choose 2 is 15.  Okay, so  any questions about that?  Why wouldn't the world does summation of integers have anything to do with combinations? Does anybody thinking that?  Okay good. So we're going to look into that.  So in order to do that, let's think about what else is counted by and plus one shoes to anybody give me an mathematical object that or set of mathematical objects discounted by + + 1 choose 2.  It has sort of something to do with Pascal's triangle. That's only because Pascal's triangle and codes these binomial coefficients, right? But now I'm talking about like which set  What kind of set of objects is counted by it?  And plus one bit strings.  with  two ones exactly two ones, right?  Okay, so  let's say that.  cast of n is equal to the number of nplusone bit strings  With two wants to know how to count this. We already know what it is, but I want to count it in a different way so that we have kind of another we look at it another way.  We have this set of binary strings. What is kind of nice way to 2 divided into two disjoint sets something that we may have done already before a few times.  Okay, good. So  So we're going to split up the set into all nplusone bit sequences that start with 0 and that start with one.  Okay, how many start with 0?  Will you start with zero and then how many places do you have to fill here?  And right and how many one should be in there?  2 rights of this is the number of envied sequences with exactly two wants another way to say that.  Got any questions about that?  I know it's off by one the end minus one to end but just  Keep up with me.  Okay, how many start with one?  Well, you know that the rest of that string has to be a bunch of zeros and one one, right so you can count you can count it by how many ways can I put fish in the one?  inter and different positions  Because this there are in.  things here  So it's the starter with zero or start with one. So that's why I put a plus here.  So, what does that give me that gives me that s of n is equal to S of N - 1 + n this is the same recursion that we had before.  Good questions.  Okay, let's move on.  So yeah, so they're that's what we get. So different ways to solve recurrence. I mean find a closed form. How did I find that closed form? Well, I already knew the answer. But how are you guys going to find it on your homework and on exams are going to use one of these two methods? Okay. So guess and check is you write down a few of the first  Sequence numbers in the sequence and you make a guess if they follow a pattern then you use induction to 2 to check that is actually true.  Gardeners unraveling and we'll see an example of that which is basically like you take the recursive function and you like plug it into itself a bunch of times until you get into the base case.  So we'll see you in example of that, too.  So let's let's look at this one. Let's do the guess and check.  So we put down.  As of 1 is 1 as of 2 is 3 as of 3 is 6/4 is 10 and we also saw that for n choose to write we had to choose two.  3 choose 2 for choose 2 and 5 choose 2  So when we haven't we made a guess that as of n is equal to n + 1 shoes to another way to write n + 1 choose to is n + 1 * n / 2x. That's where I got this thing from  Deshawn claiming that this is true for all in  Hey, so this this type of claim.  It's nice to use induction to prove this right? So what's the base case?  As of 1 is equal to 1.  Space Case usually is just a base case of the recursion + 1 * 1 + 1/2 is equal to one so that checks out questions about that.  Okay, inductive hypothesis.  suppose  that for some k  greater than or equal to one.  As of K is equal to K * k + 1 / 2.  Now, what do we want to show?  want to show  That s of k + 1 is equal to what?  k + 1 * k + 2 all / 2  so that's basically what we have up here.  Play so this is this is a very standard type of induction problem. And I expect you guys to know how to do this.  Writing all this stuff down and then the the rest of it is just algebra. Okay, so I just have it up here. If you guys want to review it later. You can download the slides, but it's nothing more than just manipulating some algebraic expressions.  Okay, so now we can feel confident that we have the right answer because it would it be used induction.  Okay, let's use another method. This is called unraveling.  queso  Maybe you tried the guess and check way and the numbers that were coming out. We're really looked weird and you didn't know what they were. So instead you want to try it using unraveling. What does it mean to unravel will notice that in a  Recursion I have this function a of n but I also have a of n minus one right here.  I'm going to do is I'm going to plug a van into itself.  I'll show you what I mean by that.  Okay, so I'm going to make a little side note here.  a of n minus 1 is equal to  well, if any of an is equal to 2 times a of N - 1 + 2 to the end then AF and -1 is equal to 2 times 2 times a day of N - 2  Plus what?  2 to the N -1 it's just as if you were replaced and width and -1.  That kind of makes sense.  Okay.  What about a of N - 2?  2A  + -3 + 2 to the N - 2  And so on so you can sort of see how it goes.  Okay. Now, let's see how that works when you unravel.  so  a of n is equal to 2 times.  And in here I'm going to replace a of n -1 with with my side note.  2  8 + -2  plus 2 to the N minus 1  + 2 to the end  Any questions about that?  Okay, I'm going to label this as like level 1. Okay, cuz we're going to kind of keep on going.  Okay. So what do you think the next step is?  plug-in a + -2  So before we do that, let's clean it up a bit guy. So this is still Level one. We have a of n is equal to 2 squared a of + -2  plus 2 to the N - 1 + 2 to the end.  Actually, you know, we should do let's make this level one and this will be level 2. Okay. So the original formula is level one.  And then this next one is level 2. Okay, so level 3. What? Does that look like?  Hey event.  Oh, this should be an end to write. Thank you.  cuz that two factors  or distribute to be 2 squared.  and now I'll replace a of n - 2 with what to a of N - 3  plus 2 to the N minus 2  + 2 to the n + 2 to the n  Any questions about that?  Alright, let's clean it up.  So a of n is equal to 2 cubed a of N - 3 + 2 to the end + 2 to the end + 2 to the end.  Okay, so you can do this.  As far as you want to go, right so when do you stop so do you stop whenever you start seeing a pattern? Okay. Can you guys see a pattern forming? Okay, so if you can then what would be  the case level  it would be a 11 is equal to what?  2 to the k  A of  + - k +  k x to the end  that kind of makes sense.  Okay now.  How do we how do we end it? So this is just an arbitrary k x so we want to end it when we go down to the base case Okay. So for what value of K. Do I need to plug in to get me down to?  + -1  just do a little side note here.  Or what?  value  Okay, must we plug in.  to get  a of one  answer  k equals 2 + -1  Okay. So now you go down to the end minus one level and plug-in and -1 4K.  queso  here are the different levels at that we had from before so this would be level one.  This is level 2.  This is level three.  And this is what we said was going to be level K, right. This is just all the work we just did.  And now we set k equal 2 N -1. So this is level and minus one.  Cuz when you plug in and -1 4K you get + - + -1 so then you get there you get down to a one.  Can you get this thing here now plug-in. What is the value of a 1 what we know it is from the base case, right? They want us to  So this is equal to 2 to the end - 1 * 2 + + -1 * 2 to the end.  And you simplify that to be end times two to the end?  any questions  which Park?  Sure.  So I'll just do it from this slide because it's basically the same information night.  So the key here is to rewrite the recursion in terms of smaller values, right? So we start out with this recursion here.  That can be written as a sub and -1 is equal to 2 times a sub and -2 + 2 to the N - you understand that part.  So basically we're taking that and we're plugging it into a + -1 into the recursion. We're replacing this value here with this value there.  That makes sense.  And then this this thing that I boxed this is just kind of a simplification simplifying it a bit.  Did they figure it out? But it's it's either and -1 if your base case starts at 1 or 10, if your base case starts at 0 or 10-2 if your base case starts at 2, so depends on where your base case starts.  any other questions or  Yeah, but I like to put in the K Step 2 so you can have like something to plug something into.  So what we got at the answer, we got it. We got a closed form.  Is the closed form?  Yeah, it's like what the function is without the recursion.  I think I'm traveling is kind of a pain and guess and check is a little easier. But if you like unraveling you can use that instead there's some times where it'll get kind of messy. And so it'll always work but you might you might have to keep track of so many things and it might be hard to find such a nice pattern.  I'll give you some examples to do on the homework and you kind of see where where it's easier where it's harder.  Any other questions?  Okay, let's move on.  So here's like a game has anybody seen this game before you have like these rings that you put them on to these poles and you need to transfer the whole pyramid from one pole to another. Okay? What are the rules you can only move one disc at a time one ring at a time. You cannot put a larger disk on top of a smaller desk.  so the question I'm going to ask you is how many moves is necessary in order to move the whole pyramid over to another pole the way that we're going to start this is  Try to do it with smaller examples. Okay, so get into groups and I want you to try to figure out how many moves does it take for one disc for two discs for 3 disc. This is three different games.  Okay, ready go.  One of the first Barbie doll.  Who got one for this first part?  Should be one right?  Okay. How many did you get for two?  How much is 4 / 3?  Alright, let's see. So I have this sophisticated 3-level thing where there's a backpack and umbrella and somebody's package. I don't know who it is. I don't know who this person is. I don't know why it's here. Okay. So let's just divide the table into three. Okay, so there's one move here, right? And then let's put the umbrella over here. That's too then what do I do?  Okay, cuz it depends on which one we're going to put in the box here. Then the umbrella right and then what?  Okay, so that's three.  Then what?  4  5  sex  77 Haygood  Okay, let's plug these numbers in 137. We have any idea what these are.  I mean you could try out with for but let's try to do it mathematically or you ever guess.  15  What's a c?  Okay. So, how are we going to actually count this using recursion. Now the first thing you do when you're counting with recursions is make a name for your the number of objects of a certain size. Okay. This is very important. You see that we always do this kind of thing. So we're going to say that t of n is the number of moves to solve the puzzle with and discs made this step is very important. I don't want you guys to skip this  Cuz now we can just start talking about Tia van. We don't have to write this sentence over and over.  Okay, so the recursive solution here.  is 2  what I'm going to do is I'm going to move the top pyramid over to the next whole.  Then I'm going to move the bottom disc over to this pole.  And I'm going to move the top pyramid over there.  I guess I'm trying to get to the the rightmost pole.  But how did I move that top pyramid over I did it recursively right? Because moving the big pyramid is T of n moving just the top pyramid is what?  T of n -1, okay. So how many moves let's do this one first.  How what is this recurrence?  What are you guys stay here?  Why is it so big all the time?  okay, we're saying D good 2 x to the N - 1 + 1  right because you move the and -1 discs over.  that takes T of N - 1 steps move the largest disc over that takes one step and then move the the pyramid over again T of N - 1  Okay, what's the base case?  You have one is equal to one right this works because takes one move to move the disc over. Is there any other solution that might work? Okay.  About 1000 to 0.  It actually still works. So which bass case should you use?  Okay, depends on how you define. The problem is the problem to find on zero discs.  It could be in like a weird way, but if you say I don't want to deal with that then you just start at 1 right. I don't want to deal with that case. So let's start at 1.  Okay.  Let's do it that way.  now with with this recurrence  Let's actually plug in the values, right?  so  Teavana tea have one is 1T of 2 is 2 * 1 + 1 so that's three, right?  He does multiply it and had one. So T of 3 is going to be 2 * 3 + 1 which is 7 right?  And then we have 14 + 1 which is 15 and then we have 30 + 1 which is 31 and so on. So now we can generate all of these numbers just by using the recurrence relation.  Okay.  So the next thing we do is we want to get a closed form, right because the recruits is nice because you can actually generate any time any number you want but a closed form is better because it's faster. So anybody have a guess.  2 to the N minus 1  2 to the n  -1  so that will be our claim and now it's proved it by induction. We're actually going to prove this one using both techniques so you can sort of see the difference and which one do you like better?  So base case if n is equal to 1 then T of one is one. That's fine to the 1-1 is also one. So this all checks out, right?  Okay.  Induction stop suppose and is some positive integer greater than 1 and has the inductive hypothesis. Let's assume that t of N - 1 is equal to 2 to the N - 1 -  we want to show now is that t of n is equal to 2 to the N minus 1?  So, how do we do this?  This is what we want to show so start from this side and logically get to the next side. Okay, so we're going to start from T of n  Write out what it means in terms of the recurrence. It's 2 * T of N - 1 + 1.  replace T of n -1 with the inductive hypothesis and then just do some algebra and you get  any questions  Okay.  Let's try unraveling it. I'm going to give you guys a few minutes to try it yourself get a piece of paper or help your neighbor who has paper if you don't have any paper.  try to  what happened?  Save the trees, but why do you take notes?  Huh?  If you have the sides, then you can peek if you need help because I put the answer on the next slide, but see if you can do it on your own.  And let me try to help start you out.  So T we start out with level one is going to be just the recurrence itself.  Frank and then level two will be you plug in the the the recurrence in terms of t n - 1  and then  questions  Let me just help out with the side. Remember the side note that was helpful.  that t of n minus 1 is equal to 2 * T of N - 2 + 1  Okay, so  As you go through this, so there's a few tricks that you might have or traps that you may have Fallout not traps, but there's a few tricks that help with this and it's all about how do I simplify it in the best way so that I can easily find this pattern?  Okay. I hope that you guys have gone a few levels down. So let's do it together and I want to show you maybe where this.  This particular unraveling why it's a little tricky.  Okay, so level 2. What did you guys get to you then is two times.  2 T of N - 2  Write plus one.  Plus 1K. Let's simplify that two two squared T of N - 2  and you could just say plus 3 right, but let's let's just put  + 2  plus one  Okay, how about level three?  2 squared  T of N - 2 T of n - 3 + 1  + 2 + 1  so we get to cubed T of n - 3.  + 2 squared + 2 + 1  so you guys want to see a pattern happening?  That's why I kind of kept them separate cuz you can see that like every time you do it you accumulate another another term, right? So what's the case level?  T a t of n why does it do that?  We have to to the k.  T of what 10 minus K plus and then what  Chula K. - 1/4 to the K - 2 + 2 2 K - 3 all the way down to one, right?  Can we get this big mess of summation?  But there's this is anybody know what kind of Series this is.  No.  Got like a special name.  What is it?  geometric  the geometric series  and why is a geometric series nice because there's a closed form for it.  Okay. So what is the closed form for this thing?  2 to the K - 1  Okay, how are you supposed to know that?  It's like one of those things that you learn a few times and you may or may not remember it so I'm asking you now.  To remember it.  Going to come up again. Okay.  Okay, so  So we've gotten down to this part here, right?  This is the case level and now we just plugging and -1 4K just like we did before and we get to the end - 20 of 1 to the -1 -1 and when you plug in one she won it was one then you just get to the end - 1 + 2 million - 1 - 1 and that's to the end has one day so it works again. So those are the two different ways to solve an overcurrent.  questions about that one  Where do you learn geometric series? Is that in calculus or in?  Did we learn it in CST 20?  For those of you who haven't seen it now, you know.  Let's just write it in its its general form is this?  k equals one up to let's say end of our to the Kay this is going to be equal to  Are to the K - 1 / r - 1 and this is if far is not equal to 1.  Casey this is the general form for a geometric series.  Actually scratch that. Sorry patient start at 0.  Okay.  another example  binary strings that avoid 00  How many binary strings of length n are there which do not have two consecutive zeros.  That's basically what I mean when it say avoid Seca voiding the substring 0 0  Okay, so get to work.  Let's count them for smaller examples, right like, you know do this kind of guessing check and then we can kind of actually count them using recursion. Okay, ready go.  Remember that the empty string is a string of length 0 and it certainly does avoid 00 to get you guys started.  So Will Save The Empty string? How do I do it?  empty string  nothing. So how many legs Iero strings are there that avoid 00 there is one of them the empty string.  And now you guys can fill in the rest.  I'll start putting some in here.  length 1 what do you have 0 and 1  so there are two.  Is that what you guys got?  And then like two strings we have well 00 is not. Okay, that does not avoid 00.  but all the other ones do 0 1 1 0 and 1 1  So there are three so we have one that we have two that we have three. What do you think the next numbers going to be?  four five  That's just a lesson.  That you might need to do more than just three examples before you think you see a pattern.  Okay good. So you have five because there are three that don't avoid it, right.  And there are five that do avoided 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1.  + 010  okay questions about that so far.  You can keep on going and see if you find it a pattern.  Anybody have a  I guess.  2 to the N minus and  Okay, so is 0 is 2 to the 0 - 0 is 1 okay. One is 2 to the 2 to the 1 - 1.  But that's not what to drink.  You got the next one is 8.  It's a good guess.  any others  What we're going to do the recursion in a minute. Yeah. Yeah. That's how we're actually going to count is by using recursion.  Any other questions or comments?  2 to the n x n x n  Oh.  like two times and plus 1 choose 2  Let's look at the recursion.  Okay, remember the first step?  Give your your the number of objects and name. So let's safety of n is the number of binary strings of length. And that avoid 0 0 k.  so  What did we do last time when we did the recursion?  for binary strings  you broke it up. Basically what you're going to do every time when you do recursions for binary strings you break it up and how do you break it up?  Start with 1 start with 0.  Any 00 avoiding and I stay long because you know, if it's too short then you can't do it but any 0-0 avoiding binary string must either start with one or start with z.  And so this is just like what we did before you're dividing it into two disjoint sets. So if I can count both sets then I just send those counts together. Okay. So how many start with one?  It's actually not going to be exactly half.  So you start with one and then what kind of binary string can follow?  Any that avoid 00?  right  know what the second character could be.  All that starts with yeah, we'll get to that. So there's a 10-1 spots and you can put any  And -1 bit string that avoid 00 right?  So how do you encode that?  The event - 1 that's the number of n -1 bit string that avoid 00.  So sorry to interrupt you. What were you going to say about zero?  Right. You cannot have zero zero starting so you have to have a one there.  So how many how many?  Positions are left over.  And mine is too and can I put any and -2 bit string that avoid 00 in there?  Why not?  That means we have the event is equal to B of M - 1 + 11 - 2. Is that look familiar?  Okay, stop.  Here's the recurrence.  Okay now.  Fibonacci numbers, I guess they're a little bit offset, right? They're not exactly Fibonacci numbers cuz Fibonacci numbers start with one one, but it's just it's just the sequence that sort of shifted back a little bit.  Okay, why do I put a pineapple on here?  Why am I wearing a pineapple shirt?  Huh?  You thought they were what?  french fries  Are pineapples anybody know?  No.  bingo  so the number of like spirals  the number of spirals in a pineapple  is a Fibonacci number generally not always but for the most part it is and that's and also like the number of leaves that has all these kind of things. You'll see the Fibonacci numbers come out in like plants a lot the number of Petals of a flower the number of  Pinecone spirals  How many?  now it's kind of like a crappy drawing of one, but maybe  I wonder if the number of  pineapples on my shirt  Is a Fibonacci number when that be cool?  Okay. Anyhow, let's move on.  another example  Let's say that a code word.  Like app at like maybe you have to make a password or something is an 10-digit. They say 10 digits string of the digits 0 through 9 and it has a even number of zeros. Okay. So here are some valid code words. I can have zero the could have no zeros and zeros that even number it have two that are in different places or it could all be all zeros like four zeros in a row how many of them are there?  Okay, so you guys are going to do this on your own?  or with your neighbor  and I just want to remind you. What's the first step?  Give me the name.  What do you guys want to call it?  see  Whatever you want.  You have some creative.  flexibility here  I think I I think I'm going to call it.  I'll think of something maybe CW.  You know, that's my favorite TV station.  Is that even a TV station anymore?  the CW  It's still right?  please get a warranty this problem is super tricky to Okay, so  you're getting stuck at a certain part then that's okay. We're going to will have time to finish it up.  Okay.  I'm going to help you guys start out. Okay, so I'm going to call it CW CW of n be the number.  code words  Okay now.  How do you want to split up that set any ideas?  Well, they're all Linked In.  counting the number of length and code words  Okay, if you do something like that.  You could do that, too.  For trying to count the ones that code words are defined to be even number of zeros.  All the ones that start with 0 and all the ones that don't start with zero, how about that?  How many of these ones are there how many don't start with zero this is the easy part.  There's CW.  Of n -1, but then how many different numbers could it start with?  Okay.  So how many start with a 0?  Okay, that's a good idea. But you may run into some problems cuz you may over count.  Right because whichever position you chose, that could be a zero in a different position.  Right, so you okay. You're onto something I think so you have to start with a zero. So let's say let's let  odd of n be the number of length  and strings  with odd number  Zero's a new set of things  Then if you start with zero, then it's just odd of and -1, right?  I mean, does this actually really help us? We're just kind of trading one problem for another.  But there might be a way that we can calculate odd in terms of code words.  Exactly so odd and plus code word end is equal to all strings.  And how many length and strings have 10 digits have digits 0 through 9.  Okay, so this is actually equal to 10 to the end of -1 - CW of end.  -1  Okay.  crazy example  So what's the final thing? We have CW of n?  is equal to 9 C W of N - 1  Plus  10 to the N - 1 - c w of n - 1  pretty crazy, right?  Are you can you can simplify this if you like to be?  10 to the N - 1 - 8 CW of N - 1  No, sorry + 8.  Frank  Pretty crazy. Okay, that's about it for today.  shop  have a nice long weekend. I'm not going to see you guys until Wednesday again, so.  There's going to be a homework and is going to be due next Wednesday. I'm not going to see you next Wednesday. There's going to be a little portion of it that has to do with Wednesday's lecture. Okay, so you can if you have two options one is to wait till Wednesday is lecture or two is to read in the book what the what the topic is. Okay going to be like a very easy question. Just want you to start getting used to these things.  I want to see what Wednesday.  But I said you could wait till Wednesday for the for the for the topic is going to be on Big O notation and stuff like that.  sandiego.edu "
