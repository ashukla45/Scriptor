Okay. Well, I will remind you that there's a homework that's due a week from today. That's that's something that I want you guys to do on your own you'll see that the problems aren't super involved.  So you should be able to do them. And one of the problems will be graded for correctness. And the other two will be greater for completeness. And then in the next few days, I'll post a group homework assignment that will be due a week from Saturday. That will will be a little bit more involved than the individual and that's going to be kind of the Rhythm that we're going to do two homework assignments per week. Except for there's a few weeks that you have off.  And then there's a discussion section tomorrow night and also one Friday morning.  alright, so  let's start off with an exercise away. I've got to hook up my Clicker.  got married.  Okay frequency is ba.  Okay, so you're at a ice cream parlor?  You can choose to have your ice cream in a bowl a cake cone or sugar cone.  Are 20 different flavors?  How many single scoop Creations are possible?  Is this a trick question?  60 good  what what rule do we use?  product rule  You have three options for the vessel and then 20 options for the flavor.  Okay, how about this one?  Now let's say out of all these things you can convert it into you can convert your single scoop of ice cream into a Sunday. Now Sunday is come with your choice of caramel or hot fudge whipped cream and Cherry are options how many deserts are possible now?  See see what you guys say here.  Okay. Now we have a little bit of difference here. Why don't you guys take a minute to talk it over with your neighbor? See if you guys can work this out get the right answer or at least come to a consensus consensus and then we can  Anybody want to make any comments?  So what what room are you guys using here?  summer roll  and product rule. We already we already figured out what this is 20.  x 3 right  Here's a good word to look at you can convert it. You don't have to convert it. Right so you can or you cannot so that kind of gives you the choice. So if you don't then you get 20 x 3 if you do then you have 20 x 3 any one of those things can be converted, right? And how many options do you have? So caramel or hot fudge? That's that's two options, right either or okay, so that's a to from this.  Okay, so whipped cream and Cherry are options. What does that mean? That means you can either have whipped cream or not have whipped cream. So whipped cream itself gives you two options.  And Sherry gives you also to options.  Any questions about that?  Okay, good question. So the question is wouldn't whipped cream and Cherry together be also an option that's taken care of here because you have this this to is  The options are whipped cream.  and no whipped cream  you can either or and then this option is for cherry.  and no cherry  Right and so you can get any of those combinations?  Any other questions or comments?  Anybody craving ice cream like I am  Yeah, me too.  Sorry about that.  Okay, let's talk about another way to count things. Okay, there's a way to do it using what I like to call.  bike templates Okay, so  You know, we're going to be seeing certain objects over and over again strings sets.  A sequence has these types of things. So these are things we're going to be counting most most of the time. Okay, so four letter strings. I'm talking about strings of the just the regular letters of the alphabet how many of them  I have one vowel and three consonants.  Can I see what you guys say here?  Okay.  Okay good. So what I want to do now is okay. We kind of have our answer. Is that what we think what I want to do now is tell you that one of these answers is correct and  The other ones are not correct.  Furthermore what I want to do is for the ones that are not correct. I want to tell you what they do count and this is a good exercise for you to do and it's actually one of the problems I gave you on the homework. I give you a number or a kind of expression and I want you to come up with some sort of set that it counts. Okay. So let's talk about part a  What could this possibly count? This one is actually incorrect. What could it possibly count?  the number  of what?  Okay, good two letter words.  That lets say start with consonant.  and end with vowel  that kind of makes sense. Okay. Good. Okay. How about be?  border yasso  four letter  words  with or let's say  come on now.  Okay, you don't want to do that.  start  with  3 continents  and with  vowel  I could have been started with bow and ends with three consonants also, right so it's kind of like the the arrangement of the letters is is given right. It's it's fixed. And so you have to kind of Follow That noticed that this one is just saying how many 4 letter strings have one vowel and three consonants. I'm not telling you where that vow is.  They said this one's actually correct.  Okay, how about this one? Anybody have any idea?  Okay good. So 4 letters.  starts  with three different  continents  Ends with vowel.  I kind of make sense.  We'll go over that in the next slide. But basically the idea is you see how C&B differ by a factor of 4.  So it basically be is saying four letter words that start with three consonants and end with a vowel but it could also be start with a vowel and end with three consonants or could be like consonant vowel consonant consonant and there's four different ways that you can arrange it. So that's where that factor for comes from.  Okay, how about party? Anybody have any idea of a question or  Okay party.  Aren't all about because 26 ^ 4 is all the four letter word. Okay good.  That all the four-letter words that are not all conference.  That's good. Another way to say that is.  At least one vowel.  We're going to see if we're going to see that again and whenever you see that that  Pair of words at least you're going to think about this you're going to think about the best way to count it is to subtract.  okay, so what do I mean by templates while you can kind of like right out the the template sort of like the  the arrangement of the vowels and consonants  and then count each one of those it turns out that they're all counted by the same number you just X 4K any questions about that?  Okay, let's move on.  so  we've done the sum rule.  Where does the thumb rule fail? Okay. So let's say that a is the set of all people who know Java and B is a set of people who all know see how many people know Java or C or both.  Okay good. None of the above.  Write the sum rules going to fail. Why is that?  Cake is good. You count the intersection twice. Exactly. Okay, so this is called inclusion exclusion.  So the way that we're going to do it is we're going to count the number of people who know Java and then count the number of people who know, so how do we get just the area inside of the two circles?  Subtract the intersection of the two things subtract the intersection and you get this nice formula here. This is called the principle of inclusion exclusion.  So just to bring it back to  the first day when we said the some rule if you remember we said the summer only works if the two sets are disjoint. What does it mean with another way of saying that the that two sets are disjoint?  There's white they don't share any elements or more specifically or more mathematically. Their intersection is empty, right or they're the the Cardinale the intersection 0 so you can see that the sum rule is just a special case of inclusion exclusion.  You guys can figure that out.  Okay, what if we had three sets?  Is there a way to count all of the all of the three sets the union of all the three sets?  Okay, so here's the idea.  You count all of a  and then you count all of me.  And then you count Olive C Casey of A + B + C here.  Then what do we need to do?  Subtract the intersection, right? So let's subtract off this football a b.  That's a intersect B.  subtract off this football B intersect C, right  And then subtract off what this football here.  a intersect C  Okay.  But what's missing?  This Dorito shape thing here.  How do you what do you call that Dorito in math?  Okay good and we have to add it back in right?  That's how you got it. Okay, so  that's why it's called inclusion-exclusion cuz you're including things and then you're excluding and then you're including and then you're excluding and in general.  you go back and forth like this until you're until you've  added back or subtracted off the inner.  Dorito  So in general this is what it looks like.  If you have an sets.  The first thing you do is add up all their all the sets all the cardinale's of every individual set you subtract off all the intersections of two you add on all the intersections of three you subtract off all the intersections of for add 5 subtract 6 and keep on going until you're done.  Let's do an exercise. What are you guys say?  How many lengths end binary strings are there that start with one and end with 0 0 K ready to go? Talk it over with your neighbors.  I'll give you kind of like a little hint here.  This will be  start with one  and this is  And 100 we're trying to find the union of these two sets. Okay, ready go.  Let me know if you have any trouble or have any questions where to start.  GameStop think about it in terms of counting  You know, what I should do is.  Think about it in terms of these three values right we can get all of these.  and then use the principle of inclusion exclusion Okay, so  Let's start with the red circle. How many are in the red circle?  Good 2 to the N minus 1.  How do I get that?  Any questions or comments or?  Yes, so how many n bit binary strings are there total?  To the end, right?  There are two to the end.  and  bit strengths  So how many of them start with one?  Will you can just put a one and then you can fill in the rest of the bits? However, you want in there and -1 bits left over.  Or you can think about it the other way take any.  And -1 bit string and if you put a 1 on the you know to put a one To the Left Bank to start Vanessa and bitstream that starts with one.  Okay, how many are in the green circle?  2 to the N - 2  same thing right? You just end with two zeros the start of the string can be any and -2 bit number.  How about in the middle?  2  to the end  minus  3  right because you start with one and then you have two zeros, then there's and -3 bits to fill in.  So you have like a start with one end with two zeros.  It and -3 bits to Philly.  So the answer here would be 2 to the N - 1 + 2 to the N - 2 - 2 to the N - 3  Okay, any other questions or comments?  What do you mean?  I guess.  I guess I should say.  With an greater than or equal to 3.  Yeah.  Or it's kind of like Union.  Right. It's like a certain certain.  Set contains elements that have one quality or another quality than that means it's the union of those two qualities.  Best movie as to simplify that I would leave it like that. It's it's actually like a lot more.  Meaningful, right? You kind of you see it and you can kind of see where each thing comes from.  paint and other questions  Are you guys ready for another exercise?  Okay, how many six digit strings for these are strings of the digits 0 through 9 and their strings are not integers so you can start with 0, okay.  They began with an even number or they end with zero or they only consist of digits less than 5.  So this is going to be a three-way one, right? But I'll just give you like a minute or two to get started and then we'll kind of finish it up together.  So one thing to do maybe before you get too deep into the problem a good thing to do in some of these cases is to label your SATs today. So you can call this one A B and C question.  That's a great question.  Is 0 considered even?  So we're going to consider all an even number is any number that can that is a multiple of 2 so, yes it is.  Okay. So once you once you label the sets now you can just plug it in exactly into the formula that we did a few slides ago.  So what is the cardinality of a?  5 x 10 to the 5th any questions about that  The five comes from you have five choices of even numbers 0 2 4 6 or 8.  Right, then the remaining five numbers can be any any digits. Right? And so you have 10 choices for each one of those positions to 10 to the 5th.  Okay, how about be?  10 to the 5th, right if you like it might even be nice to write it as 10 to the fifth times one, right? Because you have 10 choices for each of the first few and you have one choice for the last  good. How about sea?  5 today  Sixt  why is that because there are 5 digits that are less than 5 0 1 2 3 and 4 in so you have five choices for each position just use the product rule questions about those ones.  Okay. So now what do we have to do is figure out the cardinalities of the intersections.  a intersect B  Okay. So now intersection think about it as and Union is or intersection is and queso a intersect b means how many begin with a even number and end in 0?  Hey, so let's think about think about it in terms of what are the positions?  1 2 3 4 5 6  Okay, the first position has five choices.  Write the second position as 10 choices the third position 10 4th, 10 5th 10 and lasts. There's only one choice cuz sometimes it's nice when you're doing when you're doing things with strings or sequences nice to think about how many choices you have per position and then multiply all those together. Okay. So this is going to be 5 x 10 to the 4 x 1 any questions  Okay.  How about B intersects C?  Let's let's draw our thing again.  Okay. So what do we need to happen? We need that the first number is even and and we want all the numbers to be less than 5. So how many even numbers are less than 5?  3 case of the only have three options for the first  digit  and then what about for the second digit?  5  Oh, yeah, this is Aiden say, thank you.  I wrote something but then I didn't sorry about that sexy write 3 * 5.  I Spy  Is 5 * 5?  3 * 5 to the 5  Sorry about that. Then here will get to be intersex see.  Okay.  so  You need all the numbers to be less than 5.  And then the last number has to be zero so you get that.  5 to the 5 * 1  Okay, any questions about that?  Okay, am I done?  What am I forgetting?  The Dorito, right?  The Dorito is a intersect B intersect C.  where  All the numbers have to be less than 5.  And at the end of 0 and 1/2 to start with an even number.  so we get  3 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 1 and then just put them all together just like with the formula.  Okay girl. Good question.  If I see was actually only consist of Digit more than 5 then B intersect C would be empty, right?  Because be has to end in 0 and 0 is not more than five.  Sometimes these things can be empty.  Okay.  So inclusion-exclusion a lot of work to write down but it gets the job done.  Okay. So the next thing we're going to do is talk about just like we saw a few slides ago about subtracting.  One cardinality from another this is actually a special case of inclusion exclusion, but I kind of like to think about it as its own thing. Okay, so  Take a stab at this one. Just think about it for a minute. How many four digit strings of digits 0 through 9 have at least one zero.  Okay, good. Why is it so big?  Oh, wow. Okay. Good. You guys are paying attention. That's good.  B is correct  There's one more answer. That's correct.  Anybody know?  Okay, that's fine. Let's go through them just like we did before.  Okay. So the first one what is that Counting?  Okay, good. This is exactly.  10 actually write out 1  this is one of the most common mistakes I see.  Is this kind of thing where I asked you for at least one and then you go exactly one? Okay. So remember what I said before if you ever see at least think subtraction  so this one's good because it's 10 to the 4 is all links.  four strings  Right and and 9 to the 4 is all strings.  all length for Strings right length  four strings  without zero, right? So all the remaining strings are strings that have at least one zero that's kind of the idea. So 10 to the 4 - 9 to the 4K questions about that.  It's the way I kind of want you to think about these ones.  Okay.  can anybody  decode  this one here this make sense to anybody.  Think about it for a minute.  Okay, good. This one is actually also correct is just counting it in a different way.  It's counting all strings with.  1 0  plus two zeros  plus three zeros  plus four zeros  and this is using kind of the sum rule because each one of those sets is disjoint from the other right?  And this account encompasses all of the strings with at least 1 0 1 2 3 or 4 so you can you add them all up?  Okay, so, where is this 6 come from?  It's how many different ways those two zeros could be arranged positioned in the string.  It's going to be a combination so you can either have them both in the front. You could have them like this.  You could have them like this.  You can have them like this.  Have them like this.  And then also like this.  So there's six ways to position the zeros and we haven't really gotten that far yet. That's why I want you to use the the subtraction one.  Okay 9 cubed. That's what  Good. Yeah, maybe all four digit strings that start with zero or the end was 0 something like that.  Right and yet but with exactly one zero, right? All the other ones have to be different.  Okay, and then this one would be  This one sort of the misconception that I was talking about. This is like a common.  Miss steak  Right because he was kind of thinking about it as okay. Well, I need to figure out which position the zeros in and then I'll * 10 cubed because all the other digits can be whatever they want Frank I taking care of my zero everything else can be whatever they want any but this is not a good way to think about it cuz this is wrong.  Actually all a D and E are all wrong, but I just watched want to warn you about because it's going to come up again. Somebody's going to think to do that. And if you thinking of doing that change it in your mind and say oh yeah at least mean subtract.  was that  Yeah, okay. So the  the misconception is is this sort of reasoning you say something like  four positions  40 right you can either put in the first second third or fourth. Okay, once I pick the position for the zero, then I'm done. I have at least one zero now, let's fill in the other positions and there's 10 ways to fill in each one.  2  fill in other positions  This is the misconception.  You're you're basically you're over counting your counting things many many times.  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  Okay.  Alright, let's move on this kind of want to give you a picture of what we did. Right all the 4-Digit strains of 0 through 9. There are 10 to the four of those and here are all the 4-Digit strings of 1 through 9. There are nine to the four of those. Right? What we want is all the strains that have at least one zero and that's this space here.  Right. So this area is 10 to the 4-9 to the universe set and you subtract off part of it and your you get all this stuff for me.  I can't questions.  Okay, so whenever you see at least in the problem description that is a clue.  Count the entire set first, then count the complement of the set you're interested in.  subtract the two counts  So if I'm talking about this set again all the strings that have at least one zero What's the complement of all the strings that have at least one zero, it's all the strings that have no zeros.  I'll have you guys do this as an exercise. Okay, ready? Go?  You can talk with your neighbors raise your hand if you're kind of struggling with where to start.  And I'll come and help him see if we can.  Figure it out.  So you need to have at least two consecutive digits are the same.  When when I say consecutive digits, I mean consecutive positions.  Yes.  There are four digits.  right flank score  like the same number the first and the second position the same number, okay.  What do you mean the length is 3?  Oh, I see you're kind of considering that as one value.  I don't know how helpful that might be because  What if there are 3 digits in the in a row that are all the same?  Okay. So first step here figure out what is the complement of this statement of this of this set? We're trying to find.  the compliment  Is all four digit.  strings  that what  It don't have two consecutive digits, right the two don't have two consecutive same digits.  Let's count this. Okay. How many options do I have for positions, right?  How many options do I have for my first digit 10, right?  Then it says that I can't have two consecutive digits be the same. So does that limit the number of digits I can have for my second digit. So how many can I have for my second digit 9 now?  I know that the second and third digit can't be the same. So does that limit how many I need for the 3rd digit? So how many do I have there?  Who says 8  Who says nine?  Which one is it?  Got to be 9:30 dancing.  Got to be nine, right? It doesn't matter. If it's the same as the first digit. It doesn't care. It just has to be different than the second digit, right?  3rd and 4th digit need to be different to  still 9  right because if you're thinking about building the  The string digit by digit right? Then. The first digit could be anything you want. The second digit can't be the first digit. So there's nine choices the third digit can't be the second digit. So there's nine choices 4th is it can't be the third digit. So there's nice choices.  Okay, so  What's the answer to this exercise? It's 10 to the 4th. That's everything - 10 * 9 to the 4th.  I mean cute, sorry.  great questions about that  if you wanted to do like  Like the way where you use the sum rule.  You can do it that way, too.  You'd say like okay the first to match and the other two don't rent second to match.  Just that this way is a lot more. It's a lot faster, right? You don't have to go through all the things where we talked about 4 digits here. What if I what if I gave you a problem with a hundred digits?  I would just change this to a hundred and that's a 99. That's fine. But if you had to do it to some way he left the sum up.  A hundred different things. So just trying to save some work.  Okay, let's move on to.  a scheduling problem  Okay. So let's say that you have these four jobs arriving into a server J1 through J for the server starts each job right away splitting the resources among all the active one the different jobs take different amounts of time to finish but you don't know what how much how much time is takes how many possible finishing orders are there?  How many different ways can those jobs come in like maybe J2 comes in first then J1 then j4 then J-3 or something like that. How many different ways can that happen?  Okay good.  4 * 3 * 2 * 1  There's four options for whatever finishes first, then that thing finished so you can't pick it anymore. Right? So then there's three left over that finished second right now to jobs have finished. So there's two left over right times two, and then after three jobs have finished. There's only one left over to finish. It's going to be last.  Yeah, that's done. Okay good. So this is using the product rule just like we've done before this here is called a  Anybody know?  Permutation permutation is a rearrangement or an ordering of n distinct objects. So that each object appears exactly once that's exactly what the jobs were. So here are some examples.  Different ways that athletes could finish the race right? It's the same problem as the jobs different ways of seating in the class. So if I gave everybody here,  let's say let's say we filled up every single seat. If you guys changed around the seats those are different permutations where you can think about it is you can think about the number to the ordering to be like the first row second row third row in fourth row and every number every person here. You can think of yourself as a number based on maybe your birthday or The Ordering of your school IDs or whatever, right? What else different Arrangements of a deck of cards? So I gave you a problem about the deck of cards on your homework every time you shuffle a deck of cards.  You're putting them in a certain order, right? You can list them out. You think about him as like athletes finishing a race, right? There's a order to them.  Okay. So, how do you  how do you compute the number of permutations just use the product rule just like we did before you do end * N - 1 * N - 2 all the way down to one and this is call n factorial.  Okay, so he was kind of a weird convention.  Play say it again.  So that's a good that's a good point. But we permutations are only when there are distinct objects. So that wouldn't be as a permutation because the ones are the same.  So if you arraigned rearranged 1 2 and 3.  Then that would be a permutation.  We're going to we're going to get to that though. How how do you count those? That's different?  There's a there's a different way to to do those.  Any other questions?  Okay, why is zero factorial equal to one?  convention  by the formula is written in the book.  Okay good.  there's  only one way to arrange nothing.  You just don't do anything, right?  Good. Thank you for that.  Okay.  So those are permutations there's things called are permutations which are basically just  instead of rearranging the entire set your only rearranging a subset of them pay or a specific number of them. Okay. So for example  If I need to choose our rules out of a class of M student, let's say I need I wanted to choose a class president a class vice-president class.  Secretary of  the Treasury  and a class Secretary of Defense  then  those are four different rolls, right? And so let's say the class how many people are in the class 139  The night they would be 139 choices for the first roll 138 for the second hundred 3635 ways of passing out five cards to a group of five people out of a deck of 52, right? So you're ordering only five of the cards.  different ways of having first second third place in a runner's race of 10 athletes pay self  You know, you're you're only doing a small number of the entire set.  Okay. So how do we write it? We write it. Van are or is some people write it NPR?  and  I'm missing a thing here.  And what you do is you do and x + -1 all the way down our number of times.  So for example here.  We would have * 8 * 7.  my God  10 * 9 * 8 this would be 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48, right?  stop see how you have five factors and here you have three factors for the number of factors is r  So, where does this come from here?  Where is this fraction come from? How come that's the same as this product?  Exactly. This goes down to one right but in there somewhere is and minuses are right times and - r - 1 and so on right then you divide out by and minus. Our factorial is in - r x + - r - 1  Not want I ain't into all of this stuff cancels and you're just left with that.  candy idea  do some more exercises.  planning a trip  I'm planning a trip to all of these cities. How many ways can I do the trip if I visit every city exactly once  I didn't mean that every trip is going to visit all City. You can't have nothing right? I want to visit every city exactly once.  7 factorial  Right. It's a ordering of the city's it's the ordering of Seven Cities. Okay, good. All right. How about  what if I only visit five of the Cities?  Itsy right because this is our our permutation, right?  This is 5p 7.  Okay, what if I must start in New York and end in Seattle?  Okay good.  5 factorial  the way you think about it is just take New York and Seattle out of the picture. They're fixed now rearrange the rest of them.  Okay, what if I have to visit I start in New York and in Seattle, and now I have to visit Los Angeles immediately after I visit San Diego.  Okay, good for factorial. You can kind of think about San Diego and Los Angeles as sort of one city one unit. I know the people from La wouldn't like that and I know that people from San Diego wouldn't like me saying that either you think about them as one unit. Then you can rearrange the cities right take New York and Seattle out of the picture.  Just arrange those four cities.  Okay.  Street Lan in San Diego as a single stop, okay  I'm just going to skip through this realistically if we choose the order of the visiting cities based on distance. We wouldn't go to Los Angeles then to Minneapolis then to San Diego then to New York, right? We wouldn't jump all around. We probably would do it in a more orderly fashion. Okay. This is called The Traveling salesperson problem and it turns out to be one of the hardest problems to do if you're given a a map of distances. You can always find this in the corner of your Atlas, although nobody uses atlases anymore, right?  Anyhow when I was a kid when we go on road trips, we have these atlases and in the bottom corner of the Backpage you always had this big list. So if you could figure out how to find a trip through all the cities using the least number of distance, then you would be able to solve this problem. Okay, and this isn't just kind of a notoriously hard problem.  Just wanted to going to give it to you as a foreshadowing when we start doing grass.  Okay.  So next thing we're going to do, you know, you don't have too much about 15 minutes left with categories.  Okay, we sort of done this already in a way, but the idea here is we're going to take the whole set.  And we're going to divide it up into a bunch of categories and count each one of those categories.  And that's how we're going to count the entire set.  Okay.  so  The idea here is that if each if each category that I partition it into has the same number of objects as every other one, right? Then the total number of objects. / the size of each category is equal to the number of categories.  It kind of makes sense.  Maybe with an example.  cancel kind of like where  yeah, we'll see how it goes.  Okay, let's go back to ice cream.  Okay. So now this time I only get a cone. Okay, and I want to get a to scoop cone. How many flavors do I have a 10 different flavors? Okay. How many ways can I get a to scoop cone now? It's different if I have a vanilla and then a chocolate if I said that I have I have a chocolate and vanilla, right? I mean some of you would like to eat the vanilla first and then the chocolate after but other people would like it the other way around right? I mean just personal preference. Those are two different ice cream cones. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Right. So how many different ways can you do this?  Well for the top come up for the for the bottom scoop, there's and different ways right and for the top scoop.  Am I smart?  Write any questions about that?  Okay. Now what if I told you instead of a cone you get to have a cup or a bowl would I say a cup? Okay now in a cup or a bowl, you have two scoops right next to each other. Right? So vanilla chocolate is the same as chocolate vanilla. You can just turn your cup around the same thing.  so, how can we use our earlier answer to decide the number of Cups you can have  so we're going to do is count all of the objects and split them up into categories.  And then figure out what is the size of each category?  Okay.  So the objects are going to be the flavor Pairs and these are basically going to be the flavor pairs that you can have on a cone with chocolate vanilla is different than vanilla chocolate. This is something that's very easy to count. We've done it before. It's an * N - 1  Okay.  So the categories were going to group them in terms of the flavor pairs. Okay. So one group will be chocolate vanilla and vanilla chocolate. Another group will be chocolate strawberry strawberry chocolate. I don't know why anybody would mix strawberry and chocolate, but maybe that's your  so now  To figure out how many different cups you think about the number of categories, right? Cuz each category represents a flavor pair regardless of order. "
