    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Okay, good evening. Everyone or goodnight or whatever time we are in thank you all for coming.  so I have a little bit of technical difficulties cuz I forgot my  connector but I think I will be okay if I just use the  the overhead projector  Zach can you guys read that?  You can here we go.  Okay.  You wouldn't even know the difference, right?  Okay, so let's get started.  So I'll tell you a little bit about the course and then I'll tell you a little bit about.  The teaching staff that we have and then I'll go over the website and like the logistics and then we're going to do an activity and then we're going to learn.  A few accounting techniques, so that's what's going to happen today.  Okay. So what are we doing in this class? This is CSE 21.  Formulate and solve problems. This is basically every math class. Right? What we do describe data. This is going to be more focused on this class. This is a computer science class. So talk to a math class. But we're going to do is try to use mathematical notation terminology to describe computer science topics data algorithms those kind of things.  Okay, so why is this part of the computer science curriculum, you might be asking yourself that question.  Well, it turns out that computer science is a relatively new or field or as Matt is a very old field and some computer science borrows a lot of terminology from mathematics. It uses a lot of the same Concepts. Some people may even regard computer science as a subset of mathematics. Okay, so that's why we are using that's why we're taking this class.  It's on it turns out to be a very good tool for quantitative analysis right are there are programs good enough. How good are they how fast they run how efficient are they all this kind of stuff?  Okay, so I'm miles Jones. I'll be the instructor for this section. We have Andrew Kang. He'll be the instructor for the other section which meets on Tuesday Thursday. We're going to be coordinating our class which means that in the group homework. So you guys can work with people from his group and the classes will be very similar. I'll go over kind of the the calendar and how we're going to deal with some of the holidays that are coming up with this quarter.  Okay, we have some of our teaching staff hear you guys want to introduce yourselves?  close  Great. Thanks guys.  Okay.  I think this is a good opportunity to go through the website a little bit just to show you where to find everything. It's still kind of a little bit under construction, but will I think it's  It's almost ready to go.  so  Okay. So before we get into this, did you guys get a gradescope invite? Yes Piazza invite. Yes. Okay. So in the Piazza, you can find the link to the website and our there. Is there anybody here that's not enrolled in the class?  Okay. So for you guys you can just sign yourself up to Piazza and sign yourself up to gradescope. There's a I'll show you where it is. There's a code that you can use.  Okay. So here is all of our teaching staff. We're still putting in office hours here and there but you can see the office hours that you guys talked about already up there. Okay. So here's all the links that you can use and there's the gradescope code question.  It's just the same. Yeah.  Good question.  Okay.  so  yeah, so we're going to be communicating through Piazza.  There are a few rules that I want you to follow basically don't share any hints or Solutions on Piazza publicly. It's more for if you're confused about some Concepts if you if you want some clarity on the homework, if you want to clear up some of the you know, what is this? How is this wording? What does this wording mean this kind of thing or anything about the logistics of the class, then you can use Piazza publicly for that. Otherwise save all of that stuff for office hours.  Okay. So let's see. The lectures will be broadcasted. I'm just going to go through this pretty quickly. There's I'll go through the grating as we go along to the thing. They saw he was kind of what I wanted to get to the homework. You don't have to read this whole thing, but  basically, there's going to be two types of homework individual homework that you'll do on your own and a group home work that you'll do you could do on your own if you want or in a group of up to three people Okay, so  the individual homework will be  one of the questions will be graded for correctness. And the other things other questions will be graded for completeness. Okay is mostly to get you warmed up for the group homework and it's going to be it's going to be waited less than the group homework. So the your mistakes won't be as  As big as when you have a group home work. Okay, so and also some of the questions will be just graded for completeness and after saying that I want to remind you that you should look at the solutions because we're not going to be some of those problems. We won't be grading them won't give him you won't be giving you feedback for them. So go to the solutions to see if your answer was right.  Okay.  Homework solutions should be typed not handwritten. Okay, so you'll there will be points taken off if you hand if you  hand and a handwritten homework  Go through this. Okay participation. So there will be review quizzes that are due on Sundays. I'll get that first one out probably tomorrow.  And you can earn participation in lecture and discussion. Okay, so it's kind of like a complicated thing here, but let me just try to  Maybe I'll write it out in one of the slides. So you guys have we can all talk about it together will do that in a minute.  Okay, so we have a grade scale standards for evaluation regrades academic Integrity. Please don't discuss your homework problems with people that are not in your group unless you're in an office hour setting with one of the Tas or one of the instructors good that's kind of the place to do open discussion with everybody when you're on your own just work with in your groups.  Okay, so textbook.  We're mainly going to be using rosin the same book we use for 20. We kind of beer a little off from the textbook here and there but we generally stay on the topics. I'll show you the calendar in a minute and you can see which sections will be doing.  Okay, so  discussion sections  so  a few things about discussion sections. Okay. So the first thing is that we're not going to have Monday as a discussion section and if your  If you are signed up for that as your discussion section and you can't make any of the others, then you can come talk to me and we can figure out maybe some sort of accommodations. I think that you'll be okay because they'll be a lot of other help that you can get. But if you're if you're having a problem with that then come talk to me and we can figure something out. Okay, so that means that the discussion sections are Thursday and Friday. It was just brought to our attention that the Thursday 1 is  Kind of not a very good time and place for the other section. So that that room might change we're going to look at that. But anyhow, you can go to either discussion section and earn participation credit their stop.  No, you don't need to do anything online.  Oh, but you do need to register your clicker.  Okay, so register your clicker.  Sorry, I should have said that.  Here at clicker registration. Don't do it on Triton that I'm not going to look at Triton it so just do it on there and make sure you type it incorrectly question.  What if how do you know which?  Oh, I it doesn't matter you can attend any discussion.  Yeah.  And I'll go over the participation points in a minute.  Let me just go through the calendar.  Okay, so here's the calendar. So the first homework is going to be do next Wednesday the individual homework. Okay, I'll put that out soon. And the review quizzes will be due on Sunday group home works will be dude generally on Saturday.  And so this class is going to be the blue columns.  We do have coordinated exams with the other class are going to be on Tuesday nights at 8 and they're going to be weeks.  I don't know whatever week that is.  29th of January and the 19th of February  so there's that and then  I don't know why I put a bunch of section numbers on here that you guys can look at and read through.  Got any questions about that?  Alright, let's go back to the slides.  Okay.  Let's get our clickers out.  I I got to open my clicker thing.  All right.  Oh, no.  Okay from current slide.  Okay.  so  oh, this is not the frequency.  I need to set the frequency.  Frequency is ba.  Okay, like ba baracus.  Have you guys ever seen The A-Team?  No.  Okay. So, what about you guys did you take cst20?  here at UCSD  Okay, good. So  Oh, yeah, I should write the frequency on here.  ba  okay good. So I guess they don't they don't do math 1580 more. This course is really kind of like the natural next course for you. If you didn't take cst20 then I'm just hoping that you took some sort of discrete math course that taught you about logic sets proofs functions.  more proofs  a lot of proofs  induction. Thank you.  my favorite topic if you guys have used iclickers before  okay good. So those of you who put e-may B I should tell you how to use it.  Be quick or be here cuz there's those are the only two.  options  Okay, here we go.  Okay, good. I just wanted to kind of see most of you guys have done it. Okay, that's enough there.  We're going to be using iclickers in this class. They'll be part of your participation grade will go over participation after we do the iclicker stuff.  Okay.  Where are you from?  Okay, just as I suspected.  There's more International students than people outside of, California.  Now that's generally the case.  I don't know. What years what is that other planet?  Okay, here's your first quiz.  And this one we're going to grade.  for correctness  HB, Virginia  Okay last clicker question.  How confident are you with induction?  Okay, so  For the A's and B's good for the Seas. I'm hoping to maybe make it.  less scary and more of a tool instead of like a  a scary weapon  And then for the Deez what's induction, this is a very important proof strategy that you need to know for this class. It's going to come in.  Pretty early and stay with us for the whole time. We're going to be doing induction over and over and over again. So  Maybe this first week and part of the part of the next week. We won't do it. So maybe that'll be a good opportunity for you to teach it to yourself. Talk to me talk to the tutors. See if you can.  Figure it out.  It's not.  I don't know. It's  it's kind of hard but it makes sense after you've done several examples.  Kinda, okay.  Okay good.  Alright, let me just give myself.  I just want to give myself.  One more slide so we can put in all the stuff about the participation.  Okay, cuz that's going to be important and  kind of confusing  okay, so participation it's kind of confusing but  It's important. So  Okay.  each lecture  is worth  2 points  each discussion section  one point  the review quiz  Is worth three points?  Okay.  So here's where it gets weird.  Okay. Well, let's just see so that means that you can come to to lecture. So that's four points and one discussion section. So that's five points plus the review quiz, that's eight points total that you could earn.  per week  You can learn.  up to eight points  per week  But we're going to cap it off at 4 per week. Okay, so if you go over for then you've done your participation for that week.  a website that  Okay, let's back. Let's make it up to 3. So let me get myself a note.  note to self  change  website  Okay.  Okay, so that means that you can maximum four points per week that I'll record now you need to so that means you can get 40 points for through the whole quarter cuz there's 10 weeks. Okay. I'm going to give you the full 5% participation if you do 30 points, so 30 points.  or more  will equal full 5%  and your on your final grade?  29 Points will be 4%  28  will be 3% And so on 27.  Call now.  2%  26 1% and 25 and below  0%  Okay, so you can you can earn all your points just by doing the review quizzes if you want.  Do you have to come to the lecture you're enrolled in to get the pointer to go to the other way you can go to the other lecture, but we're going to be doing the same topics.  So you can't get both of those. If you go to the same topic that make sense.  And you can see what topics were going to do on the website.  Okay any other questions?  Doesn't that mean deposit?  yeah, so  in terms of participation points uses going to have to earn them back up on the review quiz.  Crap, so that's just going to be how we deal with that how we going to deal with lining them up?  the  Okay, so  Andrews class is at 6:30 to 8. Okay, and then to the exams are right after his class. Okay, so during his class they'll probably be like an hour or so of review. He's not going to do like new material during his class. So  We'll have to see.  To see if maybe I can get a bigger class for him.  Let me let me work on that. But basically that means that on exam days. He's not going to do any new material and there's two exams and two holidays. So we're going to decline back up.  question  sure.  Yeah, I understand that. Maybe some of you haven't gotten clickers yet, but you can earn back those points on the review quiz.  Okay.  I'll send out a note on Piazza to when I have the review quiz ready for you guys. So, you know where to find it.  Okay, let's keep on going.  so  where he talked about these review quizzes and midterms final exam.  I don't know if it's good or bad. But if I'm on the Saturday after the last day of class.  That good.  Like would like a textbook in all that stuff. Does that mean we don't act?  Okay. I saw the text book thing.  You guys have all gotten these links, right? So  I don't I don't care how you obtain the textbook there is this online version that you can get that they sent you a link for and you can opt in.  Is not how it works. Okay, good. You can do that and there's like a bunch of online material for you to you can just use the hardcover book or find some pdf version of it. Anyways fine. We're not going to be assigning homework questions out of the textbook anyway, so even if you get like a a previous Edition  Then that should be okay. The only thing is that maybe the dissection numbers don't line up.  And what link? I think that one cost money. I think it's like $50. Is that the website did anybody buy it?  Yeah, so I I told the lady that I wanted everybody to be opted out as a to start and if you want it then you opt-in just because that happened last quarter right in CSE 20 and everybody was like yeah, nobody wants the book and so everybody had to opt out but then they didn't send the email in time. So people were like it was not a good a good thing. So if you want it, it's great. I'm telling you is great, but I'm not going to it's not going to be a mandatory thing.  That kind of makes sense.  What did I give you a link?  Yeah, that's from the bookstore.  It's just so that if you want it you can have it.  I don't think it's a waste cuz it is a good resource.  the book  Can I have that?  Always at the optional book that was optional book.  Which is also good mainly for like the algorithm stuff that will do.  Okay. What time is it 8:30?  Okay, this is all stuff. You can find on the on the website. We've done enough of this stuff.  alright register your iclicker on Google forms and  make sure you  Right. You're right clicker number.  And write PID and use all capitals.  I had a problem with that last quarter with somebody that didn't use all capitals and then had to like find his thing and it was kind of a mess.  Okay. How do you Excel?  So the assigned textbook sections will be in the calendar. You can read those to prepare for class engage in class. We're going to stop a lot of the times two to discuss material. I like it when you talk to your neighbors, especially when there's kind of a confusing question.  Go over the wrong choices to that's part of being a mathematician. You kind of have to figure out why it's wrong that will help you figure out how to get to the right answer right and it's also good for when you check your work.  Reinforced after class summarize start on your homework right away. The individual homework is supposed to prepare you for the group homework. So I want you to take it seriously.  Okay, so Excel.  So with Integrity, I hope everybody knows what that means. Please don't cheat only hand in your work or the work from your group. Don't look for answers online. If you do then I'll consider that a violation and I don't want to have to report anybody. So please be careful and be mindful of the where you're getting your information from.  And what you're turning and what kind of work you're turning in?  Okay. So this is kind of a summary of what we're going to do counting. That's what we're going to start with when you start a little bit with that today asymptotic notation recurrence relations algorithms iterative and recursive probability enumeration and data representation and graphs. We're going to build the problem-solving skills and learn how to present the idea is clearly and vigorously.  Okay, so  the great so we're going to do an activity.  It's kind of counting but it's also kind of algorithmic. Okay. So I want you to do is everybody take out a piece of paper or half sheet of paper or whatever you have. We're going to attempt to count the number of students in the class and we're going to do it algorithmically.  Okay. So what I want you to do is  write your name and  month  day date write your name and your birthday month day. You don't have to put the year just month day.  Okay.  And write someone and some two underneath someone right one and underneath some to also write one. Okay?  Is this sort of out-of-focus now?  Okay, someone and some to these are going to change as we go through the process. Okay. I'll tell you what the process is in a minute.  I got everybody got one.  Okay you this whole class is going to be the computer? Okay, and this is the algorithm that we're going to do.  Okay.  So if you have a piece of paper place is kind of like a while a while loop for you personally individually.  But I'm starting here if you have a piece of paper.  Find somebody else with a piece of paper. Okay at this point everybody has paper so everybody's going to participate.  If nobody is available, wait for the next round, that'll be fine. Okay, so the person would the earlier birthday. This is what you're going to do, right? You're going to put the stack of your neighbors papers underneath your stack is going to put one stack on top of the other.  I guess before you do that you want to add the to someone's together. So this first time you're just going to add one plus one. Okay, cuz you're someone is going to be one of your neighbors. Someone is going to be one bank. So you just going to put two after the first round.  okay, and then you're going to add one to your some to  okay, then you put your neighbor stack underneath your stack.  Okay, you guys got it.  What's up?  So the person with the earlier birthday takes the neighbors paper stack and puts it under his stack. And so your neighbor doesn't have any more papers and you're just going to have to sit out for the rest of the round.  Taste of your birthday is December 31st. You're only going to play around 1. I'm sorry about that. I'm going to give you some questions to think about and we can we can go like that.  No, you just you can do it in your head, but just just like right underneath right you so you start with one and then you have to and then maybe 4 and then maybe eight right as you go.  Okay, and so  Let me know when you guys are done around 1.  This is always such a mess. I love it.  Okay, I'll be done around 1.  Okay, how many people still have paper?  Okay, good around half of the class. Okay, so then do it again. Now you're going to take your stack add the some someone's together. So it's going to be two plus two now.  At some point you're going to have to get out of your chair. Okay, so just keep on going. I'm not going to call around anymore. Just keep on going until either you have.  I told you I don't have any papers left. How about that? I told only one person has any papers left.  That's fine. Doesn't matter. Yeah doesn't matter you can have different numbers of stacks in the papers. It doesn't matter.  How's it going?  in my jacket for men  Good.  Okay, as you guys are doing you guys got got the hang of it. Now if you're sitting there without paper, I want you to think about these questions, okay?  And if you still have paper I want you to find somebody else will paper.  You might have to get up.  What are people with birthdays?  like if two people have the  Oh.  Go by the year.  Oh, yeah or something to go by your first name or something? Yeah.  Hey, the stacks are getting big now.  Okay.  Is it just down to you to now?  Don't worry so much about keeping them in order. Just make sure that your your papers on top.  And that the sums go together.  You need a calculator.  All right, go by the first letter of your name.  Wait, they have the same birthday and they're both name is Nick.  Today's your birthday. Today's her birthday.  Wow.  What about last name?  Wow, that's amazing.  What do you have if you still have some too?  I need a calculator neck.  I have one more pile coming your way.  badger  That's crazy.  I don't know.  The number is greater than mine. That's fine. Don't worry about it.  Duck Song  Unbelievable  Okay.  excellent  Here, I'll take them.  Thank you, Nick. Give Nick and everybody else and the other neck around of a pause. Thank you.  Okay, so let's think about these questions. They're going to come back when we start talking about algorithms. I like them because they are really good when we were talking about Loop invariant things that don't change. Okay. So what do you expect will happen Okay. Well that's sort of an open-ended question. What I expected what happened would be that the last two people would have the same birthday and the same name.  I have no idea just playing. Okay. So how many papers will the will the last person have?  All of them, right what will be who will be the last person standing?  person with the earliest birthday  What will be the value of someone?  ocean  number of people, right?  And it was a hundred and thirty-nine.  Does that make sense?  That's a pretty good. I think we did pretty good, right?  What will be the value of some 2?  Right. So hit the number of times that the number of times that that last person did an exchange right? Does anybody have an estimation of what that would be?  half of  half of what do you mean someone owe someone so like around a hundred and moving around 70?  Yeah.  I know it's going to get a phone number. I don't know. Okay.  Okay, good. It's going to be around log base 2 of someone we didn't do it perfectly but we kind of know it was.  Approximately, you know, we did that week we had every time we did a round half of the class got to sit out right and only half of that remained right to keep on having that. So what's the log base 2 of 139?  It's somewhere in between 7 and 8, right?  This is some to was exactly 8 so, you know, so it's not going to be an exact number, but it's going to be around the log questions about that.  We'll talk more about in detail about how that works later on a pay-per-view pay-per-view. Will they be in sorted order?  Is it possible for them to be sorted?  If you're really really lucky right, but no it's not going to be sorted.  What else can we say about it? It's the the earliest birthday will be on top, right?  On top and what about on the bottom the latest birthday, right?  Not necessarily, right? Okay. So really the only thing that we can say is at the earliest birthday will be on top why I do that.  Okay, any other questions or comments?  could be  could be but it also could be on the bottom, right?  Yeah, but there's nothing you can say like for sure, right you could probably could make sort of probably a probability distribution of where it could be. Right but we can't say for sure but we can say for sure is that the earliest birthday will always be on the top in fact.  That's a loop invariant for this algorithm. Every every time anybody held a stack of papers. The earliest birthday of that papers was on top and so this is going to be kind of how we prove that algorithms work you say at every point. This thing is true. So at the end one person all the papers and the early birthday will be on top there for that person has the earliest birthday night so you can kind of think about how to  prove algorithms this way just kind of wanted to do an activity just to get a sense of how many people are going to be here and  This is sort of in the realm of counting very special way to count.  So do you guys think that this was faster or slower than if I went to the room and went one two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine and so on.  Write this is going to scale a lot better. Right if the this class was twice as big or three times as big right or we did it in the whole entire school. I'd much rather do this than count one by one. That's a good point. That's another thing we're going to talk about. How do these kind of algorithm scale?  When they get bigger, are they more efficient or not? Okay any other questions or comments?  So some to is every time you make a an interaction you add one to it.  queso  so the  so everybody's keeping the sum to as they go right? It's basically just a keeping track of how many interactions you had.  Yeah.  No, he had 8 he had eight interactions. It took eight rounds for him to  yeah.  Yeah.  exactly  is log base 2  Because every time every round the the size of the class that still has papers is cut in half.  No, it's log base 2 of 139.  Are you mean if if 10 people got together at once and all figured it out that way? Yeah, I guess so.  But we're computer scientist a wheel of log base 2, right?  And that's kind of how it worked. Okay.  Okay, so  the last question  Yes, sounds like the same like what he was saying to you just did like every round you had three people and they all kind of did that thing at once  And you added one for every interaction of three people.  Because that means that the class would be divided into three at every iteration.  Okay.  So let's get into more or counting compound interest. This is a topic that I did as my  as my thesis when I was a PhD student, so it's something that I really loved and I and I like to try to use different concepts to teach it and last last spring when I taught this class last I just gotten back from Yucatan in Mexico, and I was just very  Charmed and  excited about the the culture of the Ancient Maya and their calendars and Mathematics. So I'm going to discounting lesson will be in terms of Mayan numbers. Okay?  so  in their calendar  they had  13 numbers and 20 names? Okay. So every day is a combination of those two. Thanks. Okay, so you could be one day could be a 10 dog and another day could be eight earthquake. Okay, so you're thinking about think about the days being named in Paris?  so  where's my mouse?  shoot  Okay, I'll just do that.  Text to each day has a number and a name. There's 13 numbers and 20 names. How many different days can you have before the cycle starts again?  So today your birthday, Nick and Nick.  January 7th is to son and I have this link down here. If you want to look it up. It's got like some some sort of like astrological meaning. For example, my birthday is 7 read and it says that it's a very meaningful day a day of Triumph. Those who are born on this day are very lucky. Very true.  Calm also true intelligent. Well course, although sometimes can be moody. And that's also true. So this one really kind of really spoke to me.  I love I love these little symbols and everything. So, okay. So what do you guys say? Okay good.  C260 we don't need like a bunch of lessons to teach this right? This is something that you learn. This is something that you use everyday, right? You have two numbers and all the different combinations of those two numbers put together, you multiply them to figure out how many different combinations there are this simple rule actually has a name it's called the product rule and it's basically saying that the cardinality of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities. So A cross B is going to be the set of all ordered pairs. Will you have a name and a  a number and symbol the name and number and the name and so to figure out the number you multiply  Okay, so this is how to count pairs of objects.  Count the number of choices for the first and the second this will only work if they don't depend on each other.  Okay, so  this don't have to take notes on this. I just thought it was cool cool picture. So I put it up there. It's basically the you have the 20 20 names and the 13 numbers. That's those two little wheels. And that big wheel is the 365 days of the year until they all kind of like rotate and gear all together and it will do 52 years of revolut Revolution until it gets back to its starting place.  But we're not going to go into that. Just thought it was kind of a cool fact.  Okay.  so  there's another calendar.  And this is the one that in 2012. Do you guys remember like the whole hubbub about like the Mayan calendar was going to be no told everybody that the end of the world was coming or something like that in 2012. So this is this calendar Okay, so  The idea is that you have a kin.  Uniel a tune cartoon and Foxy has one day a union is 2010. So 20 days. Okay, but soon is 18 Yuan. All cartoon is 22 and a baktun is 20 cup chicken. So how many days are in one box tune?  You might need to break out the calculator seer.  How did I do the young?  Okay good.  Saudi  cartoon, I mean 144000. How did you get that? You multiply them all together, right? So this is like using the product rule but for many things right you don't have to do just the Cartesian product of two things. This can be the Cartesian product of many things. That's kind of the idea.  Okay.  So today January 7th. This is how they would say it. It's 8:10 to you and 620 cartoon and 13 Buck 2. How many days have elapsed since the mythical Maya creation date.  So notice that this here is just a ordered quintuplet, right? It's just a list of numbers and each one of those combinations of 5 numbers will represent a different day. Okay, so to figure out  How many different ones there are?  What are we trying to figure out how many days have elapsed since the mythical Maya creation date you do 8 plus?  2 * 20 + 6 * 20 * 18 + 0 * 20 * 18 * 20 + 13 * 20 * 18 * 20 * 20 and you get something around 3100 BC.  whatever that means  Okay, so this just to kind of give you a sense this 13 baktun when it was 13 0 0 0 0 0 that was 2012.  Pretty cool, huh?  Okay, how are you doing?  Okay, so  Here's an even simpler question. Don't think about it too hard. There's two calendars. One of them has 20 named symbols. And the other one has 19 month symbols. How many symbols total are there?  Okay good.  Okay. This is an even simpler rule that we don't really have to go over in-depth. This is called.  the sum rule  Okay, where's that thing some rule for any two disjoint sets the the cardinality of their Union is the sum of the car now, please.  We're not going to dwell on this.  Pick one set has 21 set has 19 their disjoint. So you just add them all together.  Okay, when they're not disjoint then something else happens. We'll talk about that on Wednesday. So this is basically the account numbers with a given property. We're actually going to use this a lot in this class not necessarily to count two different sets. But when we want to count one big set, what we'll do is we'll divide it into two sets and count each one of those it turns out that sometimes doing that is easier than just counting the whole thing.  Okay, here's some exercises.  So if you ever played we in 2005 then or do they still look like this?  Okay. So let's say you're putting together your character and there's 12 hairstyles and hair colors how many different characters are possible but save this is the only options that you get.  What do we use good product rule that you guys are good?  I know these are kind of easy. We're going to get to harder ones in a minute.  Let's skip that one.  Let's get to the binary strings. Okay.  Length and binary strings. So this is going to be a  integral Topic in this class. We're going to talk about binary strings a lot because there's so much fun to count.  Show Atlanta and binary string is just a string of zeros and ones of length, and how many length and binary strings are there?  Take it to the end.  Great.  okay, so if you're if you're kind of wondering why there's to the end or if you kind of just want to see  or want to know how to think about it.  One good way to do it is to figure out if there's a pattern and this is this is going to be a good technique for harder problems that you have if you're going to say, I don't know how to count this thing in general. So they let me count it on smaller examples and see if I can get a pattern. Okay, so we're going to let bs&b the number of length and binary strings. Okay. So what is BS of 0?  How many 0 length binary strings are there?  Who says zero who says one?  Okay good.  Okay, the answer is one.  Why is it 1?  What is the string of length 0?  Empty string. Okay good. So let's just write the set that it corresponds to wait. How do we do it Lambda, right?  Okay, so one, okay, how many binary strings of length 1 are there?  2 + 0 + 1  and how many of length two are there?  For you can just write them out.  And of 3/8 can write them out of exercise. I answer then you could see this one 248 and get the pattern and get to the to the end.  position  Okay, very good. That was going to be my next question is how do you count the number of links and binary strings and you can use that what you're really doing is doing the product rule over and over and over again, right?  So this will be right 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 because you have two options for each position.  and if you like  Get rid of that thing you like you can think about the the length and binary strings are a Cartesian product of the set 0 1.  Cartesian product with a lid with itself and times  Right, and I guess you kind of do an abuse of notation, right? Because we you generally write binary strings as as words right as string. Where is the Cartesian product you write him as like, you know, you can maybe get a zero from this guy a one from that guy has zero from that guy and maybe a zero from that guy right but then you can just put that into a string queso.  You see a lot of that in when we do these counting things is that certain types of objects are counted the same way. And so you kind of kind of think about them as the same object in a sentence.  Okay.  any questions  So that's where you get to the end. There's one other way to do it and that's by using the sum rule.  This is sort of a different way to get around at it and it's not directly using the sum rule by adding two things together. It's what I was saying before you take the whole set and you split it into two parts and then you count each one of those parts.  Okay. So how we going to split the set of all binary strings of length n so split.  the set set  Thanks.  and binary strings  into  Strings  that start  with one and strings  start with 0  Okay. This is a nice way to split it up. It has the properties of you guys. Remember equivalence relations. It's got this kind of property where you Union those two parts together. You get the whole set and every single string follows in one or the other. Okay. So if I can count both of those I had this time together I get the whole thing.  Okay, so the set.  of length  and binary strings  this set has cardinality what?  B what did I call it BS on that was kind of a weird Choice Awards  to the set of all length and binary strings is BS event. What about all the strings that start with one? How many are there?  We have that one and then what follows?  some binary string of length and -1  right  so strings that start with one you have vs of + -1 and strings that start with 0 you have BS of + -1.  Now we put them all together.  And we get that BS of n is equal to.  BS of N - 1 + b s of n - 1  Okay. Now we have something called a recurrence relation and we're going to talk about how to solve these things probably starting week too. But this is also a really good way to count things is to figure out a recurrence relation and then solve the recurrence.  questions about that  Okay good.  I have it up there in the recurrence relation you need I just I guess I put in you need.  You need an initial value, right? You kind of need like a bass case to figure out how to build it up.  I guess that's it.  Okay, so I'm on Wednesday. We're going to start talking about different counting techniques and see you then.
