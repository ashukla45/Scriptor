    "Full Transcript": "listening to a podcast  Alright, so let's get started.  All right class good evening.  All right. What are we doing today? More grass problems. Mainly how did we apply that algorithm we talked about on different problems. And then we're going to look at some more problems. And how do we build and design algorithms to solve those ones?  Okay, you guys remember?  One of my favorite movies while I really prefer the first Die Hard. I think that one's the best.  Might be the best Christmas movie.  Yeah.  What about Home Alone Now?  diehards better  What about Die Hard 2?  Not as good.  You Know It Die Hard 2 it always like what surprises me when those marine guys turn up turn out to be bad guys it always was like  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very haunting cast Arie spoiler alert for the movie.  You live there.  Really? What is the actual Tower called?  Wow, that's cool.  I'm going to have to go visit it. Can you let go Inn in my have a tour?  Really?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm going to LA this weekend. So maybe I'll try to go up there. This one takes place in New York.  Yeah, I think it was filmed in like 1994 or maybe even earlier than that. Anyhow, the problem.  tartaglia's pouring problem  okay, so we didn't really get so far in this but we did talk a little bit about  We talked about this week. We don't have to do the clicker for this one cuz we already did it. It's basically.  Is there a path from 800 to 440?  So what we did was each birthday, we made each configuration into a different vertex. And there's The Edge from one vertex to a to the other. If you could you could pour you can make it in one pore right? We saw the other day that each pores reversible. So this graph is going to have arrows going in both directions.  okay, so now  is there a path of I need to open my clicker thing?  Yes, right.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  So you have an idea right?  Why is this clear thing always take so long?  Okay, wait. So what are you saying? You have five in the first one?  5 + year 3 and year zero and there  and then what?  You feel the middle one.  Okay, so they're not all reversible good.  Yeah, okay. Yes.  all this was just  just one possible configuration.  Okay, so the edges are directed right? They're not necessarily River. Okay, that's fine.  Are algorithms still work? Don't worry.  How many vertices do you suppose it will have?  infinitely many  4 * 6 * 9 equals 216 where's the for six and nine come from for the first cupcake have 0 1 2 or 3 oz right. This second, can have six different things.  24  16 or none of the above  Okay good.  So actually all of these are correct.  Wait, what how can they all be? Correct?  Write the vertices exist, but there might not be a path that goes to them. Right? Let's think about what each one can kind of represent.  So certainly infinitely many you can think about well, the the level of liquid is like a continuous quantity. So you could have any continuous value Frank, so there's infinitely many.  This one where a lot of people chose be this comes from the fact that well, there's four different if if you're only think about integer level ounces in each cup, there's four different choices for house filled. The first cup is 6 and 9 you get 216 different combinations.  But there are some constraints that we didn't think about yet, which is the total amount of water has to be equal to 8, right.  which means that the  well  I guess what you could think about is that the middle cup between the Middle cup in the Big Cup, right?  you can have  Let's think about it with the middle cup in the small cup.  Okay, so there are six choices here times for choices here, right? And then whatever you don't use you put into the big cup, so that would give you 24.  So really there are 24 different ways you can fill up the cups so that they all add up to 8 now. I'll show you one more kind of constraint that we can use to lower this number down to 16.  Okay, so  The total must be eight. Okay good. So here are all the 24 different Arrangements that add up to eight but some of them are impossible to have. Okay. Remember what app or a valid Torres you either need to empty 1 cup into another or you need to fill one cup of all the way right? So  all the valid pours have to have at least one cup that's filled or at least one cup. That's empty.  So let's look at this one. For example.  All the cups are like hat like a part of the way filled, right? There's no way that you could get that with illegal poor cuz I kind of make sense.  Okay, so there are eight of them that are like this.  Okay, so here are all the eight values eight configurations where all the cups are partially filled.  Getting that leaves 16 and as you're going to see all 16 are reachable from your starting position.  It may not be may not be obvious at first glance, but we'll see that it is.  Okay, so you can arrange these vertices in whatever way you like. I'm going to arrange them like this. It's kind of like more of a  kind of putting them in some sort of a ray. These are the all the 16.  and  Like I said before.  As we're going to we're going to basically use this graph search algorithm to figure out which configurations are reachable.  But all we are given at first are just a vertices where do the edges go will you can actually use the algorithm to build the edges, right?  Or you can just put in all the edges to start right? It's not hard to to figure out how many different way how many different pores you can do started.  Remember our Graph Search algorithm. We initialize X to be empty have to be the starting vertex and you to be everything else you pick somebody in F and then you basically explore all their neighbors or at least look at all their neighbors and put them all into a half and then when you're done you take it out.  Okay.  Let's look at the first step here. This guy is in F.  right  who are its neighbors? Well, I could either poor or all five.  ounces into the middle cup  or I could pour 3 oz into the small cup.  So I find those two and then the next thing I do is I put  800 into X  and I put these two guys into f  The next thing you do is you pick a vertex in F. We can just pick one at random.  Let's say we pick 3 5 0.  What are the neighbors of 350?  Well, you could pour all the five back into the three that will bring you back to ex.  Rank are so poor all the five back yet into the 8th, but X has already been explored. So you just don't consider it anymore. Right? Cuz it's already been considered. You already looked at all its neighbors. Okay, so whatever its other neighbors  053 right  So that's by pouring the big cup into the little cup. How about if I pour the middle cup into the little cup?  323 Wright  I didn't want to do that yet. Okay good. So are there any others?  Yeah, that's it. Okay. So now this guy becomes  ex also  and these ones become.  f  Get the idea.  any questions  You can see that this systematically goes through every single possible vertex that you can reach.  All right.  Let's go through a few more. So I guess I went for that one and you can keep on building this up and I don't I guess I don't.  draw the  The reversible edges but that's fine. We're just trying to find out how to get there. Okay, so  As I built this thing, I found out that every single vertex is reachable. And if I run the algorithm I can figure out the  the path  Okay, I think it goes. Okay 800  350  32362. Oh  602  152  1 4 3  144 so that would be how many pores  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 4  Is that the is that the least number of pores? I don't know. I just wanted to find out if it was possible and it is possible and this gives it to us can anybody do it in fewer pores?  So you do that right and then you do what?  so it would be  530 okay.  So b233.  Okay.  Okay, so that would be 251.  so that would be  701  so 710  the last one  so then it would be  4  13 and then 4 for 3  440 sorry  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  It works too, though.  Can you guys can think about that?  Okay, let's move on.  To all the configurations on a graph can be reached as we have found a way to get to all them further. We can't to get to any new configurations. These are the 16 possible configurations and we found a way to divide the liquid in half. All right, let's move on to another topic. Okay, so this is going to be the topic of connectedness.  Okay, and undirected graphs, there's this concept of connectedness a connected graph or connected vertices. Okay. So two vertices u and v are connected if there's a path from you to be  so this and then I didn't.  Here we go. Next flight.  An undirected graph G is called connected if for any pair of vertices VW, there's a path from V to W. Okay. So the left graph is connected every pair of vertices. There's a path the right graph is not connected. Why well, I can find two vertices such that there's not a path between them, right? There's no path from F to J. For example, therefore it's not connected.  Always considered unconnected if there's at least one vertex that has a degree.  This graph is connected.  That's connected. Yes tribute.  Yes.  Okay, so  An undirected graph is connected for any pair of vertices BW. There's a pass for VW. What does it mean for a graph to be disconnected and disconnected is just the negation of connected. So what I'm asking here  I wasn't asking for here is the negation of that connected statement.  For any for any pair or for all pairs of vertices VW there is a path from V to w.  How do I write that in?  propositional Logic for all  V4 all W there exists  a path  Such that.  Do we write such that or we just wrote a parentheses such that P is a path.  From V to W. How do you negate that thing?  Okay good.  Is that what sea is?  There is an ordered pair of vertices VW with no path from V to w.  Good, right, cuz remember the negation it like whips all those can.  What do you call those quantifiers?  Write the negation is that there exists be there exists W such that for all paths.  Pee is not a path.  B2w that's basically what this is saying.  Okay, good now.  each graph  each undirected graph if it's not connected then there are more than one connected component. What is a connected component? It's a maximal connected piece of the grass. Okay. So how many connected components are there here?  Three good. I just want you to notice. This is a connected piece of the grass, right? This is a connected subgraph. Why is this not a connected component?  Right. It's got to be maximal. So it's got to be like as far as you can go out while still remaining connected case of the three connected components are this.  This and then write any questions about that.  That's called a connected subgraph.  Yeah.  And a connected component is a connected subgraph like a maximal connected subgraph, right so you can't get any bigger.  Okay.  Okay, so really important here this word connected only use it for undirected graphs.  Okay, don't use it for for directed graphs. We have other words for that. There's like two different kind of connected type things for directed graphs. Okay. The first one is something called strongly connected. Okay. So this is for directed graphs. There's two different.  terms  so strongly connected means that for every pair of vertices. There's a path from one to the other and back.  So is this strongly connected?  I know, right?  Why not? Well, for example, there's no path from a to H.  now we're not going going to  Get into it so much. This is like more of a topic that you'll explore in 101 but you can you can break up a directed graph into its strongly connected components and what are those it's kind of the same idea that we had for connected components. It's like the biggest maximal subgraph. That's all strongly connected. So for example,  ABC is a strongly connected component.  e f  D&G on this is kind of a boring graph. So you have like a bunch of like singly strongly connected components.  questions about that  What's up, Fort? Here's another example. So directed grass can be broken up into pieces where each piece is strongly connected as large as possible. He's such a piece of the grass is called a strongly connected component.  Okay, good. All right.  weakly connected  Is this graph weakly connected case? There's also a term that only is applied to directed graphs and the way you taught you say if something is weakly connected is you erase all of the arrow points. And if and then you've turned it into a undirected graph. Is that underline under Vector graph connected?  So good. This one is  Weekly connect. Yes.  Did they have to go to Beckley to age? Do you have to be a path?  Oh, yeah. Yeah, so that's why it's kind of tricky with the directed graphs because you know, I have to have to be a directed path from  And you can make this graph strongly connected right? You just add a few edges in maybe like here.  Here now. Is it strongly connected?  so  you can like play around with what that means any questions.  All right.  Let's move on to the next problem the Seven Bridges of konigsberg.  the question  Okay. The statement. There is a Old Town of kernig's bird, which I think is in.  Russia or Germany?  It's like some it's in Europe.  Okay.  Okay. So this is kind of like a map of the city and those green footballs are bridges. Okay, the question that or the kind of activity people like to do was try to have a walk around town where you cross every bridge exactly once is it possible?  And those blue things are rivers.  Okay, so we have some nose we have some yeses.  Okay, so let's give it a try and see like if it works or if it doesn't work.  Okay, here we go. Let's start.  Where should I start maybe in the island? We will start an island.  Okay, I'll go over this bridge.  And go over that one.  Come back around and I'll go over that bridge and I'll go over that bridge.  And I'll come around here.  over that bridge  average  no problem easy, right?  Know that there's a dam there.  the river just  Write this River doesn't keep on going. No. I'm just playing the the real problem. You have to think about these Rivers kind of go on forever. Okay?  maybe they like meat and this one kind of goes on and  if you do one  do you still have to come back across the rest of the bridges?  Oh, I see what you're saying. Let's do that.  Maybe you can like travel across the world and circumnavigate the globe and then get back on the other side somehow.  Okay, let's just make another way to say it is that we have barriers.  Let's they say there's Town walls or something. Okay, that's fine.  You can't cross those Town walls. Can you do it? Yes or no. So this is actually where a lot of people trace back the birthplace of graph Theory comes from this question because  In order to solve this problem.  You can turn it into a graph and the edges and the vertices of the graph are enough information to kind of state the problem and they have really have all the information that that you need for the problem. Okay. So what is the graph look like? Well, we're going to have for landmasses, right 1 2 3 and 4 and the land masses are connected together if there's a bridge that connects them. Okay, so there's one Bridge here.  One Bridge here one Bridge there and then there's two bridges for each of these. So this is not a simple graph multigraph cuz there's some parallel edges.  So that was more pretty version.  So the idea here is that the exact location of those islands and land masses are not really important. The only thing that's important is are those land masses connected or are they not or how many times are they connected? Right and so you can kind of strip away a lot of the the map and the locations of everything and just strip it down. Kind of like the bear graph is enough to solve the problem.  Okay. Now we kind of turn it into a graph Theory problem, which says is there a path that goes through every vert to me every Edge except exactly once but that's exactly what they the people of kernig's berg were trying to do.  Okay, let's look at a few other examples.  I guess I didn't say.  Yeah, we'll say it now.  Which one of these figures can you draw without lifting your pencil off the paper and without retracing any edge of the figure you can see that this is the same problem right? It's kind of going through every Edge exactly once without.  Retracing right this type of path is called.  an oil Aryan path  because Oiler Leonardo boiler.  He was the one who?  tried to solve this Bridges problem  Okay, so DD works, right? You draw the big triangle and then you draw the little triangle that how you guys did it. Did you guys start with a little triangle first?  Doesn't matter.  Okay, how about all these others? Let's try be.  Do the hoops.  Do the X and then do the square up crap? I mean dang. Okay, that doesn't work. How about just ask where do the square and then?  Okay, if that doesn't work, okay, how about the this weird one? This certainly has one do the square.  And then go like this and do that. You didn't see that one coming. And then I think I'm already screwed. Okay, so I haven't shown you that these ones it's an even show you that it's impossible for a B&C write in order to do that will one way to do that would be show you every single possible path and show you that none of them have the requirement that it goes through every Edge that would take a long time because there's a lot of different unique path. So what essentially did was classify graphs in terms of do they have oil area pass or not, and he used a very simple feature of the graph that you could you could look at.  And if it had this feature then it was then a hot oil area path if it doesn't have the features and it doesn't write and stuff in order in doing this. He basically simplifies the problem into having a Euler path into does this graph has to have this very simple property and it will go over with that is in a minute.  Okay. So an oil Ariens path is a path for each Edge occurs exactly once and oil Ariens circuit is a oil Ariens path that starts and ends at the same vertex.  So does this guy have a oil area path?  Let's see. Okay. I'll go up go around might get that out of the way.  Okay, let's get this site out of the way.  right  I think I already messed up.  Okay, go up go around go down.  Go like this right now. Here we go, go around.  Go up and down.  All right. Let's try a different one. How about this one go up and over and down and they're there their they're okay. This one's good. So just has an Euler circuit because I started and ended at the same point.  Okay.  What will happen will figure out what's going on with this one later. Okay, so that questions the algorithmic questions are the existence does a given graph container or Larry and Pat in the path will if it if it contains one, what is that turns out they're great algorithms for these butt.  They're sort of like the oil Ariens has evil brother.  the hamiltonian path  hamiltonian path is notorious in the reason is because it's really hard to do. It turns out to be in order to find a hamiltonian path that turns out to be one of these problems called NP complete which means that there are no known polynomial time algorithm to solve it. Okay hamiltonian path is a vertex at Chris Biggs Ackley was so instead of each each vertex.  Does the given graph contain one is the existence problem and then find one if it is does these problems turn out to be NP complete?  Okay now.  Actually is not known how to determine in any reasonable amount of time. All the best algorithms that are known work in exponential time. We talked about like the time analysis.  So here's an opportunity. You can earn $1000000 if you can give an algorithm that finds a hamiltonian tour if one exists in an arbitrary graph on N vertices that takes big of an K time for some constant k  Get to work you do it, okay.  If you do it if you find this.  If you can do it, then you have proven that P is equal to NP. I know maybe you know what that means. Maybe you don't know what that means. But this is like a really big question in computer science. So it would be really good. If you know, it would be really interesting if you were able to prove it. I don't know how good or bad it would be really good for.  Like routing companies like UPS and FedEx and stuff because the problem of finding good pads to route your packages and stuff is a NP complete problem and they usually rely on really good approximation algorithms.  Probably be really bad for security companies who rely on the factoring of really large numbers being a hard problem to do like your credit card companies and like  encryption kind of things though a lot of those require factoring large Prime, which is a  Notoriously hard problem to do but if he was equal to NP, then you could do it fast and you can probably break a lot of codes.  stop  if you do it, you could earn a $1000000 by telling the world or  I didn't say that I didn't say that. I was going to say or come talk to me and we can we can arrange a  No, we can we can write a paper together. I can I can coach you on.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no. No. No, that's unethical.  Kind of funny how such a small problem can have so much weight in the world in in like today is Computing world.  Okay, so  our strategy  is basically to solve this problem as puzzle. Okay, we're going to use these algorithmic.  Concepts to solve puzzles  and the way you do that is you take the you take whatever model you have. Whatever puzzle you have and you model it as a graph and then you turn the the problem specification into a graph question kind of like what we did with tartaglia's pouring problem.  Okay, then you can use graph algorithms to solve the puzzle. So here's one example.  Given collection of short DNA strings find the shortest possible DNA string that includes them all. Okay. So there's a lot of different ways you can put this into a graph problem.  A successful solution to this was a big step in the Genome Project and in biology, Sol.  Let's look at an example.  I say that I have all these collections of small short strings that are each 3.  What do you call those?  base pairs  Okay, find the shortest possible DNA string that includes them all as substrings one way to do. This is to make the vertex set.  Is the set of all those?  Snippets then there's an edge set the actors Edge from one to the other if the last two letters matches the first two letters of the next one.  So for example, there is a pat. There's an edge from atg to TGC.  Right, and there's a Edge from AGG to ggt and so on. Okay. So now what is the problem into?  We want to get a path that goes through all.  vertices  Thanks. So that's a hamiltonian path.  Which is a hard problem, but for this part, this is example, it's pretty easy. Right? Just kind of follow your nose.  Here we go, then then there and then hop over so that it might not be so simple. So.  We can maybe look at it a different way.  And build a graph in a different way instead of having the vertices be these little Snippets. How can we build a graph so that the edges were these little Snippets?  Okay. So the idea here is that the vertices are going to be pairs?  of base pairs  in the edge set is going to be there is an edge.  from  one pair  to another  if  I guess I could say there's a there's an edge from  X Y 2 y z f x y z is in the set  let's look at what this looks like.  I noticed now 80 is connected to TG because atg is in the sack Gigi is connected turned it into.  finding an oil Aryan path, right because now the edges  Are the elements of ass?  Okay.  So and remember an oil area path is easier to find than a hamiltonian path in general so little bit better.  Okay questions about that.  Okay, let's look at  yeah, this just talks about what we talked about before. Okay, let's let's move on to another algorithmic question another puzzle that maybe we can use graph Theory.  Imagine a scenario where you need to get 3L into the correct position to escape or when I'd like unlock some sort of video game or something. Okay, so  How many different possible positions of the three levers or are there?  Is it leaver or lever?  Lever, okay. Sorry.  Okay, good. They can either each for each one that could either be off or on and so there's two choices for each livre. I mean lover and then there's three to the third any questions about that.  Counting  Okay now.  What you would like to do is go through all possible all of those eight possible combinations and you want to do it using the fewest lever movements. Hey, so they all start in the down position or in the off position how many lever movements are necessary in order to get through all eight possible configurations?  Exactly the hypercube.  cibercuba  Okay, good. Oh did I not start the thing?  The quicker I wanted to see what you guys say.  What is D 24?  You can do it in 24. You might be able to do it in fewer though.  No, it's like you're trying to do it in the best-case. What's the fewest number of switches?  You can do in order to go through all of the different configurations.  Okay. So how do we change this into a graph problem?  Each configuration is a vertex and there's an edge from one configuration to another if you can get there by only moving one leather lever either up or down right you can think about the lovers as like bits right one for on 04 off.  So this graph is going to have eight vertices each of them a binary string and the strings are going to be connected in that way. Now if you remember that's exactly how we described the hypercube.  now  so they can protect set is the configurations Edge set is an undirected edge between configuration V and configuration W. If they did different exactly one lever, I'm making it on directions to because all of those things are reversible, right?  Okay. So now it turns into a question of is there a hamiltonian path in a hypercube and the answer is  is there a hamiltonian path right because essentially you want to get through all configurations without repeating any right? Is that possible to do?  Well, then the answer to that question is the same as the answer to the question of is there a hamiltonian path in this?  Graph, can I draw a path that goes through every single vertex exactly once without repeating anything?  Let's just see kind of let's just see what happens here. All right, maybe I can go up here.  And then over here.  And I which way should I go down?  down  and then over  up and over  I got to go. So there's one.  there's not  there's not a unique one, right? There's many that you could do but this gives you a scenario a sequence to do it. So how many edges did I Traverse?  Seven right? So there's seven it only requires 7 lever changes.  any questions  Yes.  all hypercubes have hamiltonian paths  So what if there were four switches 546 is there a way to try all to The Impossible combinations with only two of the N -1 switch flips. Like you said the answer is yes another way that state this is does each hypercube. Always have a hamiltonian path.  So this is also something called a gray code. Have you guys heard of these?  A gray code is a way to basically list out all of the binary strings in such a way so that each consecutive binary string differs and only one bit. Why is this useful?  Well, maybe it's a really fast way to generate them. All right if you put them in.  What do you call that increasing order right then you have to do like a bunch of like carrying the one every time you you reach.  What am I trying to say?  Rite Aid  Yeah, I have to do some roll over right eye always think about it as like your odometer in your car right when you reach 9 9 9 9 9 all those numbers have to change to get to the one right. Whereas you fuse a great code you can list them all out and change only one.  at each step  Yeah.  I went to three.  That's a good question. So this takes let's say it takes one operation to get from one to the next for everything right. Where is that would take up to log in?  You mean like this?  You mean in this particular?  It's a kind of magic.  Sure.  Yeah, I think I think you know, there's there's a many different ways to do it right? There's there's not just one ordering but I think there is a a rule here that you can follow.  Yeah.  I think it's kind of like go to the  like switch on the  tell the position with the least.  I could just switching on the right most maybe switch on the rightmost position as possible.  right, will that work in our  example  we have 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0.  This would be 100.  101  Oh, no. Yeah. I mess this up.  What is it?  This is not 100. This is 0-1-1. And this is 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 and 1 1 0.  So then you start here and you flip the the rightmost bit. So you go up to here and then you flip the rightmost bit. So you go to here and then you flip  Yeah, maybe that's not the thing. Anyhow, I'll think about it.  Okay.  So hypercube grafcu and has a hamiltonian path for any and greater than or equal to one. So it's possible to make a great code of binary strings many length.  What is the Graco dough this is it oh I even have slides for it.  This is how you do it. Okay, so you can kind of Build It Up inductive Lee.  Okay, so  think about the first one as right writing out all of the one bit strings. That's easy. You just write it out zero to one right now to build a hypercube inductively. What you do is you copy the  you copy the hypercube over and you connect all the corresponding vertices, right?  So I make two copies of this thing one of them with a leading zero and the other one with the leading one. Okay, then you connect them.  and the  the path now is going to go and let me get a different color.  Going to go here here here.  Now do it again copy this thing over twice. So I have a blue one and I have a red one.  And do this do this path first in the blue one crossover and then do it reverse in the red one.  Okay, so it goes here here here crossover and then do it in reverse.  Triton and that's like a systematic way of always doing it.  Okay, so let's get back to back on track to finding or Larry and pads.  You have a graph it's undirected. It's connected and has n vertices. The first goal is to determine if it has a oil Aryan path or tour second goal. If it does then find that tour.  Okay, so the key observation in grass that have oil area paths.  Is that Envy is an intermediate vertex in the path? What do we know has to happen with me?  Okay, so we're right it's in degree has two equal without degree. And if we're talking about an undirected graph that just means it needs to have even number of edges right because if it comes in on this one.  Comes out on that one comes back in on. This one comes back comes back out on that one.  So it needs to enter as many times as it leaves.  Okay, turn oil Ariens path contains all edges. So half of the edges are used to enter behalf of the edges are used to leave. Okay. So what that means is that every intermediate vert vertex has to have an even number of edges.  5th degree of V must be even  Okay, good now.  What is that mean about the starting vertex in the ending vertex?  Okay, so they could both be odd, right?  Going to be a path not a circuit, right? If all the vertices are even then that means you've entered and left every vertex. So that means that the whole thing is going to be a circuit.  Sure.  Okay, so the inner core layer in path any intermediate vertex has to have an even degree. And so then there's two cases if there's a circuit which means that all the vertices have even degree and you can start anywhere or it's a path that's not a circuit in which case the starting and ending vertices have to both have odd degree.  All the other degree all the other vertices have to have degree even degree.  Okay, so  this is a great observation and it is very helpful.  But really we've only argued One Direction Right, we've argued that if the graph has these property, excuse me, if I have oily Aryan path, then then the graph must have these properties. What's the converse of that statement?  Okay good.  So this is kind of a trick question cuz they're all kind of the converse of the statement.  Sort of dressed up in different ways, but we're going to look at mainly is.  Oh, sorry to see is not the converse contrapositive.  Okay, but let's go with B because it's kind of like the most direct Converse. So it says if G has at most two odd degree vertices than G has an alloy Larry and Pat not remember that a statement and its Converse do not necessarily have to hold the same truth values. Right? All we've really argued is that if I have a path then it has to offer a degree vertices. If not necessarily true that if it has two ought to be vertices that must have a path turns out that it is true, which is good because that gives us a indicator for when it has oil area Pat. All you have to do is Count out all the degrees of all the vertices.  Okay, so is the converse always true?  Answer. Yes, and the way we're going to prove it is by building an algorithm and showing that the algorithm will will build this oil Ariens path given the  given those constraints on the graph  Okay, so  here's the idea of the algorithm.  Does this graph have an oil area path?  Yes, right.  Because what are the degrees of the vertices we have 2 2 2 3 3 2 2 2.  So it has two vertices of degree 3 and all the other ones are even degree. So which vertex must I start at?  four or five  Let's say we start at 4.  Okay now.  Which way should I go?  I should go to either two or three what if I go to 5.  You kind of left the one two and three behind right? So what what is that property that that that edge has that makes it so that we shouldn't go down it.  It's a bridge right? So this bird this Edge 4/5 is a bridge.  A bridge is an edge it which if removed would cause the graph to be disconnected. So which edges on this graph are bridges?  a good day  D&E are both Bridges me questions about that.  Take them away. The graph becomes disconnected C is not a bridge you take it away. The graph is still connected.  Okay good.  Basically, the algorithm is like this.  You have to visit every Edge that's not a bridge before you visit that bridge right, you're kind of like taking out all of the things that are possibly reachable before you go into the other.  portion of the graph  so we have to visit every Edge on one side of the bridge before we crossed because there's no coming back.  Okay, so this is called Fleury's algorithm.  And the idea is well, this is sort of like a high-level description check that g has at most two odd degree vertices easy enough.  Start at the vertex V if it's an odd degree if possible.  So while there are still edges in G. The thing you're going to do is if there is more than one Edge.  Go down the edge. That's not a bridge right now. There's only one Edge that means that at that edge has to be a bridge and so you're kind of saving the bridges until the end.  Okay, what path do we get if we use Fleury's algorithm here. Well, like you guys said we go to 2 and we kind of take away that edge from the graph. It's not there anymore you go to one you go to 3. Okay. So now when I'm at 3  The Edge 3 to 4 is a bridge right? That's the only Edge that's possible so I have to take it.  Okay back to 4 same with 4 to 5 is now as a bridge.  Five I have more than one to choose from neither of them are bridges. But so you can just go down either one.  And we did it.  Okay. Now let's go back to the original problem.  Is this possible?  Well, we have degrees 353 + 3.  Can't be possible. Right? So now this is a way that we can show.  Definitively that there's no solution for it without having without going through all the possible combinations which would take forever. So all we have to do was just count the vertices.  Okay. How about these guys?  Well, he has 4 degree 3 vertices get rid of that one has 4/5 degree vertices get rid of that one. She has for 3\u00b0 vertices to get rid of that one. And then he all the degree vertices are even so that one should be fine. And in fact, that one should have a circuit as a as the oil Arian tour it just start and end at the same vertex is the only way to do it right you got to start and end of the same for a text.  got any questions  Okay.  so  wheat wrap  the first goal determine whether a graph has an oral Arian tour or path or whatever.  It has a path. If and only if it has at most two odd degree vertices second goal. If it does have a path find it and the way to do that is to use Fleury's algorithm and this is sort of the  The way to remember Fleury's algorithm. Don't burn your Bridges until they're the last thing that you can that you need to burn.  Okay. Now I want to kind of go through this little table of  What happens with each degree? Okay. Now if the number of odd degree vertices is 0 that means that it's all even degrees vertices, right all even degrees.  And we showed that that it is a possible certainly and does it have a pack? Yes. It does. It's actually a circuit always going to be a circuit. I think about it the starting vertex. Will you start there and then you leave right? But then you have to come back till like pair up that  that ad going out.  Okay, is it possible for a graph to have one degree vertex and all the rest even?  Know why not?  What is it?  Change what?  I'm talking about is the graph even possible. Is it even possible to draw that graph?  Each Edge you add two more degrees.  Write the sum of all the degrees is an even number right because remember that.  sum of all the degrees  Is equal to x e?  V&V that means that if you have an odd degree vertex have to be paired up with another odd degree vertex, so that the sum is even if that's not even possible as okay if it has two odd degree vertices than that has a path graph as possible has a path. It's not a circuit always not going to be a surrogate.  Okay, any odd degree number of odd odd number audibly edges? No not possible. Any even number of Audrey edges the graph as possible, but you can't get a boy Larry and Pat.  questions  It's the same as or Larry and Pat tour and a path same thing.  Okay.  What else should we do today?  Maybe call it a day. What are you guys say?  Yeah.  I think so.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
