    "Full Transcript": "podcast  Alright, okay. Let's get started.  All right. Today we're going to start probability. But before we do that, I want to finish up the  the encoding by lexicographic ordering. Okay, so let me just remind everybody.  What our goal was?  It was two.  Encode a certain set of objects. Now. There's a bunch of different kinds of ways to encode them. But to get the theoretically optimal encoding you and code them with log base 2 of the number of objects. So  For this example or going to be in coding all its density binary strings and there's n choose K of them. So the theoretically optimal encoding would be the ceiling of log base 2 of n choose k  I ain't we got to take ceiling here because  write this is the number of bits the minimum number of bits. You need to uniquely Define this many right and choose K many objects by binary strings.  Okay, so the idea is what we're just going to be napping them to the integers 1 through whatever this number is.  And you store the position as the encoding and decoding you just look for where it is. So the way that we're going to order them if I lexicographic ordering.  and the idea is  just think that you have some dictionary of all the objects there in your  Dictionary somewhere so you just fine where it is. You look at what number it is. That's how you encode it. If you want to decode a number you find where that number is and you look for the string.  And so last time we I had you write down all of the lengths five binary strings with exactly three ones and here they are in lexicographic ordering.  and if you recall what we had done was notice this certain property that I have is that  all the all the ones that start with zero come before all the ones that start with what how many of them start with 0 will that is  just the same as counting all length for  bit strings  with two ones  so then we can use this and then we can do it recursively queso if it starts with 0 becomes before that value * 331  and if it starts with one, then it comes after that value. Okay, so this is the idea.  is this  Okay, so did anybody do this as an exercise?  All right, let's do it together.  Okay, so here's the idea.  How many lengths 9 binary strings have three ones?  923 which is does anybody know?  56  80  No, no, it's 4 * 3 which is 12 * 784.  right  84. Okay good. So we're going to store each string in the positions.  positions  0 through 83  Okay. So this one's this string here starts with 0. What does that mean? It means it comes before a certain value, right? So how many of these string start with 0 and how many of them start with one?  so  8 choose 3  start with 0  what's 8 choose 3?  56  Okay, so then let's call this string. The string is equal to S. Then the encoding of ass is got to be less than  56k  I just feel kind of like look at it bit by bit.  Ass is less than 56 and actually well.  Actually what we can get out of this is that Kia of 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9 2 3 is the same as he of 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0.  8 3  I ain't so it's kind of like we're doing this recursively and now if we can get that then we can get that.  Let's go. Let's go one step further and kind of see where this is going.  Now we have this guy starts with one, right?  So in ordering all of the eight bit strings with three ones.  this one comes after 7 choose 3  so  pa-100 10100  8 3  Is greater than or equal to 723 which is what?  35  okay, and in fact  now you take off that one zero zero one zero one zero zero and now we have a 7 bit string with two ones.  This is going to be equal to or sorry.  I didn't mean to do that one. Sorry.  Kiev 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 the original string with 8 3 is going to be equal to 35 Plus.  He loved and then you take off that one zero zero one zero one zero zero.  Okay, and you keep on doing this over and over again, basically whenever you see a one you get another term that you had on and at the end.  I forgot what this one was. So you just going to have to do it as an exercise.  I know it's a pain in the butt to do this before computer. It's pretty easy, right? You have your base cases the other base case.  If your string has only one bit then you know exactly what it is. Right and so just returned zero just returned the first position. Otherwise look at the first bit, right if the other should be a b  if B1 is zero then in code B2 through bien.  with  with the updated numbers there, right?  Otherwise else be one is equal to one and you add on and -1 shoes K plus the recursive call on B2 through bien and you update those two numbers.  shop  That's how you encode. This is how you decode and it's basically just going backwards. You're giving it a number right a position.  We also have to get with it and in KY you need to know what you are and coding what type of object your encoding. So if n is equal to K.  And that just means the output stream has to be all one's right because if n is K that means it's a n bit string with n ones. So it's just a bunch of ones.  That's the base case otherwise.  Now you just look at the position if the position is before that and -1 choose k then you add a zero.  To the front of it and if it's after.  Then you had one right? This is where P greater than equal to C.  Okay, so we did it as tradition requires. I do the engineer's victory dance.  The theoretical lower bound we got to it and this encoding algorithm is optimal, which means that you couldn't have done it with fewer.  positions or fewer bits  Okay any questions?  Alright, let's move on to probability.  Okay.  Probability is a branch of mathematics it it has some intersection with discrete math, which is kind of what we're going to talk about. Now. It also has some intersection with real analysis, which is  Basically the study of kind of continuous functions differentiable functions this kind of thing.  basically functions over the real numbers  and it has its own terminology. Now one thing to know about this terminology. It's just the same. It's just different words for the same things that we've already talked about most of the stuff that we learn in 20, okay.  Whenever I say sample space all I really mean is asset. That's it. So sample space means set.  Probability distribution it sounds scary. But all it is is a function. Okay. It's basically a function that assigns probabilities two outcomes K. What is the outcome?  element  sample space  Is just the same as set outcome is the same as element. Okay. So what is a probability distribution?  It's a function.  pee that sends the sample space to the interval 0 1  you guys remember that notation for functions?  But it has a very important constraint.  Is that the sum of all the probabilities you sum up all the probabilities of all the outcomes you have to equal one? Okay, so it's a function that has this property.  questions  Okay now.  Where's my?  I got to open the clicker thing. I didn't do that yet.  Start new session.  Okay, let's compare flipping a Fair coin and a biased coin. So a Fair coin means that there's a equal probability that it comes head or tails. They so the probability is 50% either way a biased coin would be something that is not fair. So maybe heads comes up twice as often as Tails or some other scenario.  A fair car flipping a Fair coin is biased going to have this different sample spaces or have the same sample space but different probability distributions or have the same sample space and same probability distributions.  What are you guys say?  Okay, good same sample space different probability distributions. And now let me write out what they are just so you can see what you know, what kind of objects were working with.  Okay, so the sample space for for both of these?  is the set that contains heads and tails or if you want to say it's containing the event where the  coin ends up on heads and the outdoor the outcome where that coin ends up on Tails, right? But it will just abbreviate them with h&t.  Okay. So what is the probability distribution? Okay, so the Fair coin?  It has P of H is equal to 0.5.  A&P of T is equal to 0.5 is a function that takes the sample space to the interval 0 1 and if you add up all of the  probabilities of all the outcomes you get exactly one.  Okay, so, how about a bias going?  then the probability  Of heads, I don't know what some value so I don't know Q some some.  value in between 0 and 1  so what's the probability of tails?  1 - Q right exactly cuz you have to they have to add up to 1.  Okay good.  Okay, another useful.  vocab word is event  Event just means subset. Like I said all the probability vocabulary and just stuff you already know but in a different word  Okay, and we can say we can talk about the probability of an event. That's just the sum of all the probabilities of all the outcomes in that event.  Any questions about that?  So another kind of thing is that now with this notation I can say the probability of the sample space is what one right?  Okay, let's talk about some of these probability distributions. There's there are some special ones. One of them is called the uniform distribution basically assigns the probability 1 / n to every element of s where s has an element's so for example for the Fair coin that was a uniform distribution because it assigned the same probability to every single outcome.  Okay.  when flipping a c a Fair coin successfully three times  What can you say about it? The sample space is HT the empty set is not an event. The event that it is probably less than 1 the uniform distribution of science probability of 1/8 to each outcome. None of the above.  What do you guys say?  Not going to jump on the bandwagon here. Let's talk about why these ones are wrong. So the sample space is not HT anymore.  Any questions about that?  Are we flip it three times? So in fact this here is the sample space.  Enter this one's wrong because the probability of that.  Event, which is the entire space has to be equal to one.  The empty set is not an event. That's wrong.  The empty set is always an event of every sample space. Why is that?  Because why?  It says it's because of that means subset and remember that the empty set is a subset of all sets.  And the and the probability of the empty set is always zero should have wrote that on the previous slide.  Probability of s is always one probability of empty set is always zero.  Okay. So this is the right one the uniform distribution of science probability of 1/8 to each outcome. You have a 1 1/8 chance of getting any one of these eight outcomes any questions about that.  Okay, so this is a uniform distribution.  now  what if we changed the sample space to be?  Orton kind of change the focus. It's the same type of problem, but we're changing the focus so that the sample space now is the number of heads that show up after you flip a coin three times.  okay, so the sample space now is  0 heads one head two heads three heads.  Okay. Now is this still a uniform distribution or is it going to assign different probabilities to two different outcomes?  Okay good.  Couldn't eat all the answers day today.  D Goode  The probability of zero heads is 1 out of 8.  Probability of 3 heads is also 1 out of 8, right.  And then the probability of one and two heads are each 3 out of 8 any questions about that.  I don't know. I just noticed it now.  Okay good. So now this is not a uniform distribution.  Okay, uniform distributions are great though. If you know that you have a uniform distribution then finding probabilities is really easy and it all I guess it's easy to painting on the problem. Right? Basically, it reduces to the problem of counting. So  if you start with a uniform Distribution on a set s then the probability of an event e-cig just  the size of e e / the size of ass  sup  What's the probability of getting exactly K heads if I flip a coin and times?  Don't tell me that again.  Huh?  You guys want it to be D, right?  How can it be?  Okay, so let's go through this.  Each outcome has a probability of each outcome has an equal probability. So that probability is one over the number of different outcome. How many different outcomes? Can you get when you flip a Fair coin and times?  To the end. This is just like the product rule is like each flip has two different choices and you flipped a coin in time right now the event this event e  is the number of ways you can flip a coin so that Atticus has exactly K heads will now let's just think about flipping a coin and you have this sequence of flips and you can think about maybe Tails or zero heads are one and this can translate to  the number of fixed density  binary strings  with K ones and we all know how to count that and she's k  Okay. So since it's the uniform distribution we can just add up the size of the event divided by the size of the sample space.  We got this any questions.  Okay, so now let's do some practice. Let's bring it back to.  The problems I gave you on the first midterm.  Okay, you guys can get your calculators out if you like.  So about if I say invalid pin cannot have two consecutive digits that are the same then how many possible valid pins are there? That's the question I gave you on the midterm. Okay. Now, how would I try? How would I use that result to answer? The second question? What is the probability that a randomly-selected four digit number has the property that no two consecutive digits are the same.  I should say.  if each  if each 4-Digit  number  is equally likely.  Okay, and if you ever see anything like this, this means this implies uniform distribution.  Which is good in this case because that means it just reduces to accounting problem, right?  To just count up the number that has a property divided by the number of four digit.  Okay, so  we just guessing here or  actually calculating  are you guys sure it's not d?  50% have this property. I guess that's unlikely.  Okay, so Ed. How'd you get a anybody?  Okay.  Okay, great any questions?  Okay, how about this one?  If a valid pain must have four different digits that are in increasing order.  Then how many possible valid pins are there? And then the probability question? What is the probability that a randomly-selected four digit number will be four digit four different digits in increasing order.  My God is India again.  can't be  all right. So what was how many different strings have this property?  10 choose 4  How many total strings are there 10000?  Yes, 10,000.  Which is 210 / 10,000.  0.0 night  weight is it d?  Is there a e?  0.021  Yes.  Any questions about this?  very unlikely  .021 is about 2% about a 2% chance.  Okay, last one.  Let's say your PIN has exactly three different digits then how many possible valid pins are there for this one?  I guess just guessing.  You think it's D. You think it's really up 2% chance that you'll have three exactly three digits.  What kind of hard to like think about that's why we have math.  to help  Okay. Do y'all remember how to solve this one?  Okay. So remember if you have three different digits than one of them is going to show up twice, right?  so  this is going to be the double-digit the double.  Okay, choose one out of 10.  Okay, this is going to be where?  the doubles are  Okay, so the in the positions, right?  And then so then you have two positions open and you can fill them with whatever you want. It just can't be the same as each other and it can't be the same as that one. So * 9 * 8  Open positions.  And you got 4320.  Any questions about that?  And you have 4320 / 10000.  Is this one be?  So it's like not.  I mean  Not that low of percentage. 43% is not  I wouldn't be surprised if you  picked a few random 4 digit numbers and they had this property.  picnic questions  Okay, let's look at another distribution called the binomial distribution. So this is where we can think about it as flipping the coin but now instead of thinking about each outcome being a sequence of coins. Now we're thinking about each outcome is how many heads came up? Okay. So the probability that they work a heads is the number of coin toss sequences with K heads / number of possible coin toss sequences, and so  We got this nice.  binomial distribution  and  this is okay. So this is  you have to think about it as a coma and it could be like any two equally likely events, right?  What else is equally likely?  1 or 0 in a bit stream sure.  Yeah, but those are equally likely.  So let's go to let's let's talk about what if the coin isn't fair. What if it's not equally likely what is the coin isn't fair Okay, so  So this is something that we call a Bernoulli trial. It's basically a some sort of experiment that has exactly two outcomes. And usually we call one of the outcomes of success and the other one a failure and there is a probability that you'll get a success. Okay, and so  a Bernoulli trials that the binomial distribution is a probability of getting exactly K successes in N independent Bernoulli trials when the probability of a success is p so  What is the probability?  that  what is this probability?  This one here.  When I put my thang.  Probability of getting exactly K successes in an independent Bernoulli trials. What is that?  Dang it.  I guess it is.  All right XD.  Okay, why is it D now? We haven't really.  Gone over this yet, but I think you guys all might know or have a feeling about this is that when you do independent events over and over and over again, then the probabilities multiply, right? If you flip a few coins, right? If you flip one coin you get 1/2 probability. If you if you put two heads right then that's going to be 1/2 x 1/2 1/4 probability.  just two possible outcomes one, the success has a probability of p and so that means that the failure has a probability of 1 - p  Okay, so that means n choose k?  That's counting. How many ways can you possibly organized?  And events work a of them are successes, right then if you have K successes, that's P to the K right store like suppose you had success failure success success failure failure failure success success. Maybe that was your sequence write each one of those successes has a probability of P.  and each one of the failures has a probability of 1 - p  so  First you count up the different ways. You can order them and each one of those orderings because multiplication is commutative has the same probability which is p to the K1 - P2 the + - K case that's where that comes from.  Okay, so can anybody else think of any other Bernoulli Bernoulli trials?  You had one.  passing or failing a class  whether or not you're procrastinate tonight.  Or I'm like a given Wednesday right over and over again. So what would be that probability?  That is 50/50.  What would you call a success that you get to procrastinate?  Yes, no.  Okay, so a success is that you don't procrastinate. So how was the probability of a success?  about 20%  or are you more like a 80%  hard to say  I guess it depends on the day.  Anybody else?  What is that?  Okay, the weather like whether it's going to rain or not in a given day, right?  Good.  So get the idea the Bernoulli trial is just an event that has two possible outcomes. Okay.  I think that was the same thing. Okay, let's go. Let's move on.  Heart and let's move on to conditional probabilities. So if you have certain information, it may change the probability of an event happening. So  for example  suppose E and F are events. Okay, and let's say that the probability of f is greater than zero. Then this is called a conditional probability and the way you say it is.  the probability  Avicii  given  Okay, so I know we've just mine been we've been talking about flipping coin so you can talk about it that way. What's the probability that I get eight heads given that the first three flips were Tales Ain't So you kind of think about how  Having that information affects the probability. Okay, and how do you compute it? Well,  you take their intersection the probability of their intersection and you divide it out by the probability of f  so I like to think about it kind of as like  Different kind of picture Okay. So let's say that this is our sample space here.  and this is e  and this is a chef.  I'm trying to find the probability of e e given f  So now when I say that what you should think about is now I'm I'm sort of like shrinking my sample space down and only focusing on app because I know F happened. I know after the event f is happening. So I know that I'm in that space so now  just focus on  and that's sort of like my new sample space and what portion of f am I trying to find the probability of well, I'm trying to find the probability of right and so I'm really only considering the part of he that intersected with f so that's kind of the idea. So you take the the intersection of E and F and you divide it out by your teeth the size of your new sample space.  Okay, good any questions about that?  Okay. So this this also gives us a way to calculate the intersection of two events if we know the conditional probability.  question  No.  pepper  maybe in certain circumstances but not in general because the probability of f given e  is equal to probability of e intersect F / probability of E.  What's that?  Oh, right, I guess if E and F have the same cardinality then they would then their conditional probabilities would be the same.  ESPN  now that be different it only works if they if he and F have the same cardinality.  But that's it. That's a good question and in fact.  There's a way to go from a given F to F given e and it's called Bayes theorem. And I don't know anybody who's who's taking any probability class probably knows about Bayes theorem. And you use it in like a bunch of stuff. Do you use it too kind of?  Predict the the likelihood of something happening based on something else. So what you can use like a Bayesian spam filter on your email where you say if my if this incoming message contains this particular word, what's the probability that is going to be spam? Right? And so you can kind of use that and have that word be an indicator for where it gets dumped into your track box will talk about that a little bit later. I don't know if we'll get to it today, but it's a very powerful theorem.  Okay. Next time we'll talk about is the Monty Hall puzzle.  Can't cuz this is like this kind of goes along with conditional probabilities because it's kind of like it does knowing more information. Does that change the outcome or does that change the probability of the outcome? Okay. So here's the idea is that there's a game show.  And there's three doors. There's a car hidden behind one of the doors and there's goats but hidden hidden behind the other two.  Okay, so the player gets to choose a door now if that was just the end of the story then it will be easy to calculate the probability. He would have a one-in-three chance of picking the car but they're kind of the twist of this game. Is that the hook the host opens another door to reveal a goat? Okay, then he gives the player the option to either stick with the door you chose or change? Okay. What I'm asking you is that is there a strategy that if you do know there is there a strategy that gives you the best possible probability of getting the car? Okay, and so  Is there a is the strategy to always swap is it up to always stay or is there no strategy is always just 50/50.  now when I when I think about this puzzle, I'm just thinking like  for a car to fit in a door that doors got to be huge. Right and then the other doors only need goats to fit in them. So they're going to be small. So why don't you just pick the big door?  Huh?  Open it's just like a huge like wooden goat.  Oh, okay. I never thought about that.  And then I was also thinking what if you want the go.  What is the car is a piece of junk?  Yeah, if you live on a mountain you can't drive the car, but maybe you could ride the goat.  You know goats provide milk and companionship and they're basically Nature's lawn mower.  right  garbage disposal lawn mower  So, I don't know the code doesn't sound so bad.  But let's all agree to consider the car as the 6s the winning prize.  Okay. So what are you guys say always swap? Okay. Well, let's talk about it before we get into it this problem.  Has sparked a lot of controversy in 1975. It was it was introduced by Steve Selden and then I guess so in 1990.  Marilyn vos Savant  writes like this advice column, right and in 1990 a reader ask for the solution of the Monty Hall puzzle, and she's like a genius.  Then so she people ask her like these types of questions all the time. So she published the correct answer and thousands of readers including phds and even professor in statistics demanded that she correct her mistake because it's that so weirdly non-intuitive that  they they they were kind of going on their intuition. It's instead of going on the mat just really kind of weird and hard to believe but  Yeah, they did that. So she built a simulator to demonstrate the solution so they could see for themselves how our and then they all shut up and  she one stop.  The correct answer is to always swap.  Okay, and why is that? Is anybody have any?  feeling of why  okay.  Okay good. So let's say you had well instead of a hundred I'll just do one two, three, four, five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. So yeah, just think of this is a good way to kind of convince yourself think of the other a bunch of doors and say I choose this one here, right?  now the  The Host  reveals at Goat  How do you draw a goat?  Kind of got to draw.  12 goats  How are you? Just copy paste them?  Does it supposed to be his ears in his horns?  I guess I should give him eyes.  And maybe skip this door.  Maybe give him a body.  It looks like a fox.  You going to put a g for gout?  Okay. Now he Reveals All Those goats didn't reveal that door. So it's kind of  kind of makes you think that maybe that's the the car is in that other door.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's kind of weird, right?  It's not 50% anymore.  right  That you were that lucky that you chose that one. Yeah, right.  exactly  funny how that's one way to think about it another way to think about it is I think about it like this.  If you swap you will always change what you picked originally right if you picked a goat originally and you swapped you'll get a car if you pick the car originally and you swapped you'll get a goat, right? So if you always swap.  then  there's a two-thirds chance that you picked a goat first and then you swap and get the car.  Should be two out of three.  Okay.  So for example, there's there's two third chance that you're going to pick the goat one third chance that you pick the car.  right if you pick the goat and you swap  You get the car?  Swap you get the car.  swap  You get the goat?  So now you have if you always swap have a 2/3 chance you get a car 1/3 chance you could go any questions.  Pretty insane now.  Took me a long time to convince myself that that was really the right thing.  Okay, so let's talk about another.  weird conditional probability  Are these probabilities equal and we're going to assume that?  Having children, it's equally likely that you'll have a boy or a girl.  and I guess  we might be a little insensitive that were also assuming that boys and girls are the only two genders.  But let's let's work under these assumptions. Okay, so there is equally likely that you 50% chance. You got a girl there's a 50% chance you get a boy. Okay. What is the probability that two siblings are girls if we know that the oldest is a girl and what's the probability that two siblings are boys if we know that one of them is a boy.  Okay, so we've got some explaining to do between these two things  So let's calculate them using what we know which is conditional probabilities.  Okay.  Let's do this one first.  What's the sample space here?  so  disprove this family or whatever they could have had.  a girl first and then another girl or what a girl first and then another boy or  a boy first and another girl or a boy first and then another boy  No, this is the sample space. Right? So the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of like a family to have two children. And then we're asking what's the probability that two of the siblings are girls. So that's an event right? That event is actually just one outcome of the samples, but then we're going to use the conditional.  probability  The oldest is a girl. Okay, what's the initial Distribution on the sample spaces?  uniform right because of this  Okay good.  What events are we conditioning on?  No, the one where conditioning on is the event.  event that  the oldest  is a girl.  right  And what is this event? We can write it out is Gigi, GB?  right  Okay, so we have this.  each outcome as probability 1/4  what events are we conditioning on?  so  hey is going to be the outcomes where the oldest is a girl. This is Gigi, g b and b is going to be outcomes where there are two girls G.  So, how do I write the probability the conditional probability?  P of what given what is it a given b or is it be given a  Be given a right probability that two siblings are girls given that the oldest one is a girl.  Be given a and you guys remember what this is?  Intersect be divided by what?  You guys remember?  It's the second thing, right?  so / probability of a  so  I should just stay here intersect B is just Gigi. So the probability of a or this is 1/4. / what's the probability of a  1 / 2  So that's equal to.  1/2  so if I know that the oldest is a girl in the probability that both of them are girls is when I have to make sense, right?  Okay, let's look at the other the other scenario.  Okay. Now we're looking at this one.  Now what are the conditions of the events were conditioning on?  The outcome where one of the children the siblings is a boy three events.  An outcome where two or boys that's one event and again C intersect D is equal to be be right.  And so which condition what are we conditioning on C given D or D given C.  D given seat right that there two boys given the fact that one of them is a boy.  so this is probability of C intersect D / probability of  D which is equal to 1/4 / 3/4, which is 1/3.  Are there different?  That crazy.  Any questions about that?  well  because  kind of like when you flip the coin, right?  To get like a heads and tails. There's two different ways. You could do it right you get a heads first and then a Tails we get a Tails first and then a heads and they're equally likely.  Oh, yeah.  Write sorry. Thank you.  Any other questions?  Okay, that's crazy, right?  Okay, so here's some other crazy stuff.  Simpson's paradox  Okay, let's say that we have this treatment.  This came from the comparison of treatment of renal calculi by open surgery percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.  Anybody have any like idea what type of medical procedure this is?  Kidney stones I think it's like they blast you with a soundwave and it breaks up the kidney stones or something.  stop  so treatment a for small stones that has 81 out of 87.  Pretty good.  Large stones that has 192 out of 263 right treatment treatment bee has 72-34 on to 74 small 55 out of 84 large.  so  what can we say here? Which treatment would you use?  You'd go with the one that they've done more trials, even if the percentage is lower.  Yeah.  That's what I want you guys to notice here.  If I know that I have a small Stone.  I'm going with treatment a right is better.  Hey is bigger than b?  if I  If I know that I have a large Stone, I'm also going with treatment treatment a is better than b.  But then why is be better than a in the combined?  number of successes  Because his wife.  Well, they both have they both have done 350.  Trials, right?  Okay.  Right you can you know if you do more.  It's just really weird.  I don't really get it.  I know but that is not weird that a beats be on every single like category, but then BBJ overall.  I'm just saying it's weird.  This is baby one way to kind of wrap your head around it when the less effective treatment is applied more frequently to easier cases, right it can appear to be more effective treatment. That's and you know, people can use this to  two kind of scare you in one direction or the other.  Okay any questions?  This might be a good stopping point question.  Well, maybe something that you can get it easier success rate. So it looks like based on these it's easier to to treat small stones right because we're both of those cases and make sense. Right easier to treat small Stone stuff since they got a lot of successes on the beach.  treatment  it could be a good look like it's a better treatment overall.  Didn't try as hard on the or didn't have as many treatments for the large stones.  San Diego "
