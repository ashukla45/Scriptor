    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast evening afternoon evening.  What time is it?  What week is it 8 week already?  Oh my God.  insane  we got some stuff to learn today.  Let's start off with independent events.  You guys remember what an event is?  What is an event subsets good? So two events E and F are independent meaning that if one the occurrence of one event does not affect the likelihood of the other event.  Right now we can translate this into conditional probabilities. Do you remember what this means Pia V?  the probability of e given F Okay, so  What would it mean that E and F are independent? What does that mean? It means that the probability of e given f  Maybe something to do with that.  Okay good.  Okay could be exactly so inmates were in math terminology then end up being independent.  Means that the probability of e given f is the same as the probability of he's kind of like knowing that f is going to happen doesn't doesn't change the probability of e happening.  Okay. So what else can we get from this right? This is kind of  What what we're trying to say, but now let's let's break it down into the definition of conditional probability. So probably be given f is the probability of a intersect F / the probability of a so solving for the intersection?  another  definition of Independence is that the probability of the intersection of two events is the product of their probabilities?  Okay, so using either definition is fine. Now, let's look at  these events  exercise. So let's say we're going to look at all length for bit strings and each length for a bit string is equally likely so then he is the event that the bit string starts with 1 and F is the event at the bit string contains an even number of ones are E and F Independence.  What are your first impressions?  Is get like if you were given the fact that the bit string starts with one does that affect the probability that there are even number of ones?  Do we have kind of a few competing things here?  which are  B&D so independent but not disjoint enf are neither disjoint nor independent.  And who's saying e?  Okay, so  What's a what's a look?  So you guys are.  So you're saying B&D, so either independent, so everybody is pretty much agreed that they're not disjoint.  And that's good. They're definitely not disjoint right because one  111 is an e and also one one one one is in F rights of the definitely not destroy, but are they independent? That's kind of the  the question  Okay, so let's actually plug everything in and see what happens. Really. What I want to know is.  Is does this equality hold? Okay. So what's the problem? What is the intersect F. What is this set?  1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0  1001  it's all of the length for Strings that start with one and have an even number of once they miss any.  Okay, what's the probability of E?  Or know what's what is I guess I'll do the probability of this thing.  Equals what?  Yes, 4/16 1/4 right now. What's the probability of E?  8/16 yeah, you can also think like half of the bit string start with 1/2 of them start with zero, so  Yeah.  and what's the probability of f  No.  I don't know. Maybe you can use it.  No, let's just let's write them all out. It would be the best way, right?  What what is f well you can have zero ones you can have two ones. So there's six of those right?  if that's all those  + 0  0011 and then all ones  how many are there?  8 right. So probability of f is also 1/2. Okay. So noticed that the probability of the intersection is equal to the product of the probabilities. Therefore it is independent because we showed this  any questions  Okay good.  All right. Let's play a little bit more around with conditional probabilities. So remember that this is the definition of a conditional probability.  We can solve for the intersection and get this thing here.  What do we know about intersection? Does it intersection have any properties?  Maybe I didn't ask it right.  Okay, if I what what's the relationship between intersect f&f intersect E4 the same because it is  intersection  is commutative  Good.  so that means that P of f intersect e which is p of f given e  x p a v e  Right, that means these things are the same.  Right. Now what we're going to do is use this to to give the conditional probability of a given B in terms of e given that and this is something called Bayes theorem Okay, so  We have we have this year. That's what I kind of wrote on the other side. And then if we solve for p of f given e then we get this right here and this thing is called Bayes theorem.  And it's really nice and it's really useful because a lot of the times we won't have F given any we don't have that probability, but we will have the probability of a given F. And so sometimes we need to know the probability of x given he's so this is a way to kind of convert 1 into the other.  Okay, so often times we won't have the probability of e and either and so we can do is split up that probability into a sum.  And this is this is the form of Base theorem that you usually see. I just want to mention something. Is that this year?  Why is it go through this?  Is equal to probability of Eazy-E wear these lines above F. Those are the complement of half because the idea is that the probability of Any Given ask times probability of f  Is plus the probability of e given F. Compliment X P give an f complement now, you're just basically taking the probability of e over the entire set.  It's all based on previous knowledge about how probabilities of two events relate to one another. How does one how does knowing that one event occurred impact the probability the other event occur? Okay. Let's look at an example.  So we have a manufacturer who claims that a drug test will detect steroid use 95% of the time.  what the company does not tell you is that 15% of all steroid free individuals also test positive k  10% of the Tour de France bike racers use steroids your favorite cyclist just tested positive using this drug. What is the probability that he actually used steroids?  What are you guys think first impressions?  close to maybe 85% because of false positive right question is a great question to use Bayes theorem for you see that we have the conditional probability in One Direction and we're trying to get it in the other direction we  So let's kind of break it down.  I'm going to  Define  ff2 be the set of all athletes that use steroids and E is the set of all athletes that test positive so noticed what we want to Define is the probability.  That my favorite racer use steroids given that he tested positive. They said that's what this is.  queso, what is  so this is what we want write a f f given e  Okay, so that's this value that we want. Okay. What do we know what we know what this is? What's P of e given F in words? What it how do you say that?  Can we kind of have like equal?  An hour now we're shifting.  Okay. So what is pme given F what it's the probability that e which is athlete tested positive given that he used steroids.  Let's be  if you can't really see that.  Okay, and what is it in the problem? Do we have access to that probability?  95%  entire denominator of what?  Yeah, but this is p a v e given F. Right 95% of the time means that it detects steroid use correctly.  So given that somebody use steroids.  this thing will detect  will give you a positive detection 95% of the time.  So that's this and we get that P of e given f is 95%  okay.  Any questions about that?  It means that means it detect steroid use so it does it works. Otherwise, you just say this drug. Maybe it's a placebo. It works it it test positive 95% of the time no matter who you give it to that doesn't really tell you anything. Really what you want is how well does it detect steroid use so given that somebody use steroids it can tell you you can tell you that they used it 95% of the time.  Okay, so  What about P of F and P of f complement? What are these? What are these in words? And what are these in percents?  PFF is what?  And how many is that?  Good 10%  npf compliment  90%  Okay, so these numbers are are important to to have in order to do this calculation, but  Often times these are kind of estimates right because maybe people lie on their who's giving out a survey to have them write that they've use steroids or not. I don't know maybe they lie in the survey. These ones aren't maybe or just an estimate or something. But let's just assume that they are there real.  Okay, so we have that now what what about P of f p of e given F complement the probability that you tested positive but you didn't use steroids. That's the what?  That's the false positive false positive.  Good.  Okay. Now I have all my ingredients. This is all I need you plug them all in and what do you get?  41%  Hey, so this is a lesson right that 95% is so strong as a such a strong effect on people right? You see that and you say oh wow. That is that is pretty darn good and then you see your favorite cyclist and he test positive in your life. Well, forget that guy. He probably he's probably taking steroids because of the 95% of the time but you have to figure out what is it. They're actually presenting to you and and given all the information. How does that reflect on what the test actually gives you  Pretty scary though, huh? How much you can kind of fool people with numbers.  Okay, so  I've one more example. We're going to kind of go through it a little quickly cuz basically just plugging things in butt.  Here, let's just I'm going to skip that one. Okay. So another another way people use Bayes theorem is they use something called a Bayesian spam filter on their email where they kind of read the email and look for certain keywords. And if those keywords are there, then it can stay with a certain probability that the message is spam.  Okay, so the word guichos here was Rolex personally. I don't have a Rolex and I don't intend on buying one anytime soon or  Rolex is like a really fancy watch.  Like really fancy like tens of thousands of dollars.  I mean, I would love to have a Rolex. Don't get me wrong, but  was that  well, I would love to have a Rolex but also a calculator watch movie have two watches the same time. But so pick a word that you don't really expect your normal email people to send you, okay?  Okay. So the data we have is that Rolex occurs in 250 out of 2,000 messages and 5 out of a thousand messages known to not be spam estimate the probability that an incoming message contains. The word Rolex is Spam assuming that is equally likely that incoming messages spam or not. Spam, right? This is like  sort of an estimation How likely do you think your  Email is getting spammed.  90%  Cuz it kind of depends.  Okay. So what we want is p of spam given that it contains the word Rolex, right? What's the probability that expand? What's the probability that I'm throwing it into spam filter correctly?  So that's a key of f e so, what is p a v f?  What is the probability of a given F. So that's the probability that the message contains the word Rolex given that it's spam.  was that  Given that it contains the word no, no, no.  wait  probability  contains  Rolex  given spam  Okay, we can all do this calculation good.  Would you guys say be Point 125?  What is that 250 / 2,000 right? Okay good.  So we have that probably be given f is .125 probability that you give an f compliment is .005 because it says that 5 out of a thousand messages. No not to be spam contain the word Rolex everybody in P of F and P of f complement or both half that's from this thing here.  If you plug it in you get Point 96 pretty good. Right seems like it's a pretty good spam filter. You don't really have to do much, but you can  Often times to do this. They will instead of just using one key word you get a better probability if you use more than one keyword, right and if they're both present than you have a better probability of throwing it away or if one or the other is present.  Then you can throw away more.  Okay any questions before we move on?  Okay. So the next thing we're going to do is random variables. So what's the motivation here to like talk about these things?  Win at craps? Yes.  Do well on the on the exam right now.  So I remember what we had before we had sample space we had outcomes we had events, right?  So what a random variable is is well.  Why do they call it random variables? It's not random and it's not a variable.  It's a function. Okay.  and it's a function that  That sends each outcome to a number. Okay, so it can be whatever you want. Let's think about the outcome of rolling two Fair six-sided dice so that the random variable could be maybe the sum of the two dice. That's what you're interested in when you're playing craps or  Monopoly or things like that?  Maybe it's the maximum of the two dice rolls, right?  Maybe it's the number of heads after flipping in Fair coins, or maybe it's the time that a randomized algorithm takes. So just think about it as a number that's associated with every single outcome. And that number really doesn't have to be any anything special but often times it will be ill correspond to something about the outcome.  so  in general a random variable  is a function from the sample space to the real numbers. So it's a often times we call it Big acts. So it's X goes from the sample space to the real numbers.  Remember that notation?  The distribution of a random variable X is a function from the possible values 201 and it basically is what's the probability that you're going to get that random variable value?  so distribution  Let's call it. I guess D that goes from the real numbers to 01.  And it's basically the probability that the random variable is equal to that real number.  Okay, let's some let's go a little bit farther. There's something called the expectation which is basically the average value of all rent all of the random variable values, okay.  It's really like average is a good way to think about it, but it's average is really only good when you're talking about a uniform distribution instead. What's the formal definition?  I want you to think about it in two different ways. One of them is going to be for every outcome. So as to the outcome for every outcome X the random variable of that outcome times the probability of that outcome and some of them all together Taste of the probability of the outcome X the random variable.  Can I switch to some over all that possible possibilities?  K the other definition is instead you some over all the possible values.  possible  random variable values  and you multiply the actual random variable value with the probability that the random variable will be equal to that value.  Okay, we should see some examples.  Going to start with some simple examples.  Okay, so what's the expected value of the dice after rolling it?  once a rolling  What is expected value of I should say of?  One died after rolling it once okay. So whenever you talk about expectation there has to be some sort of random variable involved this random variables very simple. It's just the value of the the dice the number of dots that are  Are face up after you roll it.  Okay, so according to the first according to the second definition.  The possible random variable values are one two, three, four five or six right? And since it's a fair dice, they're all equally likely.  So we're going to multiply 1 times the probability that X is equal to 1 what is that probability?  1 / 6  a 1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1/6 + 3 * 1/6  anybody know what this is?  3.5  that kind of gives you a sense that if you roll the dice a bunch of times roll the die a bunch of times the values would average out to 3.5.  Okay. Now let's think about if you roll two dice, these are all the possible possibilities, right and I want the written out and let the random variable to be the sum of the two dice after you roll a pair of dice. Okay. So this is for the random variable of 5 + 273 + 3 + 6 + so on the distribution is shown as the height of this graph.  They're both seven.  Okay, so the distribution here shows you what's the probability that you get a particular number? So for example, the probability that X is 7 or P of x equals 7 is equal to well, you can just look at the height of the graph. It's 1/6 or you can kind of calculated mathematically. How many different ways can you put numbers together to get 7?  There are 1 2 3 4 5 6 and there are 36 different possibilities total of 6/36, which is 1/6.  Also, you know.  Furthermore the probability that X is equal to 9 is p of x equals 9, which is 4 out of 36, which is 1 / 9.  Any questions about that?  Okay, good. Okay. So what's the expected value of this random variable we can do the same thing where we multiply every possible random variable value times its probability.  2 * 1 / 36 right? That's the probability of that guy three times 1/18 for x 1/12 and so on.  And you do all this and you get seven.  Any questions about that?  This kind of seems like a lot of work to do just to get this simple value. So we're going to see you in a minute, but there's a trick that you can use and calculate calculate this a lot easier.  Yeah.  products with one died  right exactly that's called linearity of expectation.  That's what we're going to look at in a minute.  Yeah, so maybe.  Okay, let's do this one.  What's the expected number of boys in a family with two children?  This is just easy, right?  should be this one why because  all the possibilities are girl girl that has a random variable value of what?  Your girl boy you have boy girl, and you have boy boy.  Write these are the these are the outcomes in the sample space. So what's the what's the random variable value of girl girl zero. What about girl boy boy girl one boy boy 2  stop what you can do in order to calculate. This is  Eat one of these outcomes has the same probability. So 2 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/4 + 0 * 1/4 is equal to  Okay. Now what if we had three children?  Apparently I guess I'll do this again.  Well now we have eight different.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a good guess I could guess.  Okay, good. Yeah, so you you guys are getting kind of The Hague.  But let's formerly go over what the what I mean by the linearity of expectation. So just here I just wanted to kind of note that the expected value doesn't actually have to be one of the possible random variable values. I just like  it's like we've seen here.  Okay. So let's look at some properties one is that it doesn't actually have to be a possible value right? We've seen that.  Another property is that it's going to always be in between the minimum and the maximum.  And the last property is something that is very powerful that you know, we talked about already that we're going to use over and over again the best trick for a lot of these expected value problems. Okay. So if x y are random variables in s and if a and b are real numbers, then the expected value of the sum of the random variables is equal to the sum of the expected values.  Okay, so I'll do like a little proof of on a sum of two and then you can just expand that song by humming it over and over.  So let's say that X is equal to X1 + X2.  Which basically means that X is always going to be equal to the sum of X1 and X2 on all outcomes.  Okay, so let's put in the the formal definition.  This is the definition of Acts because it's equal to x 1 of S Plus x a little ass.  Okay, that'll be a little ass right, but then you can split that song up into two sums.  Right and those two Psalms are the definitions of Eve X1 and effects to remind you that we did.  There is no assumptions about these random variables right dude, you just adding them together. That's it. Okay, so when we get to like independent random variables and things like that a might be tempted to think that this only works for independent random variables, but that's not true. It works for every random variable. It doesn't matter if they're independent or not. And sometimes when we do the problem it might kind of seem like we're we're doing a trick and that's why it's so powerful because it's independent of that.  Okay, let's go back to here. So let's let's apply this this Rule and this one should seem pretty easy because these events are independent of each other. Right? One of the one of the die rolls doesn't affect the other one. So it kind of makes sense that you'd have to add them together.  Queso X is equal to X1 + X2. So that means e of X is e of x 1 + 3 of x 2.  Right, which is equal to 3.5 + 3.5 which is 7.  X is the sum of the two numbers  it's not always going to be the case that you can split up a random variable into a sun. But when it is then you should use this linearity of expectation.  Okay. Now let's do an exercise.  What is the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads when you flip a coin and times?  Okay, so I guess if you had like a bunch of heads in a row like this.  That would count as one two three consecutive heads three consecutive pairs of heads. So we're just looking at those.  That kind of makes sense.  Okay, ready go.  This is I guess this is just going to be kind of a guess, right? What are you guys guess it's going to be?  Okay, good and mine is 1/4. Okay, so I don't know if you guys computed that mathematically or just guests or this and that but let's go through a way to approach this kind of problem because there is a really good way. It's using something called an indicator random variable.  Okay, here we go.  So  the random variable here  How do you say?  Okay.  so  the random variable here is the number of consecutive heads, right?  Now what we're going to do is to find this indicator this family of indicator random variables. What does it indicate a random variable is just a random variable that either has either outputs 1 or 0 kind of like indicate something happening. So in this case, we want our indicator of a random variable x i to be equal to one if the ice and I push first position are both one.  Why should we are both H are both heads and excise going to be 0 otherwise.  now  I claim that are random variable is just the sum of all of these indicator random variables. You're basically just counting them right you're counting them you're turning them on and off and then you're counting them.  so for example  if I had this  h h h t h h h h h t t h h let's say with positions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  X1 is going to be equal to what?  1 x 2  0 x-3 0 x 4  1 x 5  1 x 6 0 7 0 x 8 0 9 1 right?  How many pairs of consecutive heads are there there are 1 2 3 4 I just have to count up the the ones of all the indicator variables so now you can kind of see why  Acts of this outcome is equal to 4 and in general X is equal to the sum. I equals one up 2 N -1 of any questions about that.  Okay, let's go back here. And now compute what is the expected value of x i  Is it zero 1/4 1/2 1 or does it actually depend on the value? I?  Okay, good 1/4, right? How do we know that? Well?  the expected value of an indicator function of an indicator random variable is the probability that that random variable is equal to 1  Right. And what's the probability that is equal to 1 is the probability that the ice and I push first positions our heads with you do it this way. It's nice because you just kind of look at each pair individually. You don't have to look at the whole list anymore, right?  So we have this is equal to the probability that the ice and I plus first.  positions  are both heads  not equal to 1/4 because heads Heads is the possibilities that the iPhone died position could be.  So let's plug it in to what we had here.  Remember this you can turn to the expected value of x is equal to is equals 1 of 2 N -1 of the expected value of x i and we know it doesn't depend on I expected value of x is always 1/4. So this is equal to  the song Mi equals one up 2 N -1 of 1/4  Which is equal to what?  + - 1/4  got any questions  Okay good.  Okay.  So we used to indicate a random variable here. Now. What is an indicator random variable is a function from the sample space 201. It's still a random variable because it's mapping the sample space to the real numbers.  But you're only getting two choices. You only getting 0 and 1.  So what is the expected value of an indicator random variable?  well before we  Reveal the answer. Let's actually write out the definition of expected value.  So remember that expected value of x is equal to the sum over all the possible numbers in.  ax  probability that X is equal to our times are right. What are the possible values of this random variable?  1 and 0 so the sum is only going to have two terms.  Okay. So in this case you have X is equal to okay, so it's going to be 0 times the probability that X is equal to 0 + 1 times the probability X is equal to 1.  Any questions about that?  Okay good.  Okay, let's go to another example and see how we can use this random variable here.  Okay now.  I hope that you guys are all familiar with this type of algorithm find the maximum you basically given a list you set the maximum to be equal to the first value and you basically update that value whenever you find something bigger.  Any questions about that?  Okay, so  we can all agree that this algorithm will take Big O of end time to do right because, cuz comparisons are our constant time and you just basically go through and -1 iterations.  Okay, what if you were concerned that resetting the maximum?  To the new value what if that like cost a lot of time and you wanted to you wanted to know on average. How many times do you have to reset it?  So if the if the list is fully sorted, right?  From increasing to decreasing in increasing order.  Can you have to update it every single time? Right you have to update a 10-1 times if the list was in decreasing order then you wouldn't have to update it at all. Right. So it's going to have to be something in the range of write 0 up 2 N -1. What do you guys kind of expect it to be that's where this term expectation comes from. Okay. So really what are we what are we Computing here? We're saying that X is the number of times the max changes for a random input size.  What do you guys think? It's going to be?  I should have put that as a quicker question. Okay. Now let's try to figure out what would be a reasonable random variable at a reasonable indicator random variable to use for this.  changes on Ice iteration  and 0 otherwise  good. Just remember these indicator variables are not supposed to be super complicated and there's just supposed to tell you what happens at 1 and 0 and they're usually supposed to be one When you're counting some make we're counting the number of times Max changes. So let the indicator B1 whenever Max changes.  Okay good.  I guess we already kind of.  Answered that's okay. Stop.  Going to be be right.  If Nai is bigger than Max.  Then you change it. So what's the probability that a is bigger than Max? That's we're going to do next.  Okay, so that's this is the indicator random variable.  Now we should all kind of agree here. Now that the random variable X is the sum of all those indicators just like we stop before you just counting up all the ones.  Find the expected value of x is the sum of all the expected values. So the next thing you need to do is figure out what is EFX. I I want you guys to try to figure this out. Okay?  Yeah, they say they're all unique and let's say that it's randomly sorted. So any Arrangement is equally likely.  Okay, ready go.  I'll give you kind of like a little hint this means.  that way I  is bigger  then all of a 1 through a i - 1  right cuz that's what the algorithms doing. Okay, ready go.  maybe another way to rephrase the  this is to say  what is  the probability  that  hey I is or let's say it like this.  the maximum  of a list  With I elements.  occurs  at the end  that kind of help.  Okay. Does anybody have a guess of this?  1 / I  now you can think about it in the in the sense that that last element is equally likely to be any of those other eye elements and it's sort of doesn't matter what the rest of them are. We're just trying to find the probability that in a list of size. I the maximum one is at the end.  Just want to cry.  Okay, so we have that ye of X is equal to the sum. I equals two up to end of one over I  Anybody know anything about this some?  Are you guys seeing this type of sun before?  Do you ever heard of the harmonic series?  The legendary beast. Yeah its claim to fame is that it's unbounded as n approaches Infinity, right? It it diverges.  But it diverges slowly. Is anybody know at what kind of rate it grows?  big'o  login  Okay, so you can expect on average there to be around log and many.  What's actually like?  more like  around the natural log of n  so you can expect there to be around natural log of and many times that you update Max.  Algorithm only word for Android are left at least two.  Well, if they're just one value, then you just output that value at the Max Wright.  Yeah, it's just not very very interesting problem. If and is one.  Cuz it's a sum of nothing.  Okay, any questions about that we get around login?  the reasoning is  well  Yeah, we don't have to go. Well, I'll just I'll just drive right here, but  If you look at the graph 1 / X, right?  then  the Riemann sum  is approximated by the area under the Curve.  And the area under the curve is integral of 1 over X DX, which is anybody know.  natural log X  pussy  Yes, thank you for that.  and so that's that's kind of a  kind of a quick sort of justification of why it's login.  Okay, let's move on.  Another way that we can use linearity of expectation is too kind of break it up into cases. You don't have to actually  Well, this is kind of like maybe a different trick, but it's sort of a sort of the same type of idea.  Okay. So what you do is you take your your sample space and you break it up into two parts a and compliment a then you figure out what's the expected value in one part plus the expected value of the other part.  So let's look at an example.  If x is the number of pairs of consecutive heads when we flip a coin three times, what is the expectation of x?  so  We're going to do is split up the sample space.  Guy is going to be the set of all.  No, I want the middle middle flip is heads.  And a compliment would be the middle flip is Tails.  Okay, so, let's see what how that works.  Oh, that's just figuring out from using the definition.  Yeah.  So you guys can do this as an exercise.  Okay, try to figure it out using the using directly from the definition.  Okay. Now let's use the conditional expectation. Let a be the event that the middle flip is H which subset of s is a  okay good.  Pretty good on that one. It's pretty easy.  So is this one here?  right  Okay. So this is the formula that we're going to plug it into. Okay. Well, we just figured out was that a is has four outcomes, right? So what's the probability of a  4/8 right  and what about a compliment?  also four of Ray right or 1/2  Okay now.  This is called a conditional expectation. This is saying what is the random variable value given that?  The outcome has to come from a compliment. So if the middle flip is Tails How many pairs of consecutive heads? Will you have zero good. So that's why I did the middle flip because this whole thing turns out to be zero.  It's kind of a way to get around that.  Okay.  So this is Middle flip is an aged there can't be any pairs. So this guy is 0  And if the middle flip is H the number of pairs of consecutive heads actually equals to the number of heads in the first and last flips. Okay, so it's going to be  This is going to be Tails heads Tails. This will be heads Heads tails and Tails heads heads and this one will be has headsets.  and each one of those is  equally likely right. So it's a quarter each for each one of those because we're just looking in the set a compliment. We're not looking in the whole Space anymore. That's what this conditional probability means.  okay, so the expected value of x given a is 1  case we get  1/2 * 1 +  1/2 * 0  equals 1/2  All right, that's good.  Okay, any questions about that?  All right.  one more example ending condition  okay, so this is  suppose you're doing some sort of Bernoulli trial remember what that was? It's like something that has a success and a failure. So maybe it's like you're playing Solitaire and you either win or you lose if a probability of winning, let's say you really want to win so you keep on playing until you win a game. What's the expected number of games? You have to play before that happens?  Each time you have a child that has a probability of P of being left-handed and suppose you really want a left-handed child for some weird reason and you just keep on having children until you have a left-handed child.  Okay. Let X be the number of games or the number of kids until the ending condition is Matt. What is the expected value of x? What do you guys believe what you guys think? What's a gas?  Okay, it's kind of BNC right because pee is so small number. So one of her pee is a big number, for example, if it's if p is equal to 1 then one of her pee is equal to 2, right if you have a one in ten chance of having a planks of winning at Solitaire. It's going to take you an expected 10 games to win, right? What's the probability someone's left-handed. Does anybody know?  How big is the high?  I don't know 1 and 7 or something.  Okay, so  Let's kind of show why it is that case Okay, so if we want to do directly from the definition right then what are the possible random variable values?  I guess so.  I don't I don't know exactly. Do you actually know the is that going to affect the  true  Yeah.  I don't know.  Okay. Anyhow.  We can go directly from the definition. What are the possible random variable values for this ending condition thing?  Well, I can play Solitaire once and went on the first time. So that's good. So the one is a possibility I can play at once and fail and then win for two of the possibility write 3 as a possibility for the possibility is actually  There are infinitely many possibilities here right just get so unlucky that I lose every time.  for as as big of a number as you want  Okay.  so  to figure this out.  Well, the probability of x equals I is the probability that you don't stop at the first i - 1 x + you do stop at the ice time, right? So it's 1 - P2 i - 1 x p. Thanks. Thank you. Fail i - 1 times and then you win on the ice time.  And then you some that up.  412 Infiniti  I could go to the all the possible things.  now this is not easy to  simplify  So we're going to use our trick.  conditional expectation  the way that we're going to split it up is the outcome where you went on the first try and the outcome where you lose on the first try  It is going to be the success at the first try.  Okay for the probability of a happening is p write the probability of getting a success probability of getting a left-handed child. Probably winning at solitaire.  And the probability of a complement is 1 - P so those are easy.  what is the expected value of x given a  One right cuz you're just going to stop.  is equal to 1  Gangster that's what we have.  Now this is the weird part.  the expected value of x given a compliment  Okay. Well you've already failed so that's definitely one right?  But then you can get to start fresh right that failure. Don't let it get you down do it again. It shouldn't affect the way you perform in the neck in the next trial, right?  It's like you're starting from nothing.  Cuz you tried once and then the same situation from the start.  So you get this nice equation. It's just a equation where the variables eat of X. It should be easy to solve.  You guys could do this as an exercise.  want to repeat  I mean, I know that you guys already knew that it was one of her pee, but this is a way to do it and you can you can use this same technique for other things. Like what if you wanted to know, how many games did you have to play before you win twice in a row or before you have?  two left-handed kids in a hurry  Something like that.  Okay. So how much time do we have left?  Maybe we'll stop there.  any questions  Yeah.  Is a lot today though.  But I know that it's hard because some some people have seen this stuff already. Have you guys taken probability before?  Play music with a good Refresher.  I probably should write. Yeah, I'll do that.  Yeah.  a while ago  choosing them play  random boy who dimmer not from that say or is it like already done?  How's it going to look at the question again? What is it say it says that you know, you're okay and then it says what is the probability that what the person before you or someone that gets like project manager? Oh, yeah.  so  is it picking them randomly, right or?  2/3 day fix randomly, but he says he let you go to your boss and tells you you're going to stop and then you're going to be one.  That's not random anymore. Yes. Yeah, your your thing is is chosen. You haven't chosen.  Oh shoot.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
