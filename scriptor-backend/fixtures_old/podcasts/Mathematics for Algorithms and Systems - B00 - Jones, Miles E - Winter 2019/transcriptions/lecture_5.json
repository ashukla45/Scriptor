    "Full Transcript": "Broadcast, okay, so let's get started.  tonight  So I guess I'll start with a an announcement about the exam.  next Tuesday  at 8 p.m.  I forgot what room it is, but it's on the website.  I think it's somewhere in Center.  Okay, what is it going to cover?  Basically going to cover everything up to and including this lecture here. Okay. So basically it's going to be counting.  recursions  and Big O notation  What's the main thing there's already like a practice problems that are in the website under the extra resources. Some of you may have already found them.  They have some good practice problems and  I think the solutions are on there too. So try out the practice problems first, and then you can look at the solutions. So  You can have a sheet of notes.  one sided  handwritten  sheet  of notes  K any questions  All right.  first began  Let me get my clicker thing ready.  Okay.  isn't it be a  Yes.  Okay, which one of these functions?  Do you think has the same rate of growth?  Queso the functions I have here are two to the end.  3 m squared + 10 squared  Frequency is ba.  Is that working for you guys?  okay, we have about a third of the class saying see another third or 2/3 saying C and will not change but  okay.  A lot of people are saying see and then some people maybe a quarter of the class now or staying so in between and squared + 3 in squared or they're all different.  Okay, so if we're in a Calculus class.  Then what is the rate of change is the derivative?  So that would be here and be to the end natural log to he rode B6 end and he would be two in so they're all different.  right  But we're not in a Calculus class.  right  And so we're going to sort of treat them and that's why I put same and quotations. We're going to treat same in a different way. Okay, and we're going to actually treat Reed and squared + 10 squared as the same rate of growth because they differ by only a constant multiple. And so if two functions differ by only a constant multiple, they have the quote on quote same rate of growth and then we'll put some mathematical rigor into it and Define notation in terms to to talk about how to put that into a more specific definition.  Okay. So this is kind of a turning point in the class one of many this whole time. We've been counting things and it's been important that you count things exactly down to the last one, right? I want exact numbers for that that's useful in a lot of ways. It's useful to be able to do that.  But what else what is also useful is the thing to think about how the rate of integer sequences grow? Okay, we're going to shift gears and and talk about the rate of integer sequences and how they grow without being exact. We're just kind of want to get a ballpark or talk about what other functions grow like this one.  Okay, so let's start off with these two functions that we claim to be quote on quote the same. Okay. So let's consider is in square G of NH3 + square what happens to f&g when you double its input size and when I say double the input size, I mean double n right?  is it that they're both * 4 is it that F doubles and G triples, isn't that f x 4 and g x 12 is it that d e f squared and g x squared * 3  Okay, let's take a look here.  Okay good. So a lot of you guys are saying that they both.  multiply  by 4  Good, let's look at an example.  Let's suppose we have a sequel to let's say 2.  Half of 2 is equal to what for?  Angie of 2 is equal to 12 right now what happens when I double the input?  half of 4 now is equal to  16  mg of for now is equal to what?  48cc how when you double the end the result is multiplied by 4.  That makes sense any questions about that.  Okay, good. So  That is it. It's in that sense that they grow at the same rate. Okay, they behave similarly when you increase the input.  So when f&g grew up the same way you say same rate you say that f is Big Theta of G and we'll talk more about that a little later.  so  why is this type of thing important? And why are we considering these two growths the same? Well, it's because we're going to use this asymptotic notation to talk about the rate that  the rate at which function of algorithms take to to solve a certain input, right?  And so computers get faster and faster every year my computer might be slower than your computer. So the rate that the computer can do we want to find a measure of how fast an algorithm is independent of how fast computers are. Okay. So this is going to be sort of our our measure the quantity that we measure how fast does it grow in terms of Big Data Big O and stuff like that definition.  The first we're going to start with Big O.  And you'll see that with use a few different notations. Sometimes you'll see a set inclusion. I'll try to stick to that one. Cuz I like the way that that kind of describes big O big O of Giovanni is actually a set of functions.  But often times you'll see this to I mean this is this is more common. I think it's just say equals and that might be a little confusing or may throw you off. But just remember that those those mean the same thing. Okay, so informally  big'o it's kind of like a less than or equal to it kind of said something like G gross just as fast or faster than n then f  or in other words  in other words, do you guys use that?  No.  AKA  What's better?  death of grows  slower  or  just as slow.  as G of n  base of think about it as this kind of less than or equal to think.  mathematically a question  Yeah, big OMG event is going to be a set and we'll talk about that in a minute. And we're saying f is an element of Big O of G of n but informally with them what you should think about is that F grows slower or at the same rate as G.  oh, that's just  that's just notation.  That's just people being lazy about notation or being.  Not taking care.  Even though that's the more common notation that you'll see.  unfortunately  Okay.  So what does it mean? Let's look at the actual definition.  So I'm in this class for these types of things we're going to to restrict ourselves to a positive value functions. You can you can Define them for negative value function, but it just doesn't really meet our requirements that we're going to use them for we're basically going to be using them for run times and you can't have negative run time. So let's just think about them as positive value function.  Okay. So this thing in the box that is the notation, the actual definition is that there are constant C and K such that is less than or equal to c x g of n for all and greater than or equal to K. Okay, so maybe more informally what is this mean is that you can multiply G by a big enough number and go far out right make and really really big and at some point the the graph of G will overtake the graph of f forever.  You're allowed to multiply by any number you want and you're allowed to go as far out as you want. The the only thing is that you need to have the the property that g will overtake after ever after that point.  was that  Sure.  Sure.  I mean, it's just it's just that there exists these Constance Wright saw.  If there exists a constant greater than 0 sure we could write that if you like.  Any other questions or comments?  K is like  I think about the funk think about these as like functions on a graph, right.  And maybe maybe like g&f overtake each other like cross each other a bunch of times and then at some point G kind of takes over right? It's okay. Is that point where G takes over this is so you can ignore everything before k?  prove this  yeah.  Yeah, and I'll give you some methods on how to prove it.  Okay, let's look at an example.  If f is 3 m squared + 2N + G of n is N squared.  then what consoles can we use to prove that f is Big O of G of n or  or do you claim that f is not big old GE oven?  What do we?  Give one of the multiple answers.  Or maybe I'll put it in E.T.  multiple answers  Okay.  see  A lot of people say he good. That's true. That's actually correct.  Let's go through each one of them and you can kind of see how they work. Okay so far.  What this is saying, is that ever been which is 3 + squared + 2N.  Is less than or equal to?  1/3 * and squared  For all n greater than or equal to 2. Is this true or false?  This is false.  Right, you can even say that for when n is equal to the left hand side is bigger than the right hand side. So that already shows that it's false.  Okay. How about this one? This is saying that 3 + squared + 2 N is less than or equal to 5 and squared for all and greater than or equal to 1 is this true or false?  This actually turns out to be true.  And one way to kind of convince yourself is to make a table. That's that's not a foolproof, but maybe you can just sort of get a sense that.  5 * G is going to overtake f after K is equal to 1.  Okay, so b4b, we found these two witnesses, right? We found the witnesses to make the the statement true and so C is equal to 5 K is equal to 1 is enough to show that f is Big OMG.  Whenever you have found Witnesses, you can always increase them and they'll still work.  right  if this works for see then if I make sea bigger, it'll work for that bigger number, right because all I'm doing is increasing the value of the function. Also if C works for everything Beyond k then it'll also work for everything Beyond K plus one or k+ to write and so you can increase both of them and for that, you know following that c is also correct if B is correct in csgo to be correct to  Are there any questions about that?  Okay.  So what are some functions that are in this family now? I want you to think about Big O of Ativan Big O of a function as a set or a family of functions. So what types of functions are in there just shot him out.  Which one?  quadratic, so any quadratic  Kane linear  Any constant?  Huh?  logarithmic  Which geometric?  Signs have negative values. I want to just talk about the the things I have positive values, but I guess  okay, so like  negative  powers  I'm going to go just say something about this. This is actually right, but we're not really going to encounter these so much cuz the functions were going to look at her mostly increasing and so I'll just put it in parentheses square root.  Anything like that?  questions about that  OK Google  Okay. So here's a few approaches. How do you determine it while one is that? You look for the constant C in k?  And then you prove that they're actually Witnesses. How do you prove that maybe using induction or something like that? Or you can use kind of these properties so domination if you ever find that f is less than G for all values then it certainly the case that f is Big O of G.  Okay, the converse is not true though, right?  Because we've already seen something like that. We saw that 3 + squared + 2N.  Is Big O of N squared?  Write 3 in squared + 2 and is always bigger than in squared, but it's still in Big O of M Square. Why is that?  Right, they different kind of by this constant multiple, okay.  Yeah, it's really the powers that you want to look at. Okay, and that's that's what we're going to get down to this. Some is maximum.  Hey, so we have domination transitivity if one is bigger of the other and that was big old something else than the first one is bigger over the last one.  add activity in multiplicative multiplicative multiplicative multiplicative a t  Basically, if you have f is Big O of G and you multiply both of them by the same thing, then the result is big old the other result.  I mean you have to make sure that the thing u x is not negative.  okay, and then ignoring Constance, right, so  constants coefficients they don't really matter so much just like we've seen  Okay, so this gives us a way to kind of simplify these things. Look at the terms one by one drop all the constants all the coefficients and then keep only the maximum term the one that grows the fastest and that'll be that'll be a way that you can simplify them.  Okay.  so  let's look at an example.  What could Giovanni be in the following expression? Okay, so we have three and squared + + login + 2 + is in Big O of G of n  Okay, so we have around half is saying be happy saying.  Well, she is a really nice choice, right in fact.  This function is Big Theta of N squared when it's actually grows at sort of the same rate. And so it is true, right you can have this to be in Big O of N squared that one works. There's another one that works, too.  And Cubed is also bigger than cubed.  Right because the function on the left grows slower or just as slow as in cute. In fact that grows strictly slower write the a a quadratic lower than a cubic.  questions about that  both of these are right.  I'd say that this one is kind of more accurate or more.  Or tighter. Okay. So this is a this is called a  tight  found  was that  Like big oven to the 4th.  Yeah, that's fine or Big O of to the end or something like that. Sure. Those are all work.  all of those things for  Okay. Good ISO.  So one way to kind of test to see if one thing is Big over another we can use this limit rule. Okay, and I'm going to change it up a bit because I actually have a stronger version.  queso  Is FN Big O of G of n well?  If you take the limit as n goes to Infinity of F Ave n / G of N and the the limit is some finite value.  Or another words that converges to something or another word that does not diverge to Infinity.  then  Or whatever that if and only if f is bigger so you get both directions here so you can use the the values of the limits to the show if something is Big O of something else.  I want to stop the clicker.  And see where you guys are at.  So it's about 70/30. So why don't you guys take a minute to talk it over with your neighbor? See if you guys can all come to the same consensus. Maybe use this rule.  as a justification  Yes, let's put it together here.  So limit as n goes to Infinity 3 to the end over to to the end we can rewrite this ass.  3/2 to the end and that's equal to what?  Infinity right and since this is a if and only if statement that implies that f is not Big O of G of n  Take questions about that.  to the end  Is Big O of 3 to the end?  true  Yes.  Right because if you take their limit, you're going to get a constant you're going to get zero.  Right because 2/3 is less than 1 so 2/3 to the end will the limit of 2/3 the end will go to zero.  Any other questions about that?  to enter the one  3 to the 3 in  2 N is Big O of 3 to the 3 n like 3 to the 3 to the Ender 3 to the three.  3 * 3 MI  3 raised to the 3 and Power.  Well, that's just take the limit limit as n goes to Infinity of 2 to the N / 3 x 3 and that's just equal to limit as n goes to Infinity of 2 to the N over 9 to the end and then you get limit as n goes to Infinity of 2/9 to the end.  And a zero, so yeah.  was that  so like negative inside the thing, so we're not going to use those because those kind of functions will give you sort of imaginary values at  at half  We only want positive value functions.  And mainly we're really going to look only at increasing functions increasing positive value functions.  That takes care of a lot of like weird ones.  Any other questions?  Okay.  So why is it the case that if the limit is a is a constant value then we get one is bigger over the other well.  Is everybody here taking calculus before?  Yes.  So what does it mean for a limit to converge to some constant? See it means that?  For any Epsilon greater than zero remember these proofs?  There exists some and such that.  the absolute value write the distance between the the ratio and the the value is less than Epsilon for all n greater than n  Let's just rearrange this a little bit and you can sort of see where it comes out.  Okay, so we can take this and call it a half of an over G of N - c is less than Epsilon is greater than negative Epsilon, right?  How you deal with those absolute values? Really? We're only going to be focusing on this part here, okay.  so let's add C to both sides and we get F of n over G of n  is equal to C + Epsilon now as x g of n on both sides and we get half of n  oh, sorry, that's not equals that's less than  Ativan is less than C plus Epsilon x g of n  for all  greater than big n  Does this look familiar at all?  This is just like the definition of Big O.  This is just like the definition of f is Big O of G. Right. I've replaced C with C plus Epsilon my replace K with big in this will imply the big questions about that.  Do you could do the other direction in a similar way?  Okay, let's move on.  So big O isn't the only asymptotic notation thing. We're going to be using there's Big O, there's big Omega and there's big Theta.  So big all we've already talked about we've defined and everything. OK Google Mega f is Big O Negative g means that g is Big O of f Pace was sort of the reverse. So if you think of big though, it's kind of like this less than or equal to Big Omega is kind of like a greater than or equal to.  Bendix data is the intersection of those two sets.  It means that a van or in other words.  Ativan is Big Omega of Giovanni.  Kick-Ass impossible  Those are big Theta of each other.  Right because you can you can multiply one of them by a big number and then I'll dominate it or you can multiply the other one by a big number and it will dominate it.  Okay. So what are fuck what functions are in the family big state of N squared?  Okay. Yeah quadra-trac quadratics.  Not Cubix only quadratics. We're talk about big stayed out here. So big fader. Remember, this is like the type found. This is like everything that grows at the same rate or at a rate X some constant multiple.  And this is sort of the thing that I want you to be doing on your individual homework if you haven't looked at it yet.  And I do apologize that it's so that you know, we didn't get to it till today. It's more of just like I wanted you to to play around with it as an exercise, you know, so  What's that?  Yeah, I still want you to turn it in.  But I was hoping that you maybe like read ahead.  Turn off.  This is what I want you to do basically is take those functions and simplify. I'm down to like 1  one member of the family that's in it's sort of simplest form. You know what I mean? Like, this is big Theta of N squared this this contains a bunch of crazy, looking quadratics and crazy looking functions, but they're all sort of part of that family, right?  If you wanted to find the tightest balance.  Yeah, I generally I want you to find the tightest bound. It's not always going to be possible.  When we start talking about like algorithms.  For the individual homework, you don't need to prove it.  Just really want you guys to kind of try it out.  more like a warm-up  Yeah for problem 3 you don't have to put justifications. You can just write down the thing.  All right.  so we have actually we have limit laws for all of them and they're all actually if and only if  Let's look at them. This is the one that we looked at already the big old one.  If you find out that your your limit is some fine art value then f is Big O of G. Okay, if  you find out that your limit is some nonzero finite value. Then f is big O big Theta of G. If you find that your limit is either Infinity or some non zero value. Then you have f is Big Omega of G case of these are things that you can use you can write them down on your note sheet. You can use them in the group homework to justify your claims.  And there if and only if so, they will actually work as disproving things also, okay.  so  I just want to look at this top one just for a second before we move on.  if F has an over G of an converges to some constant, that means that for the rest of time half of an is going to be around Cee times bigger than G of n  And so it's sort of like it's it's converging to this sort of constant multiple of G event. So that's why you get this Fade Out Here.  Right, so we'll look at a few examples, but maybe let's just let's throw some examples out there.  Yeah.  0 is finite that's why I didn't put it but you we can put it in there.  is finite  including  0 ranked  because remember if it's big stator then it's both Big O and big Omega.  I will always be the case.  We might not get away.  No, because this is saying if your limit goes to some nonzero constant, then you get big Theta and so think about the limit of f over G is C. That means the limit of G over f is 1 / C. So both of those are constants bigger than 0  Because you can have both.  You have them both be true. You can actually have all three of them be true.  If the constant if you have a constant, that's let's say F / G converges to 12 today. Then that means that f is Big Theta of G and that implies that f is Big O of G and F is Big Omega of G.  How can you have any bigger than zero not be Infinity if it's not fine?  Omega cake  He is bigger than 0 but like.  Yes, she has some constant. Like let's say C is 12 right then it would fall under that category and you would have f is Big Omega of G?  Yeah, Big O is like a upper bound like f a big old Jeep means that g is an upper bound of f f is Big Omega of g means that g is a lower bound of f right and then say that means that they are actually growing at the same rate modulo some constant multiple.  Livonia, let me just do something real fast on a skip this next question.  Okay, let's talk about how to prove that f is Big O of G.  Okay, so we can simplify each side right by using that method if it's the simple enough function than you can just cancel out all the terms cancel out all the coefficients on on f&g and if they end up being the same thing then one is bigger of the other.  For this type of problem would like would we be given what the dream did of a logarithm that's not natural laws is for for those of us that don't remember.  Seems like it when you're taking the limit rule. You do want to take the red paper fault movement and do not need are you doing like a little Beatles rule. I was sort of hoping that everybody knew the derivative of logarithms.  Oh.  Do you at least know what the derivative of a natural logarithm is?  Yes, that's enough.  Well, let's make it natural log.  Here's a good beers a fun fact.  Give me a fun fact. Let me do it on a  bring up a good point, you know.  Bring up a good point.  log base 2 of n  is this big O of log base E Event?  Psy  He is bigger than 2.  But does that mean that log base B of an is bigger than log base 2 of n?  Wouldn't make it smaller.  You must make it more transparent.  Instead of Eevee. Let's go. Why is that?  Silas Goten  Is that true?  write log base 2 of  let's look at the limit.  limit as n goes to Infinity of log base 2 of n / log base 10 of n  You guys remember the log rules?  log base 10 of 2  Where's the N Go?  How do I do that?  This is around what 1/3 or something point to something?  I don't know.  I don't know what it meant.  I know it's something like that.  Point three so I mean what what's the what's the point here? It's a nonzero number. So they're actually big Theta of each other. In fact, a log of any base is Big Theta of a log of any other base. So that's why I was a little free when I was like a week we can just throw any based on there because in terms of how they grow their all constant multiples of each other no matter what the base is.  Okay, pretty cool, huh?  Right, right. Not for exponents Spurlock's.  Okay, so let's go back for this thing. So now let's just call it log base e so we could take the derivatives.  Okay.  So one way to maybe get started is there's this some  There's this website called Wolfram Alpha have you guys?  Have you guys ever used it? Yeah.  So I generated these tables using Wolfram Alpha. It's an it may be a nice way to kind of start to kind of get a feel for how the functions are growing and you can see that and login squared is bigger than n sqrt in for a while until you get to about. I don't know. Let's say  80 something like that and then  Okay, so  How am I actually going to show that one is Big all the other you guys believe that end log and squared is Big O of and square root in right? So let's try to show it one way to do. It is by using the limit rule.  Okay, so we can cancel out the ends we can use the log rules.  to get to  login  over square root in  and I'm hoping that you guys have a sense that logs grow slower than any polynomial. Let's just be more thorough and go through the actual proof. So the way to do this is to use l'hopital's rule. So take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator.  So you get to * 1 / n / 1/2 * 1 / sqrt in?  Yeah, let's do log e.  Yeah, but it's just log so it's just general.  Waiting for you guys. What is log without any?  Okay, if you're in a chemistry class or an engineering or an architecture classes 10, if you're in a math class is easy, and if you're in a computer science class at 2.  Well, if you're so this is this is kind of an intersection of math and computer science. So it's easy when it's easier to use Easy like in this case and it's too when it's when it's easier to think about it as two.  So it's fluid when you take the derivative of any log, it's going to be one over and time some constant and that constant might be like this complicated mass of natural log of whatever but it doesn't matter in this case, right because the constant the constant coefficients don't matter.  stop  That's why I'm being so free about the the base.  If you like we can multiply it by what is it? You have to multiply it by like 1 / natural log 10 or whatever, but it doesn't matter. Just get rid of that and put that e on there.  Are there any how this turns out to be four Times Square Root n Over N, which is 4 / sqrt, which is 0 if you take all the limits and stuff.  I know it's kind of a mess kind of a pain, but I want you to kind of get a feel for these things convince yourself.  Okay, let's do some more examples question.  Exactly good point. This is not that's not big state of the other thing because we got a zero here and not a nonzero constant.  good point  Yeah.  or induction  Okay. So let's look at a few of these examples prove or disprove these things. Okay. So let's look at this one first limit as n goes to infinity and squared over 2 to the end. You can use l'hopital's rule. I'll let you guys do it as exercise.  This is going to be equal to zero.  So that's true, right?  What about this one?  To the end over and squares going to go to Infinity.  So that's false.  And that's enough for me to if you show me that it goes to zero or goes to Infinity. You can call those limit rules and show me that I do want to see the work of how you got those. Okay?  Okay, how about this one?  This one we can simplify both sides right simplify the thing on the left. How did I tell you to do that? Take away all the coefficients?  And then eliminate all the lower terms right only keep the highest term.  So all I'm keeping his four into the four and certainly enter the four is Big O of n to the four.  Okay, so maybe you guys can do this one as exercise.  Cuz I want to look at this one here.  And choose three is that Big O of N squared?  You say yes.  All right. Let's do a quicker.  Who says yes who says no.  we kind of got a  Some portion of the class says yes that portion is feeling less confident about their answer seeing the other answer.  Okay, so let's think about how we going to prove it. What's the way to prove this thing any?  Okay, good expand it and simplify. Okay. What does that look like?  And choose three is at what is that? Actually equal 2 + x + -1 x + -2 / 3 * 2 * 1  right  So when you expand it out.  You got an cubed minus. What is it 3 and squared + 2 N / 6  So cancel out all the coefficients cancel out all the lower terms and what are you left with is?  Big Theta of n cubed and so it's not and Cubed is not Big O of N squared. So this is false.  A what?  Was that was there another question, sorry.  Yeah, and choose three is big state of n cubed, which means that.  Then it would be big state of N squared.  Right because it just end * N - 1 / 2.  It's actually going to come into play when we start talking about.  Graphs and algorithms and things like that. That one comes up a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I already took that into consideration because it's an factorial / N - 3 factorial so that means all the factors and -3 and last what will cancel out.  You're just left with three terms in the numerator.  What is that?  the white ones are  Will always be the fastest they're not faster than end to the end.  Okay.  All right. Let's look at this. Last one. This one is where FN is the Fibonacci numbers.  Okay, so  Fibonacci numbers and the best way to deal with them is by using the recursive definition. What goes well what kind of proof technique goes well with recursion induction queso this one if you have something like this, then you're going to need to use induction to prove it. Can I so let's do that.  Okay prove.  FN  Is Big O of two to the end in order to do one of these proof by induction you first need to make a claim? Okay, you need to make a claim about a c and a k k. This one's easy because it turns out that to the end is always bigger than Fibonacci numbers. And I'm using the the Fibonacci numbers were F 0 is 1 in F1 is one and then at the end is equal to F. + -1 + 1/2 + -2.  Okay, so claim.  A fan is less than or equal to 2 to the end.  For all n greater than or equal to 0 that claim then I've proven that FN is bigger love to the end, but it's always nice to put the claim out there first. So I know what you're doing.  Okay.  bass cases  Apple of 0 is 1220 is 1 verified.  F1 is 1/2 to the one is to verified.  inductive hypothesis  assume  that  for some k  greater than  What's a greater than strictly greater than 1?  FJ  Is less than or equal to 2 to the J?  For all Jay such that Jay is in between 0 and strictly less than K K strong inductive hypothesis. I'm basically saying that it's true for all the values in between 0 and K and I want to show that it's true 4K.  true 4K  IE show  F K is less than or equal to 2 K.  So you can't just use what you there's sort of a way around it by using the regular induction, but you just have to make a few more assumptions.  For the reason I'm using strong induction is because the Fibonacci numbers go back to steps.  If you have a recursion that only goes back one step then you want to just use regular induction. But since it goes back more than one step I'm using strong induction.  Gangstar then here's the inductive set.  F K is equal to F K - 1 + f k - 2  Which is less than or equal to 2 to the K - 1 + 2 to the K - 2  Which is strictly less than 2 to the K - 1 + 2 to the K - 1 night. So this song is got to be less than that.  equal to 2 to the k  got any questions  yeah, the strong induction came from  this inequality cuz I got this guy is less than or equal to this guy and this guy is less than or equal to that guy. And so I was able to  I was able to say that the song F K - 1 + f k - 2 is less than or equal to the sum of those two powers of two. That was a strong induction.  Turn in order to do big data. You have to do both directions.  Good question is FN big Omega of to the end.  was not  so a fan.  It actually like grows. It's so F. And is Big Theta of something like 1.6 to the end? So it's like it's still exponential but it's not quite as fast as to the end.  That's just if you're curious.  Okay any other questions about this?  All right, let's go. Let's move on to a few more exercises.  If F of an over G of N2 limit is 20 then what can what can we say is true?  That ass is big ol G that app is Big Omega of g f is Big fader of G or all of them or two of them, but not the other.  Okay good. So most everybody is saying all of them. So the people that are saying two of them.  It's actually impossible to just have two of them.  Okay, because if you have big O and big Omega that implies big stator and if you ever have big say that as one of them that implies the other two, so get this weird thing.  questions about that  Yeah, that's right. Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Okay, so just think about this a little bit before we move on SN is basically growing around 20 times faster than GN right there for their growing not at the same rate, but kind of like quote on quote at the same rate because it's an integer. It's different by integer mold.  Okay, how about this one?  African over giovan is 0 then what is true notice that these set inclusions are all negated.  Okay, so what can we conclude from the fact that a van over G of n is equal to 0 with a limit?  Okay, it's a lot of you guys are saying two of the above.  Which two?  BNC Bank  Okay, let's go. Let's talk about it for a sec before we move on.  So over Giovanni equals 0 that implies f is Big O of G right, but if we go back to that list of limit rules, you'll see that for Theda the limit has to be some nonzero constant and for Omega the limit has to also be some nonzero constant for Infinity. It's on both cases. It's not the case right song.  Any questions about that?  Okay good.  So the last will exercise I want to do is to  talk about these three families.  so  The functions in the family Big O of n cubed. What do we have?  And squared what else do we see earlier that was in this family?  And she's three, right?  And choose to choose one and choose 0, right?  And plus and squared and so on. How about a big state of n cubed?  and Cubed  entrance three, right?  5 in cubed + 2 + squared + + login + log base of + and  / log base 2 of n + and square root in  Okay, what functions are in the family big Omega, so we have we have all of our favorites here. What else is in here?  And she was four.  and shoes  Huh?  until the end of God  N factorial to to the end. What about 3 to end?  AKA  9 to the end  did I make a mistake last time? That's what I meant.  Oh, I made a mistake.  27  how about the 27?  How about 10?  cubed log base 3 of n  i one more picture. I want to draw you all.  So you can think about these things kind of edges Venn diagrams, right?  And I'm thinking about them going all the way back and all the way forward right because this is big and here, right?  Legos and Cubed this is going to be big Omega of n cubed and this will be big data of n cubed is that grows slower and slower and slower and this Omega contains all the functions that grow huge. So it's sort of like on an open-ended each end. But really the end cubed is the one that's more tight.  Okay. Well, I'll see you guys next Monday.  No.  You got to put it into the closed form.  Because that's really what it is right now.  Can I talk to your tutor about how to how to be a tutor? Oh, yeah. So here's breining and Fook these guys. Hey guys wants to talk to you all for a second.  Yes.  Thank you.  But that's because it's it's big state of like this 1.6 to the end.  Now you can just write out what they are. Yeah, you can just write them like that. That's fine.  If I just reduce them to like these and then just went straight to the big city. That's good.  So I think I mentioned to you that I had fun.
