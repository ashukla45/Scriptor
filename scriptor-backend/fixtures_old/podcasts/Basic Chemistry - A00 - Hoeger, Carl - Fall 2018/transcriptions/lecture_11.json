First of all, three of you three people in his class are looks like cheated on the test 3K that doesn't happen to my classes. And if you got an email from me saying you need to see me you need to bed my office as fast as you can because the next email you will get will be from the dean saying you need to report to the Dean's office for academic Integrity violations. Okay, there were three people to people that the TA saw looking at each other's exam during the turn in one person one guy went and sat back down the right changes answer.  What We Know Who You Are  only reason we haven't gone after you yet is because we're waiting to look at exam to start comparing them. So some of you are going to get this email if you cheat in my class. I will ruin your life.  And I'm not kidding you.  You have no idea what kind of things I could do to you. Okay?  You want to hear Horror Story is off podcast.  and not only that I'll turn you into everybody that you ever take a class from UCSD again, so don't do it and some of you in and there's at least two that are going to have their  Body parts in a in a slam overall and now having said that about the three people. Let me see this about the rest of you. The rest of you were fantastic. You did a great job you were you did everything you were told only one person didn't put their sequence number on the test, which basically cost the entire class by bonus points, but  One person one person usually put he's like if it's if everyone in the class can follow all instructions. A lot of people didn't put one's for a raise, but I can understand it one person didn't write the sequence number on a test in bubble idiom.  So anyway, I know out that person this time, but they do it again.  I have a Facebook page called dumb. Nevermind. Alright, alright, the bottom line is you guys did a great job. You did good. You did everything you're supposed to its. I know it's stressful first exams are stressful. It is something to get used to chemistry exams at UCSD can be especially in class exams or brutal. They're just brutal after this lot of the example. Sorry after Kim for a lot of the exam that you take in in chemistry will be on Saturdays and they usually are much less stressful. Mostly because there's more you have two hours. There's more time to get you seated. It just it just works better, but overall. I was very happy with how you guys did with the exception of the few people that we had to yell at.  Be sure to keep up with the homework. There was the by the way that the guy who they were two people. There was one guy in here. Do you have a calculator? He was up front. This guy called out my apologize to him. He was in the wrong room. You should have been taking a Kim 4tb exam. So he was in the wrong the wrong room. There was also a Kim 4tb exam person who took almost the entire test before you realized. It wasn't him 40 dk40 Kim 40 am-4pm 4K convert pounds.  ounces convert pounds to grams chem 40b  That's what you doing Kim for TD. He didn't see any of those. I don't want to protest.  We finally got on Emerson wrong class. They left.  I mean, how do you get into UCSD?  All right.  Please keep up with the homework. Now. I understand I end and the end of the one guy who didn't have a calculator which also makes complete sense why you have a calculator supposed to have a calculator in organic, but he also said to me also came we were talking after the exam came back and I use that student of mine. Came back after class and we were talking about it and he said well the professor who is giving the 40 B exam wasn't there that wasn't going to be there that day so he thought he goes all but he knew me and he was always probably subbing for him cuz he knows I eat organic makes complete sense. However, I think they both were in the wrong roommate. I think we're some communication there, but at least he figured it out when you look at the exam and realized it was Kim for not 40. Be sure to keep up with your homework.  There will be a relatively important announcement as possible on Triton did this weekend? You'll see it either sometime between sometime between tonight and Saturday afternoon. It's something that it's something that either is going to happen or not going to happen. And if you see a need if you see something that says never mind and you'll understand that it didn't happen.  One more one more thing. I am going to put up. I am going to put up clicker points to Door attendance points today. It's not running right now. So you'll see why in a minute video to date there have been some issues as far as that goes but not not on your end, but mostly on a transfer files and which I have I think I fixed this morning, but the other one has to do with tutors.  And tutors and Friends helping you outside of on assignment that you turn in with your name for great. It is a new all people should seen this this email that went out. It was it's an announcement on Ted. It is a violation of academic Integrity to turn in anything that's cheating by the way to turn in anything with your name on it. Somebody else did for credit. It's and if we find we catch it you are going to academic prison now in on Labs now, this is where it gets a little bit gets a little iffy on Labs. We know that some of you go and talk to the tutors about how to do some of your tutors that that that help you with the problems. That's fine.  You just cannot it put their work down. Okay. Now one of the saddest things is someone did some work showed it to the tutor and ask them to check it for it was it was correct. The tutor looked at it and said it wasn't told them how to change it and they changed it to the wrong answer. Okay. What does that tell you about tutors? They don't always know what they're talking about. And especially they don't know what they're talkin about. Sometimes when you're showing them a camphor problem where there's a certain amount of information. We know you don't have so we don't expect a complete for answer on these things. We expect 8 weeks at the best that you can get out of it. Okay. It is better on labs in particular post lab questions to do your own work to put down what you think the answer is using your rationale.  time  If you lose points on a question.  On a post lab question or something like that in the overall scheme of things in a lab, for example, the overall point totals in his class doesn't mean anything. It's almost nothing. That's why we make allowances for the fact that a lot of the questions. We know you're going to struggle with we know you're going to struggle with them now because later on you won't that's the goal goal is to learn by doing not to learn by having somebody tell you how to do it. Okay, you could always go to a TA you can always go to me you can go to a two door. But the way to do it is to say I don't know how to do this type of problem. Can you give me an example of how of how to go about it? That's fine. In fact, that's what you should be doing because it doesn't do you any good for them to do the problem for you and then to find out on an exam. You don't know how to do it and that will happen and it will happen.  more than you want to know about so the bottom line is when you're using tutors when using the tutoring service here when you're using friends to help you friends are like the worst Hooters on Earth just  always  always the sniff test should be your own in other words. If you think you did the problem, right then turn it in have the guts to turn it in and if you get it wrong.  Learn from the mistake and that's the only way you weren't science does not get done because people get the answers correct all the time science gets done because of Errors because people make mistakes because people do things wrong, they learn from it and they improve on it and that's the idea and Kim for that's a big part of what I want. You're what you're going to be going through and because of that I just want to make sure that you understand this this business because it's it's it's more important. I think then a lot of you really realize okay, let me get this thing going here.  And then we will.  I held this one for you. Why are you holding this one for me?  Sorry, my computer is talking to me. I don't know why.  Okay, so let's go over to this source.  PGA  here is the question. What is the oxidation state of sulfur of sulfur in sulfate?  This is the same way you figure out by the way, cuz you don't remember. This is the way you figure out. What is the what is the charge on the iron and iron three chloride things like that. You do the same way.  oxidation state of sulfur not the charge of Sulfate  k  Last chances to get this one, right?  What's up?  and this  I always love this part.  Correct. Answer is  G  chewy  show you  Again, this is something that you want.  Need to make sure that you know how to work how to do at least at some point in time there. I've done it sulfur we don't know what sulfur is that sack oxygen is mine is two or four of those total is equal to mine is too. So that's x - 8 is equal to mine is too that means X must be equal to plus 6 get an oxidation state is something that will talk about in more detail. But this is done as I said before the same way you do you determine the charge like iron 3 plus in stop by the way the nomenclature you're going to have some nomenclature thing part of the announcement on the weekends going to have to do with that as well that's coming up soon.  So make sure you know how to do this is just it's it's one of those sorts of things that we want to learn because eventually and this is going to come up in not this next week. The experiment you're doing on Friday, but the next experiment you do where we looking all different types of reactions is where you're going to actually start to see this in much more in much more detail. So let me do this. So now  If you click it now and you already clicked in before you'll get double attendance for the day.  Yeah.  You can cook it now.  It's cuz I turned it off after the question. Okay, let's go. We were doing in our module this we were doing serial dilution dilutions of stock solution and I had given you this kind of at this sort of the way to do this thing that I posted over there. I posted the other day this which is exactly the same thing. This is cuz this is what we're doing in terms of a serial dilution. What we're doing is we're taking our stock solution. We took to Mel out of that. We calculated the moles that were removed then we deluded that the 300 Mills. That's our first solution. That would be rc2 if you will and then we took five meals out of that. We calculated the moles that remove their we deluded it to 500 meals that gives us our final solution.  And so by looking at the by going through this like this, here's what I hear is the actual math. Can you most of you have seen this stuff before and what you notice that this does and it's just becomes very simple math at this point in time again, the most important thing you can do when you start a problem like this is to classify your variables. Is that what's what do you know? Okay. I know the initial concentration. I know the initial amount, I remove etc. Etc. Just make sure you classify those and then from there you do the calculation and notice it what you been able to do in this delusion is you been able to take a solution that was quote relatively concentrated. Concentrated relatively so and diluted out to a very very dilute 10 to the -5 more moles per liter of this Solution. That's one of the things that dilution allows you to do.  Solution allows you to make up a convenient concentration Solution One were you can actually weigh out the amount of material easily and then dilute that give you a very dilute solution that maybe is more likely what you're going to use in an experiment that is exactly how drugs Pharmaceuticals are done. They make Pharmaceuticals where they are the pure compound for example something, you know, like Emily panel opening where you make the cop as a pure chemical and then they do a series of dilutions on it to get it to the string that it needs to be to treat whatever disease you happen to have whatever condition it happens to be treating treating. So these delusions are important. Now there's another thing that comes out of all of this and I'm going to put this back on this slide here.  That's the idea of what's called people have asked me this for called a back.  calculation  and back calculation  it all the calculations you seen here a calculation goes from a concentrated solution to a dilute solution in a back calculation. There's nothing different going on except the in a back calculation the initial.  Concentration is dilute.  nhu back calculate  to give the  concentrated solution  molarity, that's all that's going on in the back calculation about calculation. You say all right, after all the dilutions. This is what I have. Okay, and then what you're going to do is you going to say all right. What was the concentration of the solution that I originally got it from?  So another words C initial is the dilute solution C. Final is the concentrated solution. So that's what that calculation means that calculation meme. You take your final result and you work your way backwards to figure out what was originally you started with. And by the way, this is a very useful technique for a lot of different things the best way to learn Chemistry, by the way is when you do a chemical problem, is it the very end back calculate their start with the answer you got and make sure you can get back to where you came from because if you can do that if you can understand how to do a problem forwards and backwards you could do a problem. You could do almost any problem that I could throw at you I'm on an exam. So I just want to make sure that we're at we're on the same page as far as that kind of stuff goes.  Okay, so  I'm again there to share dilution. Is that the last the last concentration property? I want to talk about and I'm going to mention this very quickly cuz we won't use it much in here if we use it at all and that is molality. Now, I will at one point of time. I asked you to calculate the molality of something just to see if you just to have you do it but it is infrequently used now that's not really true. It is used in specific circumstances that we don't use in here. Okay. It is mostly seen in something known as colligative properties and it's mostly no seen in physical chemistry. Was it you or Kim Majors? You learn about physical chemistry in in gory detail.  Colligative properties are the properties that make a solution a solution. In other words are solution properties are the properties of a bulk solution. We don't talk much about those we used to do experiments a couple experiments involved at but we should have cut them out because colligative Properties or something that you talked about in in 6B, they're important but not as important as other things that we want to talk about. It is used because of the units of molality normality is indicated as a lowercase M. It is by definition the moles of solute divided by kilograms of solvent not solution solvent.  Because it is mass over, Mass.  Cuz it's Mass over Mass. It is not temperature dependent which is why it is used in physical chemistry. And why does using colligative property and physical chemistry almost everything you discuss has some temperature dependence and colligative properties everything you discuss has a temperature dependence as well.  Because it's temperature independent we can use it at different temperatures other than room temperature without having to worry about what's going on with the solvent. In other words is the solution or the salt or is that a volume site without having to worry about the volume is the volume changing with temperature because volumes do change with temperature.  What are the most important things that come out of all of this again? This is something it's going to come up more in is 6B than anywhere else and that is that for dilute Solutions.  at4 dilute Solutions  The molarity of the solution is approximately equal to the molality and when I say less than 1 molar its commits exactly true. It's almost completely true.  4 less than or equal to 0.1 molar.  Most of you haven't understood don't really understand why I won't understand until I tell you this next thing about why why we're so interested in studying dilute solutions to start with and the answer to that is has to do with something on his ideology.  dilute Solutions tend to behave ideally  in an ideal solution  is one where there is no.  outside influence  due to the species present in the solution, in other words the cations behave independently broad tense and purposes from the entrance that's important because as Solutions become more and more concentrated  They become more and more unpredictable as to what they'll do. For example.  In a room full of 10 people. It's very easy to predict what people will do.  in a room of 300 people or  202  it's less predictable again. One of the reasons for that has to do with the fact that all of a sudden there's interactions friends talking about talking with friends people under computers in the back looking up plane games.  Looking at lingerie, which actually I saw once.  I was still in the back of the room sometimes in other classes and I look to see what's going on and you'll see 50 computers open on 50 different website one time. There was a boyfriend and a girlfriend. I assume looking at lingerie for her.  I know is lingerie because I know what it looks like. Okay, another guy in the back sitting that back corner up. There was playing Battlefield 1942 during a professor's class. And the thing is the professor should have seen it cuz you guys were like this the whole time tonight.  Find me.  But the bottom line is it's unpredictable as as the solution as the room becomes more concentrated more people becomes more unpredictable dilute Solutions are predictable and because of that we can learn more about chemical properties that way but again, these are kinds of things that you learn as you go on. This is by the way why we deal with dilute Solutions dilute Solutions are much easier. In fact the blue food coloring experiment.  If you want to know why we want you to make the solution so dilute why you had to make dilute the grape solution out other than the instruments don't we did very well is it as soon as you start to get the more concentrated solution Beer's Law that thing I was talking about in an experiment. Beer's Law stops working like it does beers while works exactly for dilute solution does not work as well for concentrated Solutions. And so again, there's a lot of things in chemistry we know  That are more important to understand.  Understand what happens in a dilute solution in a be able to take it to a concentrated solution for those of you and I don't think you're ever going to see me in a general chemistry class unless you take it unless you take something during the the summer.  In chemistry in or general chemistry in particular one of my sayings when things I tell classes all the time is chemistry is about basements and ceilings science in general is about basements and ceilings. People are want to know what that means and the answer to that is  a lot of times to get an exact answer  Is difficult but would isn't as difficult sometimes is the figure out what the lowest possible answer you could get is or the highest possible answer your other words in chemistry and Science in general, but in chemistry, it's important to know.  What the lowest possible number of the lowest possible value for something could be and or the highest value because if you know what the lowest value is in the actual value has to be above that. If you know what the highest value is. The actual value has to be below that so it allows us to put limits on what we're talking about and a lot of times the limits are more important than the actual number they tell us more about what's going on dilute Solutions. A lot of times allow us to get those basements and ceilings. So what we're going to do now, we're going to talk about and limiting reagent. I do Autumn you're going to do tomorrow as to do with limiting reagents and I'm going to say a couple things to get you sort of of of prepped up for that so to speak  and first introductory comments  is that this is one of the real important topics that we talked about and Kim for it is one of  it's It's the topic that when you get out of camp or you will know the best out of the nomenclature. I think you'll know this the best because it's the one with a harp on a lot after we finish this topic after you finished, treat a lot of the stuff we do from here on out even though it's based on Stoichiometry is more sort of getting you ready for some of the more esoteric things in the 6-series, but this is really important we get that we do this to major emphasis on exams to major emphasis in Labs. You've already done an experiment on Stoichiometry. You've done the empirical formula experiment now, we're going to look at at the Swanky armor treat with in chemical equations to be able to do stoichiometry. You have to be a correct chemical formula that you should be able to do now, but you supposed to know nomenclature.  Order and where the oranges form from and you need to be able to balance a chemical equation or have a balanced chemical equation now, we're going to talk about balancing Chemical Equations after we finished or geometry. Okay, so you should be able to do number one. But the balancing of chemical equations is county is done in the next module in till then I'm going to give you the balanced chemical equation. Okay, and that's what you're going to work with after that. It's going to be up to you to didn't sure that the equations are balanced now on exams.  On exams if an equation is unbalanced. I will tell you it'll say unbalanced behind it in parentheses. Usually okay, or I'll say in the question this equation is unbalanced. Okay. Otherwise the equations that I will give you and in this section equations. I'll give you our balance and if you're not told whether it's bounced or not on an exam check it but almost always it will be balanced. I will buy my usually will be completely aware of all of this and let you know this equation is unbalanced. You need to balance it. Okay, so keep that in mind so when we talk about  Stoichiometry, what is stoichiometry geometry comes from the two words words for element and measuring is a $0.75 word?  That is read that talks about the science of measuring the quantity two proportions or mass ratios, which chemical element stand one another other words. It is a horrible recipe for doing a chemical reaction. It deals with calculations about the masses moles volumes of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. It's the counting of chemistry. It's how we find out it's how we will determine then if I wanted to make 8 grams of silver chloride how much silver nitrate would I have to start with how much lead chloride or how much sodium chloride would I have to start with in other words? It's it is the it is a recipe for all intents and purposes and we're going to use that recipe to figure out how much product we made.  How much starting material we need to make a certain amount of product etc. Etc. K most Stoichiometry properties, but I promise that you that they're presented to you. You're going to be given a certain amount of reactant or reactants and then add then ask how much of a product can be formed or we're going to give you a desired quantity of a product and say how much starting materials do you need to make that it can be done. So what we're going to do was we're going to start from either side of the equation to come get this sort of information now until that time this is what I call my chemical in her in my chemical quantity inter conversion chart and you notice  By the way, this is it. This is a slide. You should print out and keep around with you. What this does is it indicates something very important. And that first thing is the to be able to do stoichiometry. We must have moles and what moles of compounds do in a balanced chemical equation is the moles allow us to take two different compounds.  It might or might not have something in common with one another and connect them to each other.  because in all Stoichiometry problems  We need to know the moles of either A or B.  To be able to do the calculations for the moles whatever else we have to be looking at. So everything goes through the mole know, how do we get to the mall? That's what's on that's what's on this slide all the different ways. We can get the moles. We can take the volume of a solution we can use the molarity to get the moles. We can take the grams of something we can use the molar mass to get the moles. We can take the volume of a gas to get to moles of a gas. We can take atoms or molecules. We can take a volume of a gas or liquid etcetera Etc. So this set of conversions is what beats at the heart of all of this and will use all so typically the way a problem is going to be given to you is something along these kinds of lines where you will be given the grams of something.  You will have to go up to moles. You'll have to go from moles and animals of bee and then from there you might be asked to get the grams of be but beating it all of this is this thing called the store Q metric relationship in the story key metric relationship is what's in the chemical equation. Again. This is a smaller table of the showing one of the more important one that we're talking about this point which the grams to moles and then moles to grams or whatever else we happen to be looking at okay.  So the reaction Stoichiometry now before I go on here, let me say Let me say something else as far as this kind of stuff goes and I'll do this. I could kiss the where chemical reaction is written is it's written as  reactants react at 1  Plus reactant 2. Plus that the. Whatever  Goes to that's what the arrow means.  products one  best products to plus whatever, okay.  Typical chemical reaction looks like this now.  the reactants and the products  Are typically chemicals, but they can also be things like heat. For example, we can have this.  plus Heat  goes to give something we can have this to give something.  Plus heat plus whatever so heat can also be a starting material or a product when heat is a starting material.  We call those reactions.  endo  thermic  when heat  is a product.  We call those XO.  thermic XO meaning out heat is given out and no meaning he is taking in Okay, so  You want to share with the rest of us?  Next time you can come up here and you can tell everybody.  The reaction you're doing on Friday is exothermic heat is given off and you're going to measure the heat in directly.  By measuring the temperature change. Okay, so heat is not only a starting material but can be a product. And for those of you don't really understand this think about this if you were to have a bonfire.  The amount of heat that you could get off on that bonfires a direct function of how many pounds are burning.  The more pallets more heat the fire gives off.  And that is exactly what we're talking about. The amount of heat is limited by what you're burning how much if it's your Bernie the amount of heat that you can be able to get off on the reaction on Friday is a function of how much starting materials in there in particular of one of the two which is something I hopefully will get you here in just a little bit. So going back to all of this. This is what the story came after gray. She was all about. So we have a chemical equation shown at the bottom the Stoichiometry ratio are the coefficients that live in front of each of the starting materials and products in the balanced chemical equation.  If a number is not explicitly shown and is understood to be one so down here in this story key metric ratio for the problem that you've seen here. This is a this is a process known as the harbor process this tells us that  free malls  of Age 2  require  one mole  of N2  to make to moles  of NH3 by the way, we could do molecules as well. Which means this that the ratio  of moles of H2  2 moles of N2  is 3 to 1.  or one more  of N2 for every 3 moles  of H2  or we could say that we get to moles.  of NH3 for every 3 moles  of Age 2  number words those whose coefficients allow us to connect every starting material with every product and vice versa. That's what we have to use don't understand that if you don't have a balanced chemical equation all the calculations in the world that you do are going to tell you nothing.  Heat is a product or reactant is what I was just talking about.  If your module be something will do toward later on in the course of chemical reactions quite often either require heat to occur endothermic reactions, okay, or give off heat when they occur exothermic reaction cooking is an endothermic reaction changing the meat cooking the meat changing the proteins in they're two they're cooked form requires heat exothermic reactions reactions that give off heat like mixing two chemicals like you going to do on Friday, they give off heat. That's an example of an of an exothermic thing is you cannot tell whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic until you know more about it or actually do it. Okay.  In an endothermic reaction heat can be considered a starting material in an exothermic reaction heat is considered to be a product. You're going to be doing an exothermic one.  So everything we say with respect to Stoichiometry can it be applied to heat or energy in general? In other words? It's not just chemicals that have squeaky metric relationships.  It is also energy.  Energy has a very tight connection with all chemical reactions. Okay.  This means the amount of heat you can get from a reaction.  Or the amount of heat you needed to go to get it to go is a direct function of the amounts of starting materials you have or the amount of products you wish to make finally while he itself is difficult to measure temperature is not and heat is directly proportional to the change in temperature, which is why we can use temperature to measure heat what you don't know is what the exact relationship between heat and temperature is that is something we'll talk about in intro module B, but you don't need to know that at this point in time. All you need to know is that heat and temperature are directly related to one another there for measuring the amount of temperature.  The changes gives us a measure of how much heat has been given off.  So what do we need to do to do stoichiometry calculations first? We need to write and balance the chemical equation again going to be given balance chemical equations. But once you are not something you always need to check finally second. You need to calculate the molar masses of any materials for what you've been given amount or we'll have to determine amounts for you don't have to calculate the molar mass of everything that's in your chemical equation, but you do need to do it for anything for which you are given gram amounts or for what you need Graham out again, you must make sure that your calculation of the molar mass is correct if it's not  The rest of what you do is going to be a problem you convert any masses that are given to moles you're going to use the balanced chemical equation to determine the story key metric ratios calculate the moles of desired material, and then finally if required calculate the grams of desired material or whatever else you need to calculate.  But notice in all this we need to get to moles as the first calculation that you need to do. By the way. This is why molarity is so nice because the molarity we don't when you have moles per liter you don't need to calculate molar mass is right off the bat cuz they're already Incorporated in the in the whole in the situation.  chowder start by doing an example  and I always apologize if I ever am not going to apologize to you guys for this. But if I was teaching chem 6A, you would see this exact same set of slides. And the reason is because 6B campsite as we do it in six p is because while you guys are going to learn how to do it now, you're going to see it again in 6B  and  It's important enough that it is worth going over twice. Even if you understand it. It's a good ideas to keep an idea to keep your eyes open on this. So here I'm going to say if a solution contains 14.7 G of silver nitrate and it's treated with a solution of sodium phosphate how much silver phosphate will be made now here is an example of a typical kind of problems in our exam you are given names of compounds but no chemical formulas. You are given the names of the chemical compounds, but not given a balanced chemical equation either.  So here first thing you have to do is write the correct chemical formulas. And if you get that part wrong, the whole problems wrong, after that. The second thing you need to do is balance the chemical equation on this case. I've done this before you sodium phosphate is na3 po4.  3 silver nitrates or Star silver nitrate is agno3. It goes to give silver phosphate ag3p 04 + sodium nitrate.  Nano3 noticed that would the balanced equation. We have one in front of the sodium phosphate. We have a 3 in front of the silver nitrate that gives us one sodium silver phosphate and three sodium nitrates that balances it out. The other thing in this equation is something we'll talk about later on a q  versus  this one which is an S4 solid that is not something that you're going to learn about until the next experiment you do after the one on Friday and we talked about it. We talked about the solubility rules. Okay, A Q means in solution dissolved in solution. It means the Lions operate independently of one another.  AQ means in solution means the ions into our operating independently of one another a solid means it is insoluble in solution. It means the ions stick together.  K A Q is like you  And your friend going to a party?  Looking to meet someone.  S is you and your friend going to a party when you're not looking for someone?  Okay, you're married or almost? Okay, if you're going to a party looking for to meet people and you're married, then that's just  it just dude. All right.  So independent operation of the irons is what we see with a Q when there was solid or not going to separate means are also in soluble in the water. So let's look and see what we've done here while calculate the molar mass for silver nitrate the molar mass for silver nitrate 160. Not one 168.94 silver phosphate for 15.7.  You notice for the grams of the sodium phosphate. I have the word excess. They're the reason I put excess in is because if you are not given the amount of a starting material.  You are to assume unless you're supposed to calculate it. You are to assume that you have more than enough of it. That is what's called the reagent in excess it is the reagent of which the starting material which you have more of anything else.  The starting material for which you are given the amount.  Is the limiting reagent it is the one that limits how much product you can make?  If the first starting material is in excess and the second one is limiting. It means that the amount of product that you can make is directly a function.  How much the limiting starting material the limiting reagent allows you to make?  If I can work, so if I'm starting with 14.7 grams of silver nitrate and I may I convert that to moles that's 0.087 on moles.  Again, at this point in time. I'm not worrying about significant figures because I'm just doing my calculations at this point. I'm sig figs or something to worry about later on.  In the beginning of a reaction, there was no silver phosphate formed. There's no silver phosphate in there when you mix the two reagent we start mixing things which means you have zero of that the start you have 0 moles of it there for  By definition of limiting reagent is exactly that it limits how much product you can you can make but there's also another assumption we make and the assumption is that the end of the reaction the limiting reagent is completely gone.  At the end of the reaction limiting reagent is completely gone.  Now you will find out later on in chem 6B. This is not exactly true.  But that's when we have to talk about something on equilibrium. We're not going to worry about that at this point in time. So it means it at the end of the reaction. We have 0 moles and 0 grams of silver nitrate left because it's the starting material. It's limiting how much we make the question is given that how much product can we make that's what we're going to calculate notice it down here. I have the double asterisks over excess the double asterisk means  Dr. Weil, so the double asterisk means that will be less.  Then I have to start.  No words. Some of the excess reagent is going to be used up, but they're still going to be excess reagent left. Okay, so doing that.  Here is our chemical equation. Let's go through and do it 14.7 grams of silver nitrate * 1 mol of silver nitrate for everyone. 68.9 grams tells me that I have .08 7 on moles of silver nitrate. Now when I'm going to use is my stoicheia metric ratio.  Okay, my story key metric ratio my story key metric ratio coming.  From here and here the one is understood.  Rainbow one mole of silver phosphate for every 3 moles of silver nitrate again going through a dimensional analysis the moles of silver nitrate wrong thing moles of silver nitrate cancels moles of silver nitrate. So I am left with moles of sodium phosphate. I now do the math.  .08 700 * 1 / 3 is 02900 moles of silver phosphate this  Is the maximum?  I'm out.  a can  Be made.  from the silver nitrate  present  that's what a limiting reagent does.  If I then asked for engrams, I take the moles of the silver phosphate * the molar mass of silver phosphate again moles of silver phosphate.  again, if we do this the moles of silver phosphate canceled moles of silver phosphate that gives me grams and that and that initial 14.7 G of silver nitrate gave me or will give me  12.1 G of silver phosphate this by the way is also something that we call.  the theoretical  Yield.  The theoretical yield is the amount of product that we could theoretically make.  The amount of product we could theoretically make okay. It's like following a cookie dough is like following a recipe for making cookies.  Theoretically you can make a dozen. Okay, do you ever really make a dozen? Well, not if you're eating the cookie dough not if you drop it on the ground, hopefully.  Okay. If you make your cookies bigger than a recipe says.  So theoretical yield is just that the theoretical amount of the material the product that you could make the actual yield is something we'll talk about it later on.  so  That's very straightforward k.  So here are four examples another strike a metric calculation. Now, what I'm doing is I'm going to ask the question what if I needed to prepare 25 grams of silver phosphate. What is the minimum amount of sodium phosphate needed to accomplish this giving you have an excess of silver nitrate. So now what I'm doing is I'm turning this question around to say, alright, this is how much this is how much silver on Silver phosphate I need I need to make  I have an excess of silver nitrate because there's a lot of it around the laboratory. How much sodium phosphate do I need? This is actually very common calculation in a chemical lab or in an experimental lab when you need to make something or for example, when you when one of your starting materials is much more expensive than the other one. Okay. So here I'm going to go back and use this again again. Now the sodium phosphate has a molar mass of 163.9 again, we know what the silver phosphate is. I take 25 G of silver phosphate. I convert that to moles of silver phosphate again. We've done this we've done this.  Before grams Castle grab that gives me moles of silver phosphate. So 25 grams of silver phosphate is 06001 moles. I then use the Stoichiometry ratio again, here is my story geometric ratio with a story key metric ratio.  Is 1 silver phosphate 1 sodium phosphate for 1 silver phosphate. So that means that that I'm going to need .00 601 moles of sodium phosphate. I then convert that to grams so I can go into the laboratory to pick up how much of it I need and when I do that again using dimensional analysis is why we teach dimensional analysis, by the way, I'm using a dimensional analysis. We find that the moles of sodium phosphate moles of sodium phosphate. Give me an answer that's in grams of sodium phosphate.  When I simply do here's a Moto X the molar mass right grams per mole means that I need to start with 9.86 grams of silver phosphate again couches nothing. There's nothing magic going on. There's nothing strange going on since all stuff that you really do believe it or not really do know how to do.  No.  Again, I've shown you the two most common calculations starting material going to product or product. I'm a starting material. Do I need now? Let's do the next part of this in the next part of it is the idea of the limiting reagent and what if we don't know which of the starting materials is limiting what if we're given amounts for both of the starting materials, okay?  Typically when we run a chemical reaction, it's carried out such that was in such a way that one of the starting materials is present in a smaller Stoichiometry come out.  And the others in other words, what are the two starting materials is going to limit how much product we can make sometimes it's because it's expensive sometimes because it's rare sometimes because it you just don't have enough of it. Okay. This is the limiting reagent. The limiting reagent is called the limiting reagent because it limits the amount of product you can form.  It's based whether something's a limiting reagent or not is based on the molar amount given and the story key metric amounts needed.  Okay, limiting reagent problems are very easy to spot. You know, it's a limiting reagent problem.  If you're given amounts of more than one of the starting materials anytime you are given more and anytime you are given the amounts of more than one of the starting materials. The first thing you need to do is figure out which of the two is the limiting reagent which of the two going to limit how much products you can make, okay?  Precaution all of this is the limiting reagent must be determined by calculation.  If all of the coefficients are one.  It's easy.  But what if the coefficients aren't one, then you have to make sure you do the calculation because the gram or the molar amounts may lead you to an incorrect answer unless you do the calculation.  How do we do limiting reagent calculations? We carry out the first three steps as outlined for the standards to a key metric calculation. And then what we do is once we figure it out how many moles of each of the starting materials we have we are then going to use one of three methods to determine determine limiting reagent need versus have  The product method which is my favorite of them because it's really hard to screw that one up and the ratio method which I'm not going to tell you how to do and it's not recommended that you do it. Did you use it until you master limiting reagent now sometimes in Oasis sometimes tutors will teach you this this ratio method unless you absolutely understand what's going on.  Don't use it. Okay now in the very beginning until you're absolutely sure, you know how to do limiting reagent problems and you do not screw them up.  I would do them by two methods every time.  Do need versus have check it with the product method do the product method check it with me versus have eventually you are going to find one of the methods is going to be the one that you're the most comfortable using at that point in time could avoid you don't have to don't use the other methods for homework on exams. You don't have time to try more than one. So by that time you're going to need to know how to do it. Now. The good news is after doing about five or six limiting reagent problems. You'll be completely versed in it and you won't have these kinds of problems anymore. The rest of the cow. The rest of the calculation is done the same way as well as we did before once we know what the limiting reagent is. We use that to do the rest of the calculations.  Two methods that I'm going to teach you. Let's talk about the first one need versus have the need versus have is based on knowing how much of a given the given starting a picture of you have and comparing it to how much you need. Okay, the way you do this is you start with one of your starting materials calculate how much of the other starting material you need to completely react with it.  Make sure you use the strike e metric ratios from your balanced chemical equation you compare the amount needed for the starting material to to the amount you actually have.  If need is greater than have another words if you need more than you have starting material to is your limiting reagent if you have more of starting material to than you need the starting material one is your limiting reagent.  Finish all study striking metric calculations based on your limiting reagent and we'll go through the calculation of each of these so you see it first-hand.  The second method which is the product method the product method does not involve any of this need versus have calculations. The product method is a Brute Force way of doing it and it goes like this you take starting material one calculate how much product you can make from that you take starting material to calculate how much product you can make from that?  The starting material that makes the smallest amount of product is your limiting reagent.  And you can make the comparison and moles. You don't need to go to grams until the very end.  How much product you pick one product is matter which one you pick how much product in starting material 1 make how much product and starting material to make?  The one that makes the smallest amount of product is your limiting reagent. Okay, so let's do need versus have  And again, I'm going to use the same the same basic while prom I did before and then we'll do the product method next time. So again this time what if I say I started with 14.7 grams of silver nitrate, but I also started with 21.4 grams of silver sodium phosphate how much silver phosphate will be made how much of the reagent in excess will remain at their reactions and that's something we'll do with the very end of all of his calculations. Again, we're starting off with a mouth. We need to have moles. Okay. So convert those two moles. We're doing the problem exact same way. We did the first week a metric one. What are the starting materials will be completely used up. It will be the limiting reagent and even though it's tempting to pick.  Silver nitrate because there's less moles of it.  Don't interviewed on the calculation. So what's use need versus have to do this one? Okay.  Question I'm going to ask is this one how much sodium phosphate will I need to react with? All the silver nitrate? I have there's my balanced chemical equation of 14.7 G of sodium phosphate by the way doesn't matter which of the two starting materials you pick as long as you're comparing to the other one. I'm 14.7 grams of silver nitrate convert that to moles. That means I have .08 700 moles of silver nitrate not what I'm going to use is the store IKEA metric ratio between the two starting materials there. I'm using the store Q metric really racing ship there.  One mole of sodium phosphate is necessary to react with 3 moles of silver nitrate, which means I need .02 900 moles of sodium phosphate that's needed. But if you look at the previous slide  I have  .131 moles k  I have Point 131 moles, but I only need .02 9.  since I have more  sodium phosphate that I need have is greater than need. Okay.  Sodium phosphate cannot be the limiting reagent.  I have more sodium phosphate that I need therefore. It can't be the limiting reagent. Well, if it's not the limiting reagent than the other starting material must be in the other starting material is silver nitrate therefore based on this. The silver nitrate is the limiting reagent again, we're looking at the have is greater than the need.  And then finally to finish this problem out.  I go through the same math, but I did before now. I'm doing the calculation. Okay, I'm doing the calculation based on the limiting reagent at this point in time. We don't care about the other one.  It's there an excess. We know some of its going to be left over at the end. We also know.  Some of its going to be used up but our calculation.  Is based on our limiting reagent we do that and again, we see the same answer that we got before cuz it was an excess as well there for the maximum amount of silver phosphate you'll be able to make is 12.1 grams is also what's called the theoretical yield next time. I have fun and I'm by the way before you go. Hang on. Hang on.  So just listen carefully in the experiment the way the experiment is written is it makes it sound like you are going each lab group is going to do a c l a m sulfuric acid the way it's going to be done in the laboratory is each bench is probably going to be set up so that half of the students are doing HCL and the other half are doing silver nitrate are am sorry sulfuric acid, and then each group is going to exchange data with the other group. Your tears will talk about this tomorrow. So just be prepared if there's going to be a slight modification out things are done. All right. Have a great day folks.  Keep an eye on Ted this weekend.  Can you see San Diego? "
