If you for example either got a new iclicker or you're not you're not if for some reason it's not registered to you and that does happen. You'll need to come and see me, but I'll post that up on Ted next party this weekend after my 48 exam. Most people have no idea what's coming after them. And then you're a week later. So, you know, all right.  Trust me. I'm not known for giving easy exams.  I'm also known for my students doing really well in classes after me, but very quickly. I hate to go through all this stuff again, but I'll add this week. This is the week. This is the first week that you need to have a procedural outline done before you come to lab so read about fire.  Read about procedure outlined and have one done. Now. It's not going to be great at the TA is going to look at it. But this experiment is the first experiment you have to be really ready. When you come in and tears are going to be under instructions that if you are not they're going to ask you to leave without allowing you to come back this week for sure because this is one of the experiments that everything has to go smoothly from start to finish what to know what you're doing. If you to have that you have to have a plan because it's an experiment where there's no it's not wearing panties anymore. Okay, you're not weighing pieces of aluminum are cutting out aluminum foil or measuring water actually working with real chemicals to determine the empirical formula and some of the chemistry. We'll talk a little bit of empirical formula this weekend in a little bit to be in beginning a next week so you could do it but be prepared watch the videos. We did the experiment I did make it available for people to get  That so please take a look at that and do it before Thursday. Okay. Also, this week's experiment experiment. Sorry empirical formula. The one you're doing on Friday is due a week from Thursday. It's same day as the exam. So and I'm not changing that so you need to make sure that you and and in fact you really have if you have any questions, you're going to want to ask me those questions next Tuesday or your ta before Thursday because the bottom line is it's your you have an exam to study for plus you have to get that done. Now. I personally think that you should finish. What did you should go home on Friday after your lab and finish writing up the lab finish doing all the calculation with the exception of maybe the question the the follow-up questions so that you can come on a Tuesday or your Tas.  What's the hours to ask questions there were too many people sitting out in front of the boxes last Thursday finishing their lab reports. That's not happening.  That's not going to happen from here on out because if it does I'm going to change the due time to 9:30 in the morning. So just make sure that you have it ready to get ready to go. Okay now lab cultural must this week, no ifs ands or buts. You have a lab coat you don't you don't you don't do the alarm a dress code for a number of you who buy it warned violations dress code last time some Tas threw you out some just contacted me. Trust me this week. I'm walking through.  And I will throw you out. I'll throw you off for any safety violation. Even if it just even if you think it's trivial, I don't care. I'm going to throw you out. The bottom line is socks or not pants.  Your ankles must be covered. You need to have socks and I don't care borrow some from someone. Okay wear sweatpants. If you have two skinny jeans if I think you're wearing skinny jeans or if I think at the fabric in your Gene is anything other than pure cotton. I'm going to ask you to leave the rule is in my class is from the bottom of your lab coat to the floor. If I see any skin. I am asking you to leave that asking you I'm telling you to leave today and that's going to be the end of it.  and if I throw you out of the lab twice  I'm going to fail you and I'm even going to do this if I have to throw two people out of anyone lab for dress code violations everybody in that lap.  Is going to lose 10 points on their experiment. So it is up to you to make sure I never had to do this before because you guys are not paying attention when I get when I get ta sending me emails or any text telling me I just wrote X number of students out because they weren't they were dressed appropriately.  k  Well, that's not happening anymore. Okay?  And yes want to call me or not to go right ahead. By the way, that's a racial slur if you do I'm going to take you to court. Okay, bottom line is don't just come prepared dress poop. If you're not sure plus sweatpants. Okay. I know it's going to be hot this week just do it, please but you wear socks discover your ankles and if you don't wear dress, it should be okay. If you don't wear a dress in your woman, that's okay, but it has to go to the floor, you know can't I mean basically I can't see any chemicals like your ankles in this week. We're dealing with stuff that you don't want to get on on you. Okay, I'm experiment to is due Thursday.

That's okay the plotting of the data. However, that really does need to be done from the oldest Penny to the newest and you don't average over decades. I don't know who the hell for that one.

So what you will need to do is plot your penny average pennyweight for like 1980 to 1985 97th, whatever you have plot them and whether you do a histogram or a bar graph I prefer you to do a bar graph because it's it in this case. It's more of a stark. It's more of Stark as to what's going on. Histograms are okay, but line graphs don't really work that well in for this experiment.  Just that I want and and this is the other thing I want lab reports.  I want procedural outlines. I want discussions and I want graphs all done by hand. No computers. Anything. On the computer is going to be marked as a zero and includes graphs now having said that.  After not after this experiment but there's two experiments we do later on that you require graphing those you will be able to grab either by hand or by Excel talk about that when it comes around, but right now whenever he grabbed my hand and no I'm not making an exception for you just do it. I want things written out. I want all of that wanted things done by hand part of it is I want you to get to the only way you'll ever going to get a feel for the data is to do that. And I'm honestly it sounds stupid but it's true. The only way you ever get a gyro for data is actually ply yourself plotted by hand on a computer eventually you get good enough at plotting data that you don't need that. Okay. Now why write everything out in hand? Why not? Let you word processor. First of all, there's always the cheating process of people passing around, you know, things one person does it and then they give it to someone else on a computer seized  But the second reason it's actually a more viable reason has to do with the fact that up to this point in time electronic electronic. Notebooks are not really accepted completely by the FDA by any by anybody really because you can still change data you can still change things. So it's a it's a gray area and it's an area. I want you to get used to doing things by hand. No other labs. You're going to come across at UCSD are going to let you are going to actually have you use electronic notebooks, but not in here. I'd like you to do this by hand. I want you guys to get used to that stuff. And yes part of it's because your freshman because you need to learn this.  But again, it's my class. I can do what I want. Okay, and you have to do what I want or  Companies that offer Dick's Sporting Goods sell so you can take it again. And yes, bitch me out.  For how I know we made it through this she made it to that who we are or can I just get the two or three years the same students come back to see me and said God your class. If I hadn't taken your class I wouldn't be doing as well in my other classes and the reason is because I made you  I made you a focus on how to on how to approach things and how to do things on how to do things from first principles and I'll tell you one final story before I finish this thing up last year. I got an email.  from a pediatrician in San Jose and he said to me  what if I had a patient come in?  I'm a young lady whose way to UCSD. And when I asked her what class is your take, she's taking she told me I'm taking camphor with Doctor Hagar and he said oh my God, I took that same class.  He was one of the first camp for students. I ever had 15 years ago. He said learn everything you can from this guy because I got the medical school because of him.  And that's not that's not BS, patting myself on the back of the eye will okay, but please I am just trying to understand the training is an important part. Okay homework notes. Some people have been concern or upset me a concern saying hey, there's some of the problems in I don't know if it's homework two or one of the homework we haven't talked about cuz I don't know how to do when they usually the ones that have to do with electron configurations. Don't worry about do the best you can on them. But in the end, I will adjust adjust homework for some of those four prongs are some there are some problems are just decide I didn't do it. It was Holly at how system does it and the bottom line is you can usually figure D answers out but for the most part I will take they do take that into account. So if there's problems you can't do because we haven't talked about him in class and some cases. We will it look like  We'll talk about the end of the course. I'm worried about those just do the best you can on on everything else and you'll be fine lab report notes again. I already said no word processing. No computer stuff. This is one of those things. There's one other thing. I do want to mention and that is or two other things. First of all,  no.  White out. Okay, if you use white out in the lab, we will Mark I'm ever going to tell us I'm going to tell the graders Take Five Points off for every millimeter of white out. You see on it. Okay to some of you already gone. Now, that's not going to be this experiment starting with starting with the next experiment not the one you turn now, but the next one no more why no white out of any type, please just if you need if you make a mistake some of you know this and other ones don't if you make a mistake like you go 1.785 grams just simply put a line through it put your initials and then right below it or above it 1.758 grams. Just write it like that. That is the that is the accepted method for doing it in a lab notebook for example a whiteout.  White out pencil erasers all that kind of stuff for data has is not allowed. I can tell you stories about that in real life stories where people have lost patents because of that stuff. So again, please do it this way. Why no white out is is one of the things and here's the other thing that this is I guess I was wondering if your buddy knows this data.  Must be in pain.  Okay, but everything else can be done in pencil. Okay, you can answer the questions in pencil. You can do your data analysis in in pencil by pan is what you must use when you're collecting the data. So just think about it like this all the data you collect in the experiment just make sure you put your pencil away and use your pain after that. You can use either. In fact, I I like students using pencil afterward because you make mistakes and the pain is hard to erase pencil isn't and and data analysis doesn't have the same constrictions on it as data collection that were clear on that. Alright, let's get back to this. We were finishing up the periodic table.  And if you remember from last time, I might go out to some notes I went through. What's what in the periodic table. I do want to point out some.  I do want to point out something else and this is another terminology that you just you you're going to hear now. It's not going to make much sense to you until we get to electron configurations, but I'll do it on this table here and it comes down to this this group of elements here is also known as as a whole as the S block.  of the elements elements  these elements here  K those elements there, which are the transition metals. Yes, that's true. They are the transition metals, but they're also known as a whole as what I've called the d block.  elements  Only elements over here.  These elements over here in hydrogen and helium are sort of exceptions to this, but I just including them in this in this picture as well. These are what are known as the p.  Block elements and then finally down below.  We have these down here.  These as a whole are known as the F block.  Element those come from that from orbitals they have to do with atomic orbitals and we'll learn more about those who don't learn a lot about those at 6 a m d s Block in the P block are also what are known as the main group elements or the representative elements. So the S and the P together are known as the main group elements K. The transition elements are transition between the S Block in the P block and then the F block elements are these elements that are sort of out of the periodic table. Really outside the periodic table. There are there for convene there put outside of it for convenience of drawing the periodic table. Now again, these are terms that I want you to come to grips with because as it turns out o s block elements have similar chemistry's  Okie block elements have similar chemistry zaldy block him have similar chemistry F block have similar chemistry's in addition to the fact that we have groups and periods in what have you the blocks themselves? Also give us some information also tell us something about how they actually behave and again, it's a distinction the more you can hear it. Now the better of the easier it's going to be later on. So for example, we talked about the group 1 elements The Alkali Metals the alkaline metals their shiny soft a low melting points. They all react rapidly with water to form flammable hydrogen gas.  An alkaline or basic Solutions alkaline and basic mean the same thing group 2 elements beryllium magnesium calcium strontium barium in radon their lustrous their silvery same as ones by and large they react with oxygen they are less reactive to water the alkali metals, but they still react with water. They're just slow poke however to put a last and then they react fast and they always form H2. And this is what I mean by the s-block elements behave similarly both the alkali metals the alkaline-earth have similar reactivities as far as this kind of stuff goes.  If we end what I'm doing here, by the way, it's just talking about some of the notable notables. Now here are the group 7. These are the halogens now. It's really hard to see.  This one here. I'm going to color it in you can't see it very well.  Is it just doesn't show up?  There we go. Chlorine is really kind of a greenish a greenish-yellow gas. Okay. So in this thing over here now, it's notice. It's fluorine chlorine bromine. I didn't ask teen astatine is the one that's man-made so we don't have it in a vial here. It's radioactive does never long Half-Life so over here we have this is cl2.  This is br-2 chlorine is a gas bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid you can see first of all, they have unique colors. That's the sort of always surprised me. It's really the first group of elements in the periodic table are the elements in selves have some unique colors as you go down up compound the elements that you noticed. There's one missing other than astatine exploring. Why don't we have a vial of flooring showing on here? First of all, too dangerous is all hell and second of all it eats glass.  So you can put it in a glass vial. Okay flooring is without a doubt the bad. It is the baddest element the periodic table every other element in the periodic table is  No, two ways about it.  Chlorine oxygen does around says, oxygen, you know, and I'll kick your butt flooring says oxygen come here and oxygen. Yes, sir, because flooring is bad stuff man. It is tough stuff. It is a busy probably the most reactive element in the periodic table. They are very rosov. They're not old found in nature in combination with other elements. They are not found by themselves.  You don't find a by themselves. For some reason I seem to think I'd and can be in some places, but I don't even think that's true. These elements have to actually be extracted and synthesized or more recombined to make them. You cannot get them. You cannot just fine like a fluorine mine or a brownie mine for example, or chlorine mine are very useful and they're very useful because what are things that they can you could do with them as you can use the even treat Metals with them for example to make the corresponding halogen compounds the halogen compounds themselves are very reactive or unreactive I should say and they can be used for a number of different things the halogens you're going to find showing up again and again in all the chemistry courses you take and when they show up there they are for very important reasons as to why they're there.  Okay.  The group 8A elements are what are called the noble gases. They are they used to be called the inert gases eventually found out that they did. Some of them do react but bigger ones at 10 to react. I'm there a colorless now, obviously, here's a neon sign and you go how can they be colorless? Well, they are colorless gases. However, if you put an electrical discharge through them they change color they actually do they actually light up the reason behind that we won't get into here and they each have a different color as to what color they they give off when you put an electrical discharge through them. They are very very low chemical reactivity.  Even though they're not called the inert gases anymore. They really are pretty inert.  Haley are pretty in art things like Xenon and Krypton people have been able to make compounds with Xenon in Krypton, but they have to use oxygen and fluorine to do it. And like I said before oxygen and fluorine pretty much react with anything neon and helium on the other hand or two elements that seem to be resistant to fluorine and oxygen they don't seem to react with much of anything. So they really some of the gas is really are totally inert but as you start to move down the periodic table in the atoms and the and the gases the atoms get bigger and bigger they do should show some reactivity.  Mixtures are something that we that we that we went across a lot in chemistry heterogeneous mixtures apart at least interesting of all of them have water more visible boundaries between the components and they are non uniform in composition and what that means is that for heterogeneous mixture if you were to take a if you if you for example, well sand and water exists as an example of a heterogeneous mixture another example of a heterogeneous mixture that most people don't really realize milk is a heterogeneous mixture. So is mayonnaise and when you think about you go away mat that really can't beat that doesn't look like that. There's a reason for that that I'll get into when I talk about emotions later on but here's the here's the real what's going on with a heterogeneous mixture.  Typically in a heterogeneous mixture if I take a sample from there in this is done on the board for those be looking at it. So here's some stuff on the bottom if I take a sample there if I take a sample there if I take a sample there.  in a heterogeneous mixture  There will be a different composition for the mixture depending on where I take the sample and a heterogeneous mixture.  There is a different composition depending on where you take the sample.  now you might  composition  pendant on  Where you take sample?  Spell as you might guess.  Those are not heterogeneous mixtures are not as interesting or not as easy to deal with as for example, a homogeneous is going to get to in a second. Okay, you don't think about the fact about this. What if your Coca-Cola or whatever you happen to drink was a heterogeneous mixture where the first sip tastes really good and then as you get down lower in the think it starts to taste worse and worse and all sides of a sweet again. You never drink that stuff. Okay, we like uniformity in our flavors like uniformity in our food. This is why most people don't like lumpy mashed potatoes.  Because you take did you get the smoother than acting on centers a lump and it's just it's disconcerting heterogeneous mixtures are hard to deal with not just from a chemical standpoint, but also from a from a aesthetic standpoint. What is a homogeneous mixture mixture?  Using the same picture I drew on the board if this mixture or homogeneous, it doesn't matter where you take the sample and will have identical compositions. So the sample  so the composition  does not depend  underwear  where you took sorry?  The sample from the nice thing about a heterogeneous mixtures because it's heterogeneous means also that it should have a uniform reactivity throughout because the chemical is disperse. Everything is dispersed equally through solution is a is another term we use for a homogeneous mixture. Now, the reason homogeneous a solution is a homogeneous mixture and you need to understand  Mixtures can be solid with solid solid with liquid liquid with liquid gas with liquid or gas with gas or solid with gas. For example, K. Homogeneous mixtures can also be any of those things with some exceptions obviously, but a solution is also the term we use for a homogeneous mixture typically since we work with solutions that have since we work with a solution that has more than one component in and out in it than another for example a solvent.  We use the term solution more often than homo genius mixture, even though the two were identical an aqueous solution is the term we use when the when something is when the solution is in water and we abbreviate aqueous solution in parentheses with a Q. I'm so for example, if I were to say something like NaCl and then in parentheses a q that means sodium chloride that has been dissolved in water to form a homogeneous solution. And in fact that AQ indicates, we are talking about a homogeneous mixture in water.  A solution in water, okay.  Although we normally think of solutions as liquids and in fact, that's not a bad way to go if it think about it.  Exists in all three physical States for example brass is a solution of two different metals.  The air you're breathing right now is a solution of nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and a little bit of argon if it's relatively pure are other things if it's not but the bottom line is it is a solution is a homogeneous solution in medically and probably practically if I were to take a sample of the air right here where my hand is had to take a sample of the air in the very back of the room the composition between the two would be in distinguishable. That's the idea of a solution.  Another thing that comes up in chemistry, these ideas of laws laws are important because and I need to be very clear here laws or something that chemists have come up with or scientist have come up with after doing multiple observations a law does not attempt to explain anything.  A law is a summary of hundreds of observations.  If every morning you got up.  And you notice the sun rises in the East and then every evening you noticed the sun rises in or sets in the west and you do this over and over and over again, eventually, you could come up with something called The Law of sun.  Sun rises in the East sets in the west and a law is something that no matter where you go wherever you went on the Earth. Where were you went that wall would be obeyed. It doesn't explain what's going on that comes later on but it is something that we can rely on we can always come back to Soul or has become important. So one of the laws it's important in chemistry something on the law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation of mass says Mass can neither be created nor destroyed. It means that the total mass of ass of substances does not change during a chemical reaction. This is one of those wash want to keep in the back of your head because it means that if you start with a hundred grand total  all of your starting materials  your products have to equal 100 grams or more importantly.  If you start with a hundred grams of whatever at the very end of re of the reaction regardless of what happens in the reaction, you have to have a hundred grams at the end whether that's left over starting material plus product or all product. It doesn't matter. You cannot lose Mass. Okay. So if for example I take calcium oxide CA Oh and I combined it with carbon dioxide, okay?  If I take 56.08 grams of calcium oxide and I mix it with 44.01 grams that total amount.  game  that total amount  Yes.  100.09 grams  If I were to react the calcium oxide with the carbon dioxide to make calcium carbonate in this is how this happens.  I should have exactly the amount of product.  As all the starting materials I combine that's what the law of conservation of mass says.  What the law of conservation of mass is really saying.  Is that in a closed vessel?  Whatever you start with.  You have to have the same total mass at the end.  And what that means is this what happens if instead of 100.09 grams of calcium carbonate what if I get 50 grams of calcium carbonate?  Cannot cannot happen. The answer is yes, but what happened to the other 50.09 grams?  What?  No, it's a closed vessel to gas never escaped.  What happened to the other whatever they're 50 grams?  I can't disappear.  Exactly. It stays the starting materials.  Turn that off. Where's that me know. It's not Siri Siri. It was cereal when it came on in here came out of my organic class.  I said something like you seriously can't believe it and Siri goes. I don't know what you're talking about.  Anyway, so bottom line is if you don't get the total amount of product as the starting materials you put in that means are starting materials leftover. Okay. It just can't disappear while conservation of mass is one of those things you forget, but it's useful a lot of times because it allows you to calculate how much of your starting materials are still left over or in some cases. How much gas was formed whatever, okay.  Another one of major importance is the law of definite or constant composition. I call this the law of constant composition and what it says. Is that no matter where you go get a chemical from a pure chemical from a particular compound is composed of the same elements in the same relative amount in percentages by Mass.  I know some people say we're okay. That means carbon. Dioxide is always one carbon into oxygen Leah, that's true. But a lot of time this was this lock him up before people knew what the chemical formula of these of these things were in essence what it means is that this if I have calcium carbonate, okay now remember calcium carbonate  is  CaCO3 it's made up of one calcium atom one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms in 20 grams. We analyzed it we find we have 8 grams of calcium 2.4 grams of carbon in 9.6 grams of oxygen which means for everyone part of calcium chloride.  Point four of that is calcium .12 is carbon and .48 is oxygen but nobody really uses that one. But what they do is they talk about the percent composition or the percent by mass and these are the numbers that you get for example for the calcium. This is 8.0 grams divided by the 20 grams you started with  * 100 in K the carbon  Is the 2.4 grams divided by the 20 grams?  * 100 any Oxygen  is the 9.6 divided by 20 G * 100. What that means is that anywhere you find calcium carbonate you're going to get the same composition by mass the same percentages as long as it's pure now at this point in time. It doesn't mean much to you except for this if we know what the percent composition is. We can work our way backwards to the chemical formula. That's what you're going to do on Friday.  You're going to take a certain amount of zinc. You going to take a certain amount of biotin?  You're going to do the reaction in such a way that all of the iodine is used up and excess zinc.  You're going to separate the excess zinc from the zinc iodide that you made all the iron is gone. There's ink left over.  the law  Okay, but why we just we talked about just before conservation of mass.  The law of conservation of math is going to tell you how much zinc was used up.  You know how much I then was used up because you put that in that's going to allow you to get to a percent composition for zinc iodide from that you're going to be able to get to the chemical formula by something. We're going to talk about in a little bit either this week or early early next week.  Electrons in electron configuration. I put this slide in here just as a sort of like as a as a preview of the future but something that I want fortunately a dark future for some of you the corner canex is not fun. OK every chemist. Sorry. I have to take quantum mechanics and quantum mechanics is like Counting.  The number of angels that can sit on the head of a pin except with math with integrals and not just your rinky-dink single in a girl's butt.  These bad boys.  Okay.  Yeah, if you're lucky it's it's complicated.  But what's interesting about it is that once you've gone through quantum mechanics, there are things that can be explained.  Things we can understand that we can't explain or understand in other ways and it allows us to make predictions and the predictions as it turns out a really useful. They don't get help us to predict what new drugs to make they can help us to predict why compound a reacts with compound be but doesn't react with compounds see so it's really useful. So here's some fruit some few basic notes if you remember that all atoms are comprised of  Protons and neutrons. These are the nucleons.  They are in the nucleus outside of the nucleus are the electrons.  The electrons if you want to think about it, you could think about the electrons as being Like Satellites floating around the nucleus planet, for example, K. The electrons. However are responsible for the chemistry of the element. It's the electrons that undergo either moving from one atom to another or combinations with other atoms to make bond. The electrons are what are what allow you to make bonds make compounds elements with similar chemical properties are in the same group.  And what that means is this elements in the same group have the same outer configuration of electrons.  They don't have the same configuration of electrons, but they have the same outer configuration of electrons.  Noble gases are unreactive there for something must be special about their electron makeup. And in fact what we find for the noble gases is the noble gases have  What's called an?  octet  Or closed shell.  What does it mean anything to you? But what it should say to you is this the what these do what you're something special about having this closed shell about having the configuration of a noble gas elements with similar chemistry's are in the same group and elements in the same group have similar electron configuration at least in the as at least in the as they're reacting electrons go they have what are called ideal valence electrons. Now, this is the distinction valence electrons are the outermost electrons the electrons it actually do the bonding to the chemistry. Okay?  Experiments showed that the number of valence electrons an element has is equal to its Roman numeral group number for the main group elements and its eight valence electrons is a magic or special number. So when we look at the periodic table, and this is why the Roman part of this is so important if we look for example at carbon carbon is in group for carbon silicon germanium tin lead that Roman numeral for tells us that it has four valence electron or four of these reactive electrons that lay the outskirts of the atom.  And so anything that has those four electrons K or going to behave similarly nitrogen is group 5K nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony. Bismuth all have 5 valence electrons. Okay. Now the interesting thing is the group at the very end helium-neon with exception of helium neon argon Krypton Xenon rate on Dental Group 8, by the way, hydrogen and helium weird. Just leave out of this discussion for the time being but these are hiring group 8. So neon argon Krypton Xenon. Radon all have eight electrons. And remember. Those are the know what were the inert gases. There's something special about that and in fact if we start really getting looking at this thing,  Sodium typically is present as a plus one iron to Verizon in Acts chapter. What does plus one mean plus one means I've taken and removed one electron from it sodium is number 11. That means has 11 protons neutral sodium has 11 electrons to have the same number of electrons as protons it. However, I remove one of those electrons how many electrons do I have now?  How many?  Neon has 10 electrons Magic.  strontium  has 38 electrons does strontium likes to lose two electrons that loses two electrons. What is it have?  36 magic again  You have to be careful with this because this works only for the main groups.  Nitrogen is typically found is a -3 iron.  7 + 3123 is 10 same number of electrons does neon again Magic.  Yeah, by the way, the difference between magic and science or science fiction and science is 5 years.  That's that's usually the the way it did the way it's set up.  All right. So let's look at the next thing I want to do.  Which is ionic and molecular compounds now where to start looking here at actual Compounce.  What's better way for those of you if you if you're interested in science fiction, some of you are some of you aren't I know, you know, I'm a big science fiction. But if you ever read the if you ever really want to read a good good series read the foundation Trilogy, not the not all 20 books. He wrote on the Fook is that all of my very good but Foundation foundation and Empire in second Foundation at Trilogy is really good and one of the things that shows up in Foundation the very first one is this idea of science versus magic technology and Magic think about this.  Think about this in a fact. I'm actually reading a series right now called schooled in Magic which is kind of like the same kind of idea. That's more fantasy than science fiction, but think about this if you went to if you weld up in like they were transported from here.  In to say the Middle Ages or before that.  And you knew how to make gunpowder.  all of a sudden you would not be a scientist you would be a magician because you could do something with rocks that nobody else could do and in fact, you could be the most powerful person with the knowledge you have in the you and the world of these their Universe their world because as long as you didn't tell anybody about the science behind what you did  Nobody would ever figure it out.  Unless you gave them directions to do how to do it. Which why would you do that?  All right, elements and compounds we've already gone through this slide already. This is just a distinction between elements compounds and molecules. Remember compounds are molecules molecules are compounds but the sort of Distinction that people really kind of put their is that compounds tend more we use the term compound typically when we're talking about things that have ionic bonds.  It's primarily and we use the term molecule or talking about things that have covalent bonds primarily as far as you're concerned. We're going to consider those two to be essentially equal.  Molecule is a term that gets used when we are talking about compounds that have almost exclusively all covalent bonds. It just it's it's just something that we talked about. So, where are you in spell Iams are species that contain a charger that will charge because they have an in dim in balance between the number of protons and the number of electrons does a neutral atom has as many electrons as it does protons. Okay, if the number of electrons is different that species will carry a net charge and those are what we call irons. So for example, if I were to look at something like sodium  Again, we talked about sodium sodium neutral. Okay. And did you do that? I'm going to put a little zero up here. Now. I don't do this very often. I do this just to show you that zero means there's no charge on this thing sodium having no charge. You don't need to do that. By the way, it's assumed if you write in a unless you're put in if you must show the charge of a Senayan so sodium has 11 by look up in the periodic table. It has 11 protons and 11 electrons does a neutral sodium has 11 protons and 11 electrons sulfur sulfur in its in its neutral state has a total of 16 protons and therefore 16  And therefore 16 electrons. Okay. Now if the sodium  where to lose electrons  to get to the noble gas configuration of neon or sulfur would gain electrons to get to the noble gas configuration of argon they would form ions. In fact, that's exactly what happens here. So sodium for example  sodium  will lose one electron to become sodium + 1  chauffeur  will gain two electrons  to become sulfur -2 and so sulfur mine is too has 16 protons, but it has 18 electrons. It has two more electrons than the neutral that's why I've got a mine is to charge that charge is what we call both an oxidation state for a single atom and its formal charge.  It has a it carries with it a formal charge Orion's are ions that are positively charged queso A cation.  Is a is a species that is positively.  charged like for example iron 3 + sodium + 1  magnesium 2 +  Okay, these are species that would rather lose electrons that gain electrons and this by the way is typical of metals Metals would rather lose electrons than gain them.  Metals would rather form cations and anions and in fact do so almost exclusively.  Yes bless you.  By the way, if you don't know there's really bad flu is going around this year, make sure that you get cold meds and take care of yourself and don't get me sick. Okay.  I have to come you don't have students don't students. Theoretically don't have to come to class cuz it goes watch my podcast. I have to come to class even if I'm on my deathbed.  So if you see me wielding here in a bed sometime, you'll know why.  Are lions are lions are negatively.  charged  Ryan's something like sulfur. Mine is to chlorine -1 etcetera.  What's a carbon - 4 that's a rare one carbon - 4 is rare, but it's carbide. You won't really get into that here.  The other kind of Ian these irons are shown up to this point. I'm are what are known as monatomic ions in other words one atom.  1 charged however, there are things called polyatomic ions in this by the way is something you're going to want to start memorizing the polyatomic ions are ions that have more than one element making it up for example so4 -2  Cielo - 1 these are more complicated.  k  carbonate CO3 -2 for example carbonate  we'll talk about Lewis structure later on.  Carbonate has this structure each line by the way indicates a two electron Bond. So carbonate these polyatomics are comprised of atoms that are covalently bound to one another.  polyatomics comprised of elements that are that are covalently bound to one another  and carry a nut charge.  Because of how the electrons are distributed distributed throughout the molecule, by the way talk about what makes an alliance typically an alliance are formed from nonmetals. Nonmetals typically want to form an alliance.  And in fact do so almost exclusively with rare exceptions the metalloids metalloids.  They would rather form cations if possible, but can form anions if needed. So the metalloids Mobley told said the metalloids lie somewhere between being a metal and a nonmetal they do so here or in this case as well.  So by the time I come by the way of the most important an atom can be converted into a Charged particle cause an ion by gaining or losing electrons. The charges shown is a superscript to the symbol for the element. It's always shown to the right not to the left or to the right of the element. Although even that changes as probably X loss of one or more electrons forms a cation the gain of one or more electrons, it forms anions main group elements will gain or lose electrons to obtain an electron count equal to a noble gas by the way only works for the main group elements. You cannot use this for transition metals. You cannot use this for f blocks. There's a different thing going on with those K halogens easily gain an additional electron to accomplish this alkali metals easily lose an electron to accomplish just as well and so the way  figure out what's going on is this  look at where look at the particular Elementary interested in what's a boron aluminum and ask yourself? How many electrons does it have to gain become the same number of electrons as a noble gas for aluminum. It would have to gain 1 2 3 4 5. Okay. How many electrons does it have to lose aluminum would have to lose 1 2 3 to get to the Dionne configuration. Whichever path is shorter is the one that's going to take.  So for example losing three.  Is a shorter path in gaining 5 so aluminum is going to lose three electrons and become + 3.  Oxygen can either gain to to become neon or it can lose 1 2 3 4 5 can helium. It takes a shorter path it gains two electrons. Here is the interesting. What about carbon silicon germanium tenleid carbon can either gain for or lose 4.  To get to a noble gas configuration. Which one does it do?  ecos  I think I just want a covalent bond and that's what it does whenever you have a choice whenever it whenever the two choices are the same those elements are closed I should say cuz it turns out to be close to energy as well the elements tend to form covalent bonds rather than forming anything else would again, this is one of those kind of things that we run across any good predictive. It's a good predictive as to what's going to happen.  Important properties are really decide whether something is going to be is going to become a cation or an anion and therefore periodic properties that are of interest but in terms of iron formation in terms of I informations, there are two that are most important. What is call Diane ization energy, which is abbreviated as I either i e x where X is some number or I sibex depends on the book you're looking at it is the energy required to remove one electron from a single.  Atom in the gaseous State the subscript indicates which electron in the order is being removed. So for example,  In something like calcium. Okay calcium.  Going to calcium plus one plus one electron. This would be ionization energy one for calcium plus one going to calcium + 2 + 1 electron.  That would be ionization energy to okay. Now, here's the part that you have to kind of get your wrap your head around if I take calcium.  Going to calcium plus 2 plus 2 electrons hear the energy is equal to ionization energy 1 + ionization energy to in other words, you have to add up individual ionization energies to get the total energy for that process to occur. So when you lose two electrons,  You have to take the energy for the first loss and added to the energy for the second loss to get the total energy.  Low iron ization Energy Savers cation formation lower ionization energy means it's easy to remove electrons.  So when you're comparing two elements, you look at their ionization energy. The one that has a lower ionization energy is more likely to become to lose the electron in the one with the higher one. Okay. Now there's a similar thing for electron affinity which is a little more complicated because of sign as it turns out electron affinity is dafont or east ye and also this also is is also by the way is  Isabella ax is the energy released on adding an electron to a single atom in the gaseous State high electron affinities.  Meaning a lot of energy is released when you have an electronic favor and I information.  Okay.  By the way when you release energy.  What you do is you relieve lower the overall energy of the system. That's a good thing. Okay, again, electron affinities are additive. So for example, if I take sulfur plus one electron.  To get the sulfur -1. This is electron affinity one. If I take sulfur - 1 + 1 electron to get the sulfur. Mine is to  this is electron affinity to and soul for sulfur plus two electrons to go to Sulphur. Mine is to the total energy is equal to electron affinity one.  What's electron affinity to?  Again, the actual numbers can be found in tables or given to you or give it to you on exams, but there are some Trends, okay.  Going from left to right in the periodic table ionization energy and electron affinity values both increase. So what that means is that in the periodic table just down here in the periodic table what we see is this here is my periodic table. We see them increase as we go from the top or the bottom to the top. We see them increase as we go from the left to the right, which means that the net is like this. Okay, that means ionization energies are increasing as you go from the left corner of the periodic table to the top right corner the left bottom corner to the top right corner.  Electron affinities are also increasing. So what does that mean? That means that elements in the bottom?  left of the periodic table  you can let's go over to hear in the bottom left in the periodic table want to become a nikat is very very much.  Adams in the top right corner want to become anions very much. We leave by the way the the how at the noble gases out of this discussion. Alkali metals lose electrons. Most easily halogens gain electrons most easily again that this increase electronic electron affinity is increasing from the left to the right ionization energy is increasing from the left to the right. So we see the tendency  To form an alliance as we go from left to right. We see the tendency to form cations as we go from right to left. Okay, the noble gases night or gain or lose electrons easily we can force them to do it but it costs huge amounts of energy do it. They have very high IE values near very low electron affinity values. In other words. They don't want to become cations. They don't want to become an alliance. They don't want to do much of anything. Okay main group elements near the middle of the Periodic Table of intermediate values of both I and has a shattered and electron affinity and lack of strong preference to either gain or lose electrons and when you don't have a strong preference Theatre gain or lose electrons, you would rather form covalent bonds. And in fact, this is what we see for ionization energy and electron affinity electron affinity down here ionization energy than red on the top.  We see the Sawtooth pattern.  At this periodic pattern we talked about we see again. We see an ape we go from lithium the neon for ionization energy. We see the ionization energy increase as we go from left to right if we look for example at the electron affinity. We see it decrease if we go from say flooring over we see a decrease as electron affinity is not as stuck as the on ization energies and there are some anomalies in all of this that you'll talk about more in 6/8 and we will in here.  What are properties of what are some of the properties of ionic compounds first of all most ionic compounds are usually crystalline solids that Dede ionic bonds the irons for allow these networks to form these form these of crystalline bonds. Their held is crystalline structures are held rigidly in place by a fraction to their neighbors this attraction is what's known as the cool ombac Force.  This attraction is what's known as the cool ombac Force.  The kalabich force is the energy.  Of two atoms are held together typically by their charges and the typical energy.  Lambic is proportional.  To the charge of the cation.  * the charge of the anion divided by the distance  between  the cation and the anion  Okay.  so if we have a positively charged species and a negatively charged species, there is a distance between these are  those three things to charge of the two lions and the distance.  I would go into this. So what this also tells us. Is this the attraction between a + 1 + a + a - 1 Iron?  Is less than the attraction between a plus 2 Iron and a mine is to Ian.  number words the strength of the attraction increases as the charge of the ions increase  However, once an ionic solid is dissolved in water or melted. Here's an important thing water is very good at solvating and iron and in the solvation of irons what-you-see-is-what-you-get you're positively charged species.  surrounded by water  Can you get your negatively charged species?  surrounded by water  So the reason that they dissolve the reason is ionic Network can be broken up in water can dissolve is because of the fact that water.  can surround the cation in the airline, however  Water is not able to do this for all.  ionic compounds  Some ionic compounds are not water-soluble and they're not water-soluble because the water is under able to overcome the strength of the attractions between the Giants.  So compounds can be soluble or insoluble in water soluble in water because the water can surround the cations in the Airlines and soluble because you can't break up the ionic the crystalline lattice.  Once an ionic solid is dissolved in water or melted the ions can move freely and one science can move freely they can conduct electricity.  Sodium chloride by itself will not conduct electricity. It's an insulator. But as soon as you get it wet.  Or you melt it.  The irons can move one science can move electrical current can be conducted.  Ionic solids are not malleable, which means that if you strike them with something they shatter.  Ionic compounds dissolve in water if the attraction between the water in the eye and overcomes the attraction of the irons for one another again solubility in water something that we're going to talk about here is directly a function.  directly a function of how well  The water is able to break break up to covalent bonds that's enough for today. Please make sure you put you in if you have it. We will talk about covalent compounds next time and other things.  Can you see sandiego.edu? "
