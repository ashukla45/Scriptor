So again, click in using the letter D today, and we'll talk more about this some.  I'll talk more about once it's posted up there. I'm so exam one has been moved from Thursday to next Tuesday. Okay, so it will be in this room against just going to be like it's all I did was I moved at 1. Because I wanted to finish module 6 before the exam. So again, you shoot you all got this. You should have all got this email and it's on Ted anyway, so be here by about 7:45 so we can do not come into the room until we let you in the room. We're going to seat you it's going to be kind of a mess eating people, but we're going to see people as and get the exam started as quickly as we can. You will have the entire. To you will have the entire. To take the exam. Most people will be able to finish it within about an hour even though you about an hour and 20 minutes. But again, you still have that extra time if you if you  Beat It  couple homework notes, by the way, I'm only changing this exam the set the second exam is still on the date that scheduled in the in the syllabus homework notes in there some lab notes. All my girls are simple ones are some of you sent me these panicked emails about how the mastering chemistry says. You didn't complete the assignment when you just deal with one problem that you didn't finish. Well, yeah, you didn't complete it but having said that so when mastering chemistry Werks they look at it and they say hello, you did 70 out of 71 problems. That's not complete. That doesn't mean you're not getting the credit for what you did that stuff in it. That's how that's how it is or how it's how it's processor works and it says it just simply says there were problems at work done. It's not a big deal if you for example if you were running at  90% let's sing running 90% or 95% and like maybe one or two questions. You didn't do well. Yes those will count against you but it's not going to change a percentage by very much. I mean obviously the way that the thing set up it's that kind of stuff's not going to hurt you so don't get don't worry about that kind of stuff. It will say somewhere along the lines about you what percentage you have and that's all you really need to worry about is that percentage again? I know it's so distressing the first time you see it, but that's how it closes down things. I also opened up a bunch of homework. So some of which are module 6 related Lookout go make sure you look at those and you look at what to do dates are on the man that you do and that you do do those AB lab notes are relatively simple. You have an issue of this experiment by the end of today. You will know how to do the calculations to finish the experiment. That's another and there will be the  kind of calculations on the exam  That they're not difficult it just something you haven't seen you want to make sure you go through it. This week's lab is called the Blue food coloring lab. Now. This one doesn't have a pre lab. If I remember correctly it has you have but you have to turn a procedural outlining and this is the first procedural outline actually counts for points. And this lab also has a discussion that you'll have to turn in the following week that counts for points. So make sure you go up and read about what a procedural outline is. It makes you do it again. There's something that you should know and then keep in mind in a repetitive experiment where you're doing the same thing over and over again, like for example measure Out 3 ml of sample free.  Turn into a to make a measurement rinse the tube. Let's say now you going to do with sample for the next step can say repeat steps to through 2 through 4 with sample number two, and then the next step would say repeat steps 2 through 4 with sample number five. In other words. Anyway time you're doing a repetitive thing. You can put something like that in your procedure outline the procedure while I like I said is the goal of that is you can look at it and say okay where I am I click things off as you're doing it when you come in and Ladder have to show it to the ta ta is going to initial it and then you're going to do the lab and when you leave you're going to hand the procedural outline into your ta so he's going to hear she is going to check it to make sure it's done again. If you don't have it done you're going to get kicked out of the lab.  And from here on out I haven't been asking the TA is to keep track of these they know got to get kicked out, but they just tell me so and so. They just tell me I kick to apply the lab or someone will come and tell me from now on if you get kicked out of the lab, whatever reason those are going to be undroppable zeros, you were not to be able allowed to drop that lab and if you get kicked out twice, I'll fill you in chem for so you need to end the same reason people getting kicked out for the same reason for not having socks on. Hey, I hate to be a Sox Nazi. That's the way it is. Okay wear boots for goodness sakes but wear socks. I mean, come on you go to Thrift Store get a pair of socks.  Get a pair of socks put them on.  I mean, otherwise I'm going to get duct tape and I'm going to duck tape or duct tape around your ankles. Okay, and you're going to wish you at socks cuz the duct tape I have in my office is T-Rex. If you ever tried to pull that stuff off your skin skin comes with it. So please watch your watch your letter again. How many of you were violating this maybe three people for people in the class?  So the rest of you are sitting here listening to me going was not me your rights. Not you it's those people it's the person who's doing. This is the one that's going to injure you.  You heard my thing about drunk drivers drunk drivers never get killed in an accident almost why cuz they're drunk.  Hey Brother Julie other people  You know why you don't like drunk driver still get don't kill very often and answers a really simple one. If you've ever done any kind of of any kind of fighting or martial arts have you one of the things they tell you is that when someone punches you when someone hits you you basically go with the blow and that lessens what happens we'll think about what happens if a drunk person falls down the stairs. We don't do any better. They just kind of don't they just fall like a bag? Okay what happens when you fall down the stairs and you're completely sober when the first thing you do is stiffen up and as soon as you stiffen up, you break. Okay. So where does this come from? Well, the next the the problem is no matter how safe you are. It's that moron next to you. Just going to get you hurt.  And I wish I could tell you what was different but I've been in Labs all my life and trust me. It's true. Okay, and all of you look around around next time and look at the people around you in that end and you see what I mean anyway.  So that's enough of that. Actually it's not but there's not much else I can do about it. All right, where we start where we ended last time was here. We talked about the amount of substance. We are talking about the idea of a mole k a mole is a large amount of material. Okay, in terms of atoms a mole contain 6.022 * 10 to the 23rd atoms as a huge huge number and yet  And yet a mole of different substances what you see up here.  Can vary in both weight and amount and one of the reasons that the amounts change is because of the fact that density of these things change look at the amount of mercury know. I don't love this doesn't really make it's hard to really see how much is really there. But that's a small petri dish there that has the mercury in it. And it looks like it's a tiny amount compared to 32 grams of sulfur sulfur is less dense than Mercury. Okay, but each one of those 12 grams of carbon is 32 grams of sulfur 64 grams of copper 27 G of lead 210 G of mercury all of those.  Contain the same number of atoms in one mole is 6.022 * 10 to the 23rd. The reason the weights are different is because each one of these compounds has a different molar mass or atomic mass. Nother words and Mercury atom is bigger than a carbon atom. So 6.022 * 10 to the 23rd Mercury atoms are going to weigh more than the same amount of carbon as we used to call. We do call the the mole of a chemist doesn't and we'll explain it to piece put people like this won't what weighs more a dozen eggs or doesn't cars.  Okay. Well, I hope you say it doesn't cars unless you got the biggest damn chickens on Earth, but it doesn't cars and yet a dozen cars and a dozen eggs has exactly the same number in them 12. So again, it depends on what the mass of an individual unit is as to what the total mass of a mole of something is going to be so again the amount of substance in mole. We typically use the lowercase n u c lowercase and used for only one other thing if I remember correctly in chemistry, but here we're going to use this exclusively for the number of moles of something till we get to Quantum Mechanics show the number of substance pieces, which is a capital N is equal to the number of moles of something you have times Avogadro's number.  And so and the number of moles of something you have is the amount of something you have / Avogadro's Number the amount of atoms you have / an avocados number of atoms. Okay. So can we relate this Mass to moles? And yes, the answer answer is yes, if we know the weight of one unit of what we're interested in.  By multiplying that buy avocados number to give us the weight of one mole of it. This is what's called the molar mass or the mass of one mole of whatever you happen to be looking at. Okay. Here are a news another slide showing your mole of various materials. And again, it's just to give you a perspective of how big a mole is an actual quantity terms on terms of atoms but in terms of quantity in terms of gram in terms of grams, and you can see that what this points out is the fact that a mole the number is a very very large number and because atoms are very very small because molecules are very very small the amounts are not a huge so  Can you can hold a mole? I mean a mole of Water Rinse your mouth with that much actually more than that. So it's not that much so it comes down to this idea of how do we determine what the molar mass of any substance is well to do that. What we need to do is we need to look at what makes up the substance that were interested in.  and if we were to take  The atomic mass for the molar mass of each of the substances that make it up add them together. We would get the total molar mass the total mass of one more. So for example al2 SO3 areso for 3 right this as  al2  s-300 12  Now that is the actual that is a chemical formula for this compound aluminum sulfate, but that formula al2 ES300 12 tells us really nothing about it, except it contains aluminum sulfur and oxygen the formula on the left where I put aluminum and sulfate there tells us that this compound is made up of aluminum and sulfate ions.  The formula on the right tells us nothing except for what makes it up the combining ratios and that's what those subscripts are. Those subscripts are the combining ratios. They are either they can either looked at the number of each of the atoms that make up whatever we're looking at or the moles of that Adam K. So aluminum sulfate has two atoms each one aluminum sulfate has two atoms of aluminum three atoms of sulfur and 12 atoms of oxygen.  or we could say that one mole of aluminum sulfate contains 2 moles of aluminum 3 moles of sulfur  and 12 moles of oxygen again were using mono atomic masses here using the masses in the periodic table to do the calculation. So let's look at what we get here. Well, if we do this what we realize is that  There are two aluminum's. Okay, and each aluminum is 26.98 grams per mole. Where did I get this number this number here?  Is the atomic mass?  from the periodic table  and in fact, that's where I'm getting.  That's why I'm going to get each one of these from I'm going to get these numbers right out of the periodic table now.  I think I have actually I don't think I thought I had one with me but it turns out I had the MRI are card for my olearius for my Kim for my cam for a 40 class which would freak you out if you saw it, but  best super next year for most of you  Let's look at this look at with his periodic table card. By the way. This is going to get one of these on exam you will have to give it back to me after every exam but I'll show you what it has on it go over the Doc Hammer here cuz I want to use this as a I want to use this to show something else.  So here is the periodic table card. Yes. It's out of focus.  And the cat's got to go there it is now. It's in Focus. Okay, so that's one side of the periodic table card the other side has that on it?  Which are constants up here and then these obviously are chemical our formula chemical equations. And before you freak out, you will know all those chemical equations by the by the end of Kemp 6C will deal with almost none of them, you know, for example these over here.  Are all of thermodynamics these over here are well.  There's some funky ones on here was quantum mechanics formulas. There's all kinds of stuff. But that's not the side. It's interesting side. I want to get to hear is the side. I want to look at so in any given periodic table, what you'll do is you'll see there's a luminum there static number 13. Okay down to low. It is a number in here in this case is 26.98 that number  Can be can be read as either atomic mass units per atom.  atomic mass units per atom  and or you can write it as grams per mole. That won't get into why they're the same number. There's a there's a very good explanation for this but it's not really necessary for you to know. What is important to know. Is it that number on the bottom?  Is the average atomic mass?  For that particular atom in grams per mole and you can see that every one of the elements in the periodic table has that some of them are parentheses the ones we don't use very often but again there radioactive that's why we don't but again, this is where we're going to be getting these numbers from so if we go back over to the ER cuz I might use it again we go back over to to this we can see those number. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say that in one mole.  okay, I'm going to say  When we get home, I'm going to say that in one.  Mall  Abyss  I have two moles of aluminum three moles of sulfur 12 moles of oxygen by take each one of those and X is the molar mass or the atomic mass for each of those aluminum is 26.98 grams per mole of sulfur 32.06 + oxygen 16.00. What I wind up with is that in one mole, okay?  I have that much aluminum.  I have that much sulfur. I have that much oxygen if I add them up.  That now gives me the molar mass for that compounds of the molar mass for that compound is the the molar mass of one mole of the mass of the moles of each of the substances that make it up. So in this case one mole of aluminum sulfate as a molar mass of 3342.14 grams again, here is the same thing for glucose glucose glucose is C6 h-12 o-6 all this table does is kind of gives you the same thing. I've been saying on that it has 6 atoms of carbon-12 atoms of hydrogen 6 atoms of oxygen in terms of moles that 6 moles of atoms of carbon-12 moles of atoms of hydrogen 6 moles of atoms of oxygen.  Again, if I wanted to know the number of atoms of each of those which isn't really important at this point in time I can do I can do this, okay?  The mass of the mass per molecule of the compound we have 72.06 a m Hughes. And if you remember what I said that AMU per molecule is the same as grams per mole. So we have the same number in terms of gram. So when the one mole of glucose contains 70 points 72.06 12.10 and 96.00 grams now because of the law of constant composition  Add because the law of definite proportions.  Any any glucose will always have that ratio. Ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen 72.06 to 12.10 to 96.00 K again what this means is that we can we can talk about this compound in terms of its percent.  composition where the percent composition of carbon is 72.06 divided by 180.16  K grams  grams per mole * 100%  we could do the same thing for hydrogen.  Are we can do the same thing for oxygen?  And that will give us our percent composition and that percent composition is important because that means instead of working with grams. It tells us what percent of each of those atoms of each of those atoms makes up.  Glucose and so if for example, we know that glucose if we know for example that a compound contains 40% carbon no matter what mass of the compound we have.  40% of it will always be carbon if we know that a compound contains 10% sulfur.  We know that regardless of how much of the compound we have 10% of its mass will always be due to Sulphur. Okay? Well at this point you go so well the so what is knowing that allows us to back calculate and determine what the chemical formula is? So if for example, we isolate an unknown compound, if we determine the percent composition of each of the elements in it, we can work our way backwards to its chemical formula. That's what you were doing in lab this this past week.  So again here is one of these summaries where we can take.  The amount total of the compound use the chemical formula to determine the amounts of elements in the compound. So again, this is nothing this is nothing new. This is just something that we're going back into so we can convert atoms to moles to amount in moles. We can turn, Mass.  Into amount in moles and moles is the calculation that you're going to you need to do to do almost all calculations in chemistry almost all calculations, if not all calculations.  That begin with a mass number.  Eventually need to be converted to moles to be able to do something with it because that's how we work. That's how we work our magic with chemical formulas. But we need or chemical equations and chemical formulas. So the central concept is just this we need to be able to take the mass of a substance in converted to the moles or the moles of a substance in converted to the mass almost all chemical calculations are going to rest on this interconversion, which means if you can't do this interconversion  He will fail chemistry miserably.  Because unfortunately, we do a lot of calculations.  General chemistry is full of these calculations now soon enough.  doing molar mass calculations for you is going to be sort of like  breathing because you're going to do it so often it's going to be one of those things.  That is just going to become second nature, but I must warn you.  When I make mistakes on exam keys.  It's always because of something that is as natural to me as falling asleep.  It's easy to make mistakes on these kinds of things.  It's easy to make mistakes on these kind of things when  You're so it's it's like second nature doing it. So it's always good to double-check your calculation on conversion to moles before you go on.  All right. I always put this slide in because this is one of those things that you just you're going to hear it. I think I've said this already but I want to make sure that I have you were going to hear three terms. You're going to hear atomic weight. You're going to hear atomic mass or you're going to hear molecular weight or molecular mass formula weight or formula or formula mass. They all mean the same thing. They're all talking about the mass of one mole of whatever you happen to be talking about. So Tom McMath Tom equate is the mass of one mole of an atom.  Molecular weight molecular mass is the mass of one mole of a molecule.  formula weight formula mass is the molar mass of one mole of a ionic compound usually  They all mean the same thing.  So don't let the terms confuse you and they can be it's a it's a it's a it's a kind of vernacular that has been in chemistry forever. It's not changing. You just need to be used to seeing it.  True mass percent. Well, that's what we can that's what we were just talking about. So  since we can measure mass directly.  And we now know how to convert that to moles. It's a common practice to refer to the mass composition of a compound rather than its Graham composition and that mass percent composition scuse me, when we determine experimentally, and I know and that's because percentage is 1 of those quantities.  That you don't need to know how much you started with.  Percentage is what percent of what you have is a certain element or a certain compound or whatever. Okay, so because of that this could be thought of as an intensive property.  Intrinsic property of a compound a compound has an intrinsic property at its mass composition will always be the same. So that's what we use when we are talking about about compounds element bases. Its simple all it is is the mass of the element.  divided by the mass of the compound that contains that element times a hundred k  usually the way  That you'll see this right now. This will say that.  The percent of X will be equal.  chew  the mass of one mole of x divided by  the mass of one mole  of the compound  that contains X  and that quantity measured by or * 100.  Show given a chemical formula. It's very easy to get the percent composition by doing this. So let's look and see and do this for aluminum sulfate because we've already  Done the calculations for each of the compound for each of the things.  Remember that we said that aluminum sulfate contains?  2 moles of aluminum 3 moles of sulfur in 12 moles of oxygen and so the mass of aluminum in 1 mol and again  Let's be clear about this.  This is  in one mole  Of aluminum sulfate, okay, which has a molar mass. That's equal.  to 342.14 grams  from all that again. We did that calculation earlier. Okay. So what is the mass compas? What is the percent composition? What is the mass composition? Well, the mass percent composition is the amount of aluminum in one mole of aluminum sulfate / the mass of one mole of aluminum sulfate 53.96 / 342.14 multiply that by a hundred we've got 15.77% aluminum same for sulfur we get 28.11% of sulfur.  And do it by offer oxygen we get 56.12% oxygen. So every aluminum sulfate regardless of the amount of aluminum sulfate we have  Regardless of the amount of aluminum sulfate we have it will always be composed of 15.77% aluminum by mass 28.11% sulfur by mass and 56.12% oxygen by Mass.  Okay. That's the easy part. Now. Let's use this to determine chemical formulas. So before we do this, we have to understand that there are two chemical formulas that we need to talk about. What is What's called the empirical formula of empirical the word empirical means experimental chemistry is an empirical science. It was determined through  observation to experiment so the empirical chemical formula is the chemical formula as determined by experiment the experimental determined. Okay. It is the simplest formula for a compound that agrees with the elemental analysis and gives rise to the smallest set of whole numbers of atoms lowest common multiple.  Okay.  It does not mean.  The dad is the actual chemical formula. It's the lowest ratio. For example.  glucose  has an empirical formula  of C.  H2O  one glucose has a carbon to hydrogen oxygen ratio in terms of atoms of 1221. Okay, but  so does ribose  one carbon  two hydrogen's one oxygen in terms of the of the atomic composition or the molar composition as well. Okay, that's the empirical formula noticed and the same empirical formula, but they are not the same compounds that's where the idea of molecular formula comes in. The molecular formula of the compound is the molecular formula as it actually exists in nature. Now most or Simon the most many  molecular compounds  have an empirical formula and a molecular formula.  Almost all ionic compounds with rare exceptions that we won't get into.  Have well, sorry. Rare exception with some exceptions.  Almost all ionic compounds have only an empirical formula.  Chofer glucose the molecular formula is actually six times this so glucose.  has a molecular formula of C6 h-12 o-6  6 ribose  Is C5 h10 o-5 again when you bring that down to the lowest?  I'm whole number ratio you get ch2o.  So what is the difference where all the molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula if a compound has if a compound has a molecular formula it will be.  A multiple of that empirical formula in general we can say this for type one and type two compounds the empirical and molecular formulas are the same. I don't think you'll ever run across a case where that's not true for type 3 compounds and molecular compounds. That's what we usually see a difference but not in all compounds.  We see a difference. That's where we're going to see it, but we don't see it in all compounds.  Now, what do you need to know to be able to tell whether you have the empirical formula or the molecular formula and the answer to that is we need to know the molar mass.  We need to experiment Lee. This is how it's done. By the way, we experimental e determine what the molecular mass of the compound is we compared that to the molecular mass of the empirical formula that we determined.  And from those two numbers we can get the chemical for the molecular formula. So in general if we have an empirical formula units of some of some compound.  ABC where it has x a s y bees and a z sees the molecular formula takes that empirical number of empirical formula units and multiplies it by whatever the subscript is. Okay. Well what are in is equal to is the molar mass of the actual compound / the molar mass of the empirical formula again will see this it will see this in action in a few minutes.  Now the question is how do we get this data? Okay. Well, let's do this from deter by starting by doing determine the empirical formula from the masses of elements. So let's say the elemental analysis of an ionic compound shows.  That it has 2.82 grams of sodium 4.35 G of chlorine and 7.83 grams of oxygen now, we don't need to know the total amount compound we started with but we can get it very easily by adding those numbers up if we added those numbers 2.8 to 4.35 and 7.83 up we get the total mass the mass of the compound was analyzed not the mass of a mole of it. But remember the law of constant composition says that if we know how much of each of those compounds make it up we can work those two moles we can get the molar ratios from that. That's what we're going to do. What we're going to do here is going to take the mass of each element in the compound.  We're going to divide by the molar mass that that funky looking at them. They have up there. I just use mm for molar mass.  We're then going to take the moles of each of the compounds. I'm going to relate those to one another we're going to set it up. So that one of the elements is 1 in ratio everything else against that see that the minute that'll give us the polemon area formula which will change the energy or sub subscripts if necessary to get the empirical formula.  So let's do that. So I'm going to take 2 .82.  Okay.  Tell me to take 2 .82 that's the grams of sodium in the compound.  I'm going to multiply that by something that has grams on the bottom.  Animals on the top. That's why that's the that's one over the molar mass of sodium that converts doing dimensional analysis that converts me to moles of sodium.  I do the same thing for chlorine using the the atomic mass in the Periodic Table of of Corinne.  Okay, I just same thing for oxygen. And so what I get at this point in time is I get that those mass amount that I started with correspond 2.123 moles of sodium Point 123 moles of chlorine and 489 moles of oxygen what we need to do is to get this into a ratio.  And the way we're going to do this is we're going to set one of the elements.  in the chemical formula equal to 1  we're going to stay at one of the elements equal to 1 will make adjustments later on after we do the calculations. If we need to the easiest way to do this is to look at the moles of each of the compound of each of the elements in their take the smallest molar amount and divide that into all of the others. So that's what I'm doing. The smaller. The smallest molar amount is point one two, three. Happens to be into out into comp into compounds or into of the elements. So if I do that the ratio of sodium to chlorine to oxygen is point one, two, three moles / 1 2 3, that's a smallest more amount.  To 1.123 / Point 1234 Corrine. 2.489 / Point 1 2 3 for the oxygen if I do the math what I get is what you see down here.  I get a ratio of 1 2 1 2 3 .98 now since  now since atoms must combine in whole number ratios 3.98. We just round up to four that gives me a chemical formula of naclo4 or in this case sodium perchlorate yet.  But we haven't done that yet.  So can you always round and the answer is no, okay. There were two times you cannot round. They're actually more than that. But there's two that we come across on a regular basis the two times that you cannot round.  And we'll actually see this in a in a number in something here. The two times that you cannot round is when you have a ratio of say for example, 1/2 x point five.  R12x .333 or something like that.  This is where it gets tricky. Now this doesn't this happens a lot with the what are the top 5 at 1 we see all the time. So for example, let's say we get a chemical formula.  Where we have P1?  00 2.5. We can't round when it ends in .5. So what we do is multiply each of the subscripts.  Buy a single number.  That will turn that point 5 into a whole number in this case. What we do is we multiply it by 2 and that will give us P2.  05  and this is one of the common things when you have an an even number and an odd number.  Atoms in something quite often you wind up seeing a point five in it to get rid of the point five since we can't round that we're going to both by each of those. Bye. Bye. Bye to know what if we have something like this one Dex point three. So for example, let's say we have we have S  Oh.  1.3  is another one we can't round out. The reason is the two most common Zar point five in .3 occasionally. We see a .25 but those are rare.  The reason is when we see the point 3 it means that the thing is actually three times more that element that we've said is one is actually three times what we think it is. So did you do this? What we do is we multiply each of the subscripts I3 that gives us ES300.  A 3.9 and that we can round to s304 in this case.  I did my math, right? Okay. Yeah.  But what if what if what did I say in the very beginning? What do we want where we what are the two we run into?  Okay. Can I see any 1.7. If you got 2.7 check your math or something wrong now? Why do I say this? And I'm not being a smaller me about it. What I'm saying is that it's never you never see that now if you started missing guy that you did something really wrong because there ain't you ain't going to get something with that if I happen to get a point now, let me answer her question in a more scientific way if I went into the laboratory and I actually did the experiment multiple times and I got .7 there then I would probably around it up cakes because I have no option on that one. Okay.  Put in the kinds of things you're going to see if you're getting a point seven at 2 usually indicates. That was an experimental error fact, it does indicate. There was an experimental error, okay.  most of the time what you're going to see are things like  .2.  Play 88.9 you going to see that those are Easy near the round down or up when you do run across a .3 and by the way, it's almost never point three. It's usually point three 3.35 something like that. Okay.  When you run across that you're going to wind up doing this kind of stuff. Okay. Now how often does this happen? It doesn't the what are the top point five happens a lot?  Okay that what happens a lot Point 3.3 happens a lot when we're talking about molecular compounds particularly compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen.  Is it common?  It's not as common is .5 but it does show up. I'll see if we have an example of that in the in the notes because I think I do actually.  So here's another one and here where to do it a little bit differently here. You're given the mass percent now, by the way, I could have done the previous Problem by converting those numbers to mass percent and gone this way.  It doesn't matter whether you start with the individual masses of what makes up the compound or the mass percent the mass percent a little nicer because you get bigger numbers and you don't have to worry about sometimes you have to worry about scientific notation. You don't hear so let's look for example at lactic acid lactic acid has a molar mass of 90.08 kg forms in muscle tissue. It's one of the things that's responsible for soreness.  It's Elemental analysis shows that it has 40 mass percent carbon. 6.71% Mass hydrogen mass percent hydrogen and 53.3% mass oxygen now. Let me also warn you something many times when you're given the chemical formula.  Hint next Tuesday.  Oxygen will not be given to you.  But if you know the compound is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen if I give you the carbon in the hydrogen, you can figure the oxygen out because the sum of the percentages has to be equal to a hundred again. It's with percent composition that this happens.  Percent composition for reasons that we won't get into until little bit later oxygen is not often.  Given to you it's because we can determine the other elements easily oxygen is more difficult to determine but we can get it by what's called difference a hundred percent minus percent. Carbon - 2% hydrogen is the percentage of whatever's left over.  So we're going to use those to determine the empirical formula of lactic acid to do this. We have to convert.  The percentage has two masses this turns out to be very easy to do.  Because we know that by the way, it does not matter. So what we need to do is we need to convert these two masses so we can give her them to moles.  Hey, since we know the percentage is out of 100.  Why not use that to our advantage and say let's start with a hundred grams. If I started with a hundred grams of lactic acid, if 40% of that is carbon and it has to be because that's the that's the mass percentage that means of that 100 grams 40 grams is carbon.  App that 106.7 1% of its hydrogen therefore 6.71 grams of that call that hundred grams are hydrogen, etc. Etc. This is  this is what mass percent means and it works very nicely so to do that.  It allow this is going to allow us to convert the mass percent directly to grams. Now you could have used any number other than you can use anything you want instead of a hundred you could have used 2.85 if you want it, but it's more convenient because you don't have to do the initial calculation. Just convert it to the gram. So 40%  40% carbon is 40 G of carbon lactic acid 6.71 G of hydrogen 53.3 G of oxygen. Now. I'm going to do the same thing I did before I'm going to take those Grandma Mouse and convert them to moles. So 40 grams of carbon x 1 mol of carbon for every 12.01 grams of carbon again, that's one over the molar mass.  Is equal 2.3.3 3 moles of carbon do the same thing for Oxford hydrogen hydrogen is 1.008 grams per mole.  it gives me 6.66 moles of hydrogen 53.3 grams of oxygen converting that to moles gives me 3.33 moles of oxygen again when I'm going to set my ratio up so that one of the elements is ratioed as a one when I do that when I get is 3.33 moles of  carbon / 3.33. That's the lowest molar amount there.  to 6.66 moles of hydrogen divided by 3.33  To 3.33 moles of oxygen / 3.33 again. I'm dividing them all by the smallest number of moles. So that gives me an empirical formula of ch2o or c for ch2o. Now the molar mass of this empirical formula. Okay, if I calculate this.  the molar mass of the empirical formula here is 30  .03 grams  Pro Bowl  one carbon  two hydrogen's what oxygen  putting it all together like we did that gives us this, okay?  so the empirical formula but since we were given  The molar mass of lactic acid we need to decide whether or not the empirical formula is the molecular formula.  Remember, we've don't we're not sure at this point in time. So what do we do? We take the molar mass that we were given which was 98.08 grams per mole for lactic acid. And we divided by the molar mass of the empirical formula in this case 30.03 again. This number should be a whole number if it's not.  You're going to round it.  If it's not you're going to round it unless it ends in .5 or it ends in .33. You don't see that very often, but it's possible.  In this case, we got three, which is great. So the actual chemical formula is 3 times each of the elements in the empirical formula or C. 38603 is the molecular formula.  Again, the only time the empirical formula and the molecular formula will be different.  Is if the empirical formulas molar mass and the actual molar mass are different.  again to know this you must be given  the molar mass of the actual compound  So now let's do another example. Let's do this. Tungsten example when 1.853 grams of tungsten is heated in the presence of oxygen 2.095 grams of an oxide of tungsten is obtained determine its chemical formula. So when you first look at this you go well, wait a minute. I'm not giving enough information what you actually are. You're being told how much Tums can you started with and you're being told what the weight of the compound is it the end.  The Compound at the end has both tungsten and oxygen in it.  Okay.  The Compound at the end as both tungsten and oxygen by the way right now you're learning about you know about as much as the Early B students till you'll see this again in 6p except then you won't have to pay attention.  and after reducing next module, you will have finished the first third of six P Okay, so  since this is an oxide of tungsten all the mass in the product that is not due to tungsten has to be due to oxygen so we take  the mass of the tungsten oxide  WX RW Sodexo Supply subtract the amount of tungsten in it, which means that in that point to for 2 grams are due to oxygen so there are two ways to proceed from here.  There are two ways to proceed from here and I'll again.  One of the ways to do it in some people love doing it this way. That's why I put it up here first.  Is to convert directly each of those masses to moles. So 1.853 grams of tungsten / 183.84 grams of tungsten per mole of tungsten gives me 1.01 x 10 to the -2 moles of tungsten do the same thing with oxygen I get 1.51 x 10 to the -2 moles of oxygen again, I take the smaller molar amount in this case the smaller molar amount.  is the tungsten  I divide each of those by that number. I get 1 to 1.5 here is an example where the calculation gives us is .5 like we said X .5 in this get 1.5 in this case, but that's .5 as soon as we see that we know we can't round at we multiply  you multiply each of them by 2. And what do you get you get a ratio of 2 to 3. So the empirical formula for this compound must be w2w sub 203.  k  Or tungsten 3 oxide those of you playing along with nomenclature which by the way, you're going to have to know soon enough.  Okay rainfall this  You better be able to because you have a do on a lab report this week. Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is not very hard is it?  Okay.  okay, if it's hard then  Practice at home a little bit. It's not very hard and yet this is one of the hardest things you're going to have to do.  This quarter in the class.  You can Master this you can Master stoichiometry.  If you can Master Stoichiometry and pretty much the general chemistry sequences learning about energy and other kinds of things which employ a lot of Stoichiometry. It's not that difficult I settle down.  Now if you're sitting there going, oh my God. My life is over. I can't do this. It's just because you haven't done enough problems yet by Friday. When you turn in your post lab questions, you will have done enough of this.  By Tuesday at 9:20. You will have done a lot of this. Okay, I by that time it will become second nature now. I notice you notice I said on this problem.  Notice that I said on this problem.  That there are two paths.  There was a second path and it's actually the one that I like doing myself again, which of the two pads you choose is up to you. Just make sure that when you're showing us your work that you do show us your work the other way to do this is instead of kinetic said of taking the masses and directly can bring the moles convert them to percent composition and then go to moles and why do I recommend this method and I'll tell you why in a moment. So in other words if I do that  I get 1.853 grams of tungsten. / 2.095 * 100 is 88.45% Tungsten for the oxygen doing something similar. I get 11.55% you proceed as discussed before for percent composition again, you get w203 try this on your own at home. But let me explain to you why I like doing it this notice over here on the previous slide noticed that the numbers that we got.  or less than 1  back significantly less than one with scientific notation necessary.  When you do the calculation using the mass percent method you almost never wind up having to use scientific notation. I find that you make less mistakes. If you don't have to use scientific notation if you have numbers that are close to 1.  Either just above or just below I find those to be easier to work with and as it turns out by going to percent composition method that works out very nicely again. It doesn't matter which of the two methods you work.  And you're going to find this as we go as we go on I'm going to talk about some other stuff just a minute as we go on.  Especially in stoichiometry. I'm going to show you multiple ways to do the same problem.  Where do I show you the multiple ways to do the same problem? You should.  You should go home and try both of them. What are the two methods you're going to find to be better for you than the other.  As a result is just more important to practice this stuff and that's and that's it's again. It's how you do things. It's like looking at a glass of water. Is it half-full or half-empty? Well depends on your point under point of view, but you're right. Either way. I will give you multiple ways to solve these problems now, there's another way.  But this compound that this question could have been asked.  The other way to ask this compound this question is to say something like this.  2.095 grams of an oxide of tungsten  was decomposed  to give 1.853 grams of tungsten  What is the chemical formula so there's two ways that these problems can be presented to you one is starting with this much of this element. We made this compound the other way is to take if we have this compound and we decomposed it to get this much of one of the elements. Both ways are ones you will see.  Okay now.  what about  Something that contains more than one element. We've already seen this.  But let's look at this from an experimental standpoint now the next slides on this.  I'm going to discuss them here because I have time but what's going to be going on here is something.  That you may be tested on parts of it, but I'll explain that to you here and I'll swing that to you in a second. So the first one the first slide out here is how do I know?  What the chemical formula of a compound is one of the ways to do with the most common way to do it is to decompose it and the best way to decompose something is the heated up and oxygen.  That gives us what's called a combustion reaction. By the way this formula down here. Just ignore this formula for the time being. It doesn't always I can't remember whether I fixed it or not. Okay.  So here is the trick.  Anytime you have three elements in a in a in something.  The trick is you want to determine what two of them are if you could determine what two of them are the third one you can determined by difference.  if there are four elements in a compound  if there are four elements in a compound, then you have to do a separate chemical experiment to figure out what the 4th element is and how much of it there is so we're about compounds that contain only carbon hydrogen and something else. Okay. Well if we know that in the combustion reaction in a combustion reaction  That everyone sorry that every one mole of carbon will be converted to 1, Mol.  Of carbon dioxide if we know that every one mole of hydrogen will be converted.  to a half a mole  of H2O  or another way to look at it is to say that to moles.  Of hydrogen will give us one mole.  of H2O  if we know that we could determine the carbon and hydrogen in a molecule.  I simply combusting it and measuring how much carbon dioxide there was given off how much water and to do that. We use this apparatus down here something that absorbs water something that absorbs carbon dioxide we can bust our sample and we weigh those tubes that tells us how much of each of those we've got. So if we know, for example how many grams of carbon dioxide we have we can convert the grams of carbon dioxide to moles of carbon dioxide.  Since we know that everyone mole.  A carbon dioxide has one.  Mol of carbon in it.  That will give us the moles of carbon and from that we can convert that to grams of carbon.  if needed  Okay, so this brings up the next slide.  Is a balanced chemical equation always needed?  We haven't talked about balance chemical equations yet. We are going to  if we know  all we really need to know.  Is how the compound on the left of the chemical equation is related to any Compound on the right side of the chemical equation, then we don't need a chemical formula. We don't need a chemical equation. So for example, if we know that every one mole of carbon gives me one mole of carbon dioxide because there's only one mole of carbon in carbon dioxide CO2.  If we know that every one mole of hydrogen.  Are we every two moles of hydrogen gives us one mole of water because there's two hydrogen's in water. We don't need the balanced chemical equation. We have a balance what's known as a story Kia metric relationship between them? Okay. So for example, there's one mole of carbon in one mole of carbon dioxide. There's six moles of carbon in glucose C6 h-12 o-6 there's two moles of Korra of chloride in 1 mol of lead chloride. If we simply need to know the relationship of one element to another we can get that from the chemical formula. These are also these are called what what are the unknown element problems?  Let me see if I have one of these this by the way is a good example. The combustion analysis is a good one to go. I am never going to ask you by the way.  In a combustion, you should go through this one. But what I'm never going to ask you to do in this class, at least I don't think I am I'm not going to give you the carbon dioxide in the water amount asked you to determine the chemical formula from that in other words. I'm not going to give you a combustion data.  In terms of carbon dioxide and water and asked you to determine the chemical formula. But what I would like you to do is go through the last through the last few slides here so that you can see that everything you've learned up to now can the youth now, by the way this slide in the next slides on here actually point out something that you do need to know and that is how do you determine the amount of a third element?  If you know only two of the three elements are present, okay, that's enough. I will post the annotative slides for last week and today on the web for you to study from I'll see you guys on Thursday.
