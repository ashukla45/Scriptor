    "Full Transcript": "Let's get started.  Do I syllabus is down here for anybody that still that still needs them should get the initial pick them up. So I'm going to start off with a a warning that's going to be more of an admonition and anything else the quickest way.  To piss me off or Professor is to not pay attention to things saying lecture or to not pay attention to your email or to not pay attention to announcements on Ted, which a number of you were doing.  Bottom line is this up until yesterday.  That was your last day of all you're just freshmen as far as I'm concerned from here forward if you miss something in an announcement.  You don't do something because your internet went out by the way is BS.  Okay, I am just going to Simply give you I'm just going to not give you credit for whatever you did or didn't do you need to get on top of this kind of stuff and doing things at the last minute is not the way to succeed here. And if you think I'm tough you wait and see what it's going to be like when you get into your second the winter in the Spring quarter in the Spring quarter. Nobody gives you credit. Nobody really cares.  At this point in time. I know you're still getting used to it and I will for example like because this is your first lab coming up tomorrow. And I know it's a little confusing if this is the most confusing classes far as due dates and labs and lecture because it's one of the only classes like at UCSD. There was some leeway. That's why you're going to get you'll see in a minute why you get an announcement saying hey, this is supposed to be done. Make sure you've done this before class starts for the most part.  It's only a few of you and the problem is it's the few of you ruin it for everybody else. And that's something that I want you guys to keep in mind. This is what's going to happen shortly the first homework assignment in mastering chemistry is going to come up and some he's going to say to me and I didn't get a chance to do it up for 2 weeks. Okay, so you can't use that excuse. And by the way, I've been on this campus for 20 years. I know what the internet's like and it doesn't go out that often.  And you know how I know that because of 350 people in this class six people's internet went out.  Okay, I know why I know what you were doing on your computer. You were going back and forth between you a program running in the background you were going back and forth between things how I know I know how to get I don't know why Ted kicks you out. So bottom line is when you sit down to do the safety quiz, don't talk about a minute. Make sure you're ready to do it. If you could don't remember your head ID, if you don't remember your name, that's a problem. But if you don't remember your Ted ID, by the way, your 10 ideas what you used to sign in to Ted whip?  Did case that's a mystery. So the bottom line is, you know those problems if you put your UCSD ID and instead of that you're up so spoiled those are worth no points. So those are not a big deal if you can't do those, but the rest of the quiz is you must have it done by 8 a.m. Tomorrow and I would not be trying to do it at 7:59 a.m. But it has to be done by any other fact if I were you I'd get it done before 5 this afternoon if I could Noah most if you have finished  And that's a good thing but there are number of you and I'm telling you that's one thing Ted doesn't like when people hit that server hard. So make sure that you're on a wired connection if you can and make sure that you're ready to go when you're going to take it. You think I shouldn't take you that long to cook a eye the math package the notes. I was going to bring some paper page to show you. I'll have to postpone this until Tuesday. The math package is not going to be due until Thursday of next week or Friday. I haven't decided which of the two yet, but it will be do one of those two days and I will let you know this weekend. For most of a lot of lot of you are pretty much almost done with an app pack just a few dimensional analysis problems that I know you're struggling with it. We'll talk about here. But the whole thing is most people are pretty much have that down cold already again. I'll talk more about that.  I'm as we go on to tomorrow is lab make sure that you dress appropriately and be prepared and in fact going back over to the laptop, by the way, you can click in using any letter you want today. So if we come over here or if you should have gotten this announcement that said the of the lab this was the first one that I wanted to put up and it's the thing is that I want you to be prepared. So make sure you download the experiment. You read it. You've watched the videos that are in the folder almost every exam almost every lab has some kind of video is so she with with it. Some of them are some of the most of them are relatively short some of them go up to about twenty minutes I think but they're not usually longer than that. Make sure that you do the pre lab quiz. It's called pre lab questions. We call it a quiz, but it's questions.  You've done those that's in the package you bought from the bookstore. Are you bring the experiment the pre lab in the report sheets to your lab on Friday, you're going to record your data directly onto the report sheet. This is something comes up every year those people go get my my report sheets dirty or yeah good. That means that you were they were in the lab with you. Okay. So some people want a copy over the date on to clean sheets know you record your data as it's being collected that you're going to work in groups of three Matias what sign you into groups of three? So in that group of three if it's okay, if one person is recording the data onto their report sheets and then the other two are doing a spell or are helping with the experiment then recorded later on that's perfectly fine. And in fact is suggested but I don't want you to do is record your your data on  Scratch paper and stuff like that and then put it in their record the data as it's being collected.  Remember to have your ta initiate your data page before you leave the lab and this is roughly the same procedure going to do every week. Okay. Now once you're assigned once you're in a group of three people you guys can decide if you want to for example if like this week so and so brings the experiment this week. So and so brings the experiment this week. So and so brings experiment or bring it all yourself. Whatever you want to do is going to be fine. But you do need the experiment there until you start writing procedural outlines. And even then it's a good idea to have a copy of it. Now, some people want to have their laptops or there they can have it on their laptops on their phone on their tablet. If you want to do that, that's fine. However, you spill something on your laptop your phone or your tablet's not my problem.  And you can tell your mom and dad you just destroyed $1,000 piece of technology because you spilled sulfuric acid on it. Okay?  Tablets are cheap car or I should say papers cheaper than a tablet and don't give me this thing about killing trees. OK it's all recycled paper. Anyway to trees are dead already. Alright, so roughly we're going to do this. Now. The other reason I put this up here is because of something that some of you didn't recognize realize but I wanted was your first of all this over here is what's called a navigation bar over here is the navigation bar. You can see all the kinds of things are here know most of you know, this this is where the modules for self-study are. But here's the thing like that. Some people just didn't recognize here are the blank slides for Kim for so what are we go? So if you go in the blank lecture side blank sure slides if it a little bit up you can see each of the modules and you can open you could download. It seems like there it has the downloads for it. You can click those and downloaded you could download them as to  Sure, what UPS sup to you one up is one per page one slide per page to up his two slides per page and you can write your notes on those slides. That's what I recommend you to now starting this afternoon sometime.  The next one down here with says Kim for annotated slides that is going to be populated. Okay, and you'll see here. Now you can see notice. You see it says here. This is a professor of you you said unavailable. Okay, that's because I haven't you can't see that not yet. I am going to upload this week slides on here and then you'll be able to get at them but you won't be able to get at them until probably safter noon sometime. Usually what you'll do is get an announcement in Ted saying hey annotate it's lights are up any annotated slides K. That's what I wanted to show you that any are rotated slides FYI.  What you see here the when it comes up, that is what you see.  Okay. Thank you very much.  So this is what this says there is that's an annotated slide anything you see me right on the slide is an annotated slide.  Alright prelab is do you want to Rydal tomorrow? Make sure that's done. That's the pre lab is always something you're going to wind up turning in but starting next week, you're also be turning in post lab questions. Be sure to go to the lab room that I assigned you now that is on that is in your gray book on Ted. I sent that announcement out not only to the people that only the people who want it now, but the people who are in the class may not have access to it. And I know that there's a number of you have been assigned. You need to see me right after class to get an assignment to a room. If you show up to a room tomorrow that you're not assigned to is a 50-50 chance you're going to get kicked out of that room.  How do you need to make sure you know where you're going down in the morning? It's not so much of a of a big deal the afternoon. I had to move people around because of the balance the labs out. That's why you need to see me before you go to laugh so I can take so I can get you into the lab that yours that I that has room in it. Some Labs have more people in it. Then they're supposed to be that's why I moved that's why I've been moving people around finally. So make sure that you look at that. You should have looked at before you came to class. Is that what the email said? Finally is this after 3 p.m. Today? So worried about 7 people and had Deborah sets for whatever reason after 3 today. If something goes wrong while you're taking the safety quiz, that's the score you get.  Okay, no resets after 3 today if I reset you still lose the Bonus Match 5 bonus points no matter what but today.  If something goes wrong, then you're just out of luck. You're going to feel that you're going to fail and if you fail you're going to get an email. It's going to be very specific about what you have to do. And if you don't do it, you will be thrown out of this class.  And it's do I hate that I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not sorry.  This is the way it is sieg. Heil Hager. Okay, you do what I tell you to do or or you'll have a short tenure at UCSD and I am like a diaper rash won't go away.  Okay, and there's no cream that helps me and trust me you think this is stuff you wait to use that's hope you like let's see what it's like when you get into one of my organic classes so or six see where I have no quarter by the way, so go make sure you click and I'm going to put this thing up by the way to give you one more thing, but I do want to say there is  Two things. I wanted to tell you. First of all be very careful with your emails about clicking links or if you get something that looks like it comes from UCSD where it says you need to click this link because you need to reset your whatever. Okay, that's a phishing scheme. Okay don't click links in emails iOS on clicking IRS link the IRS. Never send you emails they call. Okay actually take that back don't even call. They send you letters in the mail when the only people still do that. Okay, so, please keep that in mind. I'm finally the  Well, that was that that was actually the most people that was actually the most important thing about all of this just be careful of clicking links the phishing schemes at UCSD are going up like nobody's business. And if any if any link you click says Please provide us your password, it's BS to please be very careful of that. I had to stick at all. I've been told my 48 class. I had a student have their entire bank account stolen last year.  Okay shirt before I go on two dimensional analysis and finish up what I wanted to talk to talk to you about. I want to talk something about sickfics. Now. Most of you have been pretty good. Most of you have a pretty good grasp of significant figures. Somebody came. Somebody came in the office the other day and was going through this math problem that I gave you and they said and then they said do I have to  Judy's problems  The way they're written or can I take each number in scientific notation and do it that way and he answered that question is absolutely you can do that. And in fact, it's actually preferable. If you can put the numbers in scientific notation, then do the operations. The reason is by putting the number in scientific notation you automatically know which number is going to limit your significant figures. So there's nothing special about keeping those numbers in like 7840 3.52 to keep it like that put it in scientific notation and then do all the math. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, that's actually pretty smart way to go about doing it. But here's the question du jour that becomes a real issue.  It's something some of you will figure it out in others. I think we're still are still struggling with this. So let's say I have a number and I do you know X.  * y * Z / q and I get this number like 8250 1.7.  But I'm only allowed.  two significant figures  Okay, this is something that comes up a lot K now. I have seen people do this. I have seen people go and say oh, okay 82583  Okay. No, no. Okay anytime you need.  To use have put significant figures in anytime you need to do significant figures on a number that has more.  positive  Placeholders that's what we thought the call thing. We call anything any place a digit is it or is he recalled a placeholder? But so this anytime you have more digits than you're allowed and significant figures what you're going to want to do and I've been across this out cuz somebody will think this is right if I don't  okay, what you do is take this number and convert it.  2 scientific notation. So I'm going to move that one there to their 3 x 10 to the 3 and then if you're allowed to significant figures then this number is going to decide what happened just becomes 8.3.  * 10 to the third  so again  it's  Again, let me just simply say that sometimes it's just easier to convert your final answer to significant figures be part of a scientific notation before you start the how many sig figs am I allowed how many decimal places I am? I allowed I just a little bit easier that way now addition and subtraction a little tricky as far as this kind of stuff goes, but we don't run across that that's more of a of a here's how we do it. I will run across it in the lab and we don't run it across it that much in in lecture materials just so you know, but this is one of those things I want you to keep I want to I want you to keep in mind.  See, that's not where I was. This is what I want. So this is where we stopped last time we talked about the common unit modifiers so-called power prefix para prefixes are used a lot of time because let's say we wanted to compare numbers. Let's say we wanted to compare  3521 Jules  574 jewels and 82976 jewels, let's compare those well because the numbers are so big and so unwieldy sometimes the work with what we simply do is we simply say, all right, if I move this over like that, I'm going to get 3.5 to 1.  X 10 to the 3 and I do this for each of them to three. Okay. So this becomes 0.574 x 10 to the 3 Jewels this one if I move it over 1 2 3 becomes 82.976 x 10 to the 3 how we recognize this is in juuls.  The X 10 to the 3 is the power prefix kilo so that this number here would be 3.5 to 1.  Sheila joules this one is 0.574 kilojoules. And this one over here is 82.976 kilojoules. The reason we do this is because by simplifying the numbers.  I'm making the numbers smaller if you will and keeping them all in the same power prefix. It makes comparisons easier. Okay, by the way, for those of you standing the back their seats over here if you want to if you want to find seats.  Okay makes a comparison easier. Now. There's another reason for using power prefixes. The jewel weed. I just mentioned that you last time is a unit of energy. Okay. So how much energy is a joule and this is a question. You should always ask yourself when we talked about units. How big how big is that? How big is a juul one? Juul, how big is it? How big is a mole number we're going to talk about later on you'll is the amount of energy it takes your heart to beat once.  Okay, it means it is a very small.  unit  Well, we don't deal too often in very small units we tend to deal with things like with thousands of juuls at a time and sometimes tens of thousands of juuls sold to make it more convenient to discuss what it means in the grand scale of things. We start using power prefix of Sao Paulo prefixes are there for a lot of reasons the most important being that lets us get it lets us get away from using the actual scientific notation. It makes comparison.  Of numbers much much easier for some seats down here. If you want to come all the way down the front. I don't buy it anymore.  Their seat over here their seats over there.  Can we use these on a regular basis and it's something let me put it this way in this class. You don't see them that much you will see them but you don't seem as much as you think when you're going to see them in Spades is when you get to Kemp's 6abc and that's where buy if you know them. Well, if you learn the power prefixes now, you'll be much easier when you get to those to discuss their so here is a summary of what I want to say or what I was saying about all of the sig figs in measurements. First thing that you need to always know is that errors occur during scientific measurements regardless of how careful one is obviously the more careful who you are.  The less of an impact errors are going to have but because of the fact that there are indeterminate errors there are random errors because there are things you cannot control errors are going to be there. Okay. So in a laboratory the way we get around errors killing us is by doing multiple experiments multiple runs is what we call them. K letter words do the do the measurement 2 * 3 * 4 time to do a lot of measurements. So we try to do somewhere between two and three measurements in a real depending on how on how  Import the data is we might want to do maybe as many as five different samples.  Significant figures are what allow us to convey the Precision of our many of our measurements to our audience. So if I want if you want to convey to me, just how  Precise measurement is what I mean by that is how precise was the device you used to make the measurement that's communicated to me and significant figures where you report every digit that you're sure of and one only one at the very end that you're not that's where the paralyzed as far as we're concerned.  Constance Wu not truly exact numbers going to be treated as if they were exact numbers in his class. Okay as highly precise versions of almost any constant can be used to be found or can be given so this is something that is a is one of those kind of vague spots some professors will treat Constance as really having a number of sig figs that they that they do but I'll tell you we can always give a constant that has more significant figures if I wanted to look around and give it to you so  Don't let Constance don't let conversion factors in general don't like conversion factors or constant ever limit. The number of sig figs that you're allowed units are as important as the numerical values. Are we just going to come up in the next sand annexed discussion, which is in dimensional analysis, which by the way is a self-study module, but I want to talk a little bit about it here today. This is one of those things. This is one of those things units or something that most students don't really think much about because up to this point in time. You haven't had to think about them.  But now we need to not only be able to communicate the magnitude the value of our measurement what the units of that measurement are so we can be specific but exactly what we measured at exactly what it means as it turns out. So I'm moving forward we're going to go talk about dimensional analysis. Not most of you have already looked at the self study module have already done some of some of the work in it and I know some of you I know some of this stuff that you know how to do but I want to go I want to highlight some of that some of the more important points and try to give you a big General feel for this thing. So this squad dimensional analysis,  To be quite honest with you when I was when I was in college when I was sitting in the seats that you're sitting in at a different College, obviously.  When I was there.  The dimensional analysis was not really anything nobody ever talked about dimensional analysis dimensional analysis with something that started to get developed.  Probably in the I would say probably the the late 70s early 80s notes people have done it forever. Okay, but it finally became a name and it became something that we started teach. It was called the factor label method for a long for a long while and it's based on this if you do enough calculations what you realize pretty quickly is that  Oh, you're basically doing when you take when you do a calculation is taking a value in one set of units and converting it to a value in another set of units.  In some cases it's a straight-up conversion, but in other cases.  There are physical relationships or chemical relationships that were using to make those that conversion. Okay. So what dimensional analysis really says is this if the units of your answer?  Make sense or should I take that back if the units of your answer are correct, if you're starting with kilometers and you go through a series of conversions to get the miles if the units work out.  Then the map will work out as well. So it's an idea the idea behind it is get the units to work and the math will follow. Okay dimensional analysis is a way to analyze and solve problems by using the units are dimensions of the measurement. It's based on a correct assumption that if the units of your answer or write the chances are good your answer is as well. Obviously if you make a mistake in your dimensional analysis, if you make a mistake in canceling you make mistake and putting the numbers in your going to go wrong answer but if you're careful with the units and then your you put the put the correct values in you're not going to have this this kind of a problem if it's also brings up a very important point now that is scratch paper is free.  Okay, you can find usually there's piles of scratch paper by the by just inside the door coming in to where my office is you can find scratch paper all over the place use it.  Okay, go buy some cheap notebook and use it for Scratch paint, but scratch paper is important and especially on exams because scratch paper allows you to look back at what you've been doing.  And see does this make sense does the dimensional analysis workout. Did I do the math correctly? This is why I suggest that when you do online homework problems that you have an online your problem notebook.  Where you actually write the problems down and do them in there before with the answer. Okay. The bottom line is the quicker you get used to doing that.  The less likely you are to make a problem. I can give it to you in very in very real terms for all of you. I give a lot when I teach chemistry 6B and sexy I get a lot of seas a lot of seas.  And it's not because the students don't know the chemistry. It's because they screwed up the algebra because they're not using scratch paper. I have seen students go from locey's to A's on exams just by increasing their use of scratch paper the more write things down the more you get in the habit of writing things down and you unfortunately are in one of these Journal generation.  Where everything is electronic?  Okay, and you know what paper and pencil still to this day doesn't require a battery.  Errand and it's something you can always go back and review. It's it's one of those kind of it's one of these skills. You're going to have to rebuild.  You're going to find that you're going to be able to think better when you write things down. Okay, that's one of the reasons I don't let you bring computers into my office. I want you to write the prongs on I have made students write the problem down in front of me.  Only to find 2/3 of the way riding the problem they go. Oh I know how to do this.  And you know, why because they're forcing because they're being forced to look at the problem to retube processing up here and then process it on paper that somebody told me years and years ago you think roughly at 600 words a minute?  You can talk at roughly 200 words a minute.  You can only write at roughly 60 words a minute.  So if you write things down, what does it do? The first thing it does is it slows down?  Your thinking process?  And sometimes just slowing down. The thinking process is enough.  For you to see what to do next. Okay, and that's something that that's the you hear me say this again and again so important skill to to develop, okay?  You use the units to solve the problem is you put the numbers in the math in at the end.  Dimensional analysis quite often requires the use of conversion factors in conversion factors, which are also called equivalent statements allow us to convert from one type of units to another. So for example an equivalence we can have an equivalence Factor where for example 1 lb is equal to 16. Oz we can have a an equivalence Factor where  Bless you a thousand m m is equal to 1 meter.  K C's equivalent factors are going to allow you to convert between units between pounds and ounces between millimeters and meters.  Rarely, will you ever have to go on to Google to find a conversion factor? In fact. Exams I give them to you I give you I don't give you all of them, but I give you the key ones like how many feet is a mile?  How many feet is a mile as my five thousand and change K, but I expect everybody in here knows how many inches are in a foot.  Well, okay how many centimeters are in an inch?  2.54  how many centimeters are in a meter?  100 how many?  Millimeters are in a meter.  So what we've just been able to do is to take miles and convert them into millimeters.  Because with the exception of the one conversion factor that yours no way you're going to know or should know at least is miles to feet but everything else and that's what we try to do. We try to get things into common units. It means sometimes that will have long strings of dimensional analysis. But who cares?  Okay.  So you're a conversion factor. So for example, these are comes from equivalent statements. They can come they can be in the written form that you have to put into a mathematical form or they can be given to you another in another way. So for example, one foot is 12in. So one foot is 12 in putting that down here.  There is one foot is 12 as an equivalent statement. It can be written like this but also as an equivalent statement, you could write it like that as well 12 in / 1 foot by 1 foot per 12in so weak women statements can be written verbally or like this written out they can be put as an equal sign between the two but the most common way they're done they're used to put them into these as equivalent ratios. There are 15125 bolts in a Saturn Vue. So 1 Saturn Vue and that should be both by the way is that many is equal to that many bolts.  One mole of carbon you don't know what I'm old is yet, but we'll talk about that's a good that chemical that's a unit is equal to 12.01 G of carbon and one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter. By the way. This is a conversion factor you need and you should memorize this one here.  That was gross.  That's one that you should memorize that's one of these ones does it you see it all the time.  But unfortunately, it's really written down. I saw you see cubic centimeters to milliliters be moved back and forth all the time, but it's one of the ones that people will forget. So this is one you do you want remember you need us for the for the math assignment 2 in a conversion factor, when what appears by itself in an equivalent statement or ratio? The one is always an exact number and in general both parts of the both parts of the equivalence statement. Both parts of the conversion factor usually considered to be exact numbers. The reason I have to put the reason I had to put that on there but one is considered to be an exact number is that the one will never limit the number of significant figures do not let conversion factors. Do not let these equivalent statements. Don't let  Limit, your number of significant figures sometimes conversion factors are given but sometimes they have to be extracted from the wording of the problem. We'll see one of those as we go on Ellen stop. It is a good idea to get in the habit of looking at a problem and writing down exactly what that problem is saying.  in mathematical terms what's equal to what a lot of times that's simply gives you a complete view of what you need to find and what you have so  4 unit conversions in the same measurement system like SI metric or English that stuff conversion factors that Define quantities and therefore have unlimited significant figures 2. Nanometers is equal to x + 2 - centimeters. Those are exact numbers. They will not limit your number your sig figs 16. Oz is 1 pound that's in English that's in the s in the English system. We don't use that but I put it up here as an example. Those are exact numbers for unit conversions between different systems. The conversion factors are measured values and do have SigFig limits. That's quite often why we don't use them why we don't use meters to miles conversion factor that what are the reasons for not using it is because of the fact that that conversion factor is not the measured value.  There is one exception and that is one inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. This is an exact conversion against again determined by by convention and that is an exact conversion. And that's why a lot of times you see very large distance conversions.  Always being converted to inches and then the centimeters and then to whatever or you see them being converted from centimeters to inches and then to whatever simply because we want all of our conversion factors to be exact numbers.  Equivalent statements are always have the following a relationship that a big number of a small unit is equal to a small number of a big unit. So for example, 1000 mm millimeter being a small unit is equal to one meter a bigger unit much bigger unit than a than a millimeter 6.022 * 10 to the 23rd atoms is equal to one mole. This is also a number that you should memorize this is what we this is a number that we're going to call in a little bit. I'm going to call this thing Avogadro's number.  k  Now that's a huge number.  That is a huge number.  Okay.  You have no idea how huge it is, but I'll give you one.  You know, what a. A book looks like if you were to put if you don't then that's sad, but if you were to put a mole of periods next to one another wooden Circle the Milky Way galaxy here is a fun thing for you to go home and do which is another way of saying if you don't do it has a chance of showing up on a test, by the way, when a professor says you should go home and do this on your own.  You better because there's a good chance of a show up on a test and then guess who's going to be?  Unhappy on the test. Here's one. Let's say that your aunt never mind the physical size of of what a mole is. Let's say your aunt has been collecting pennies for a long time and maybe before that and let's say that your aunt has 1/4.  I'm a mole of pennies.  GameStop, I want you to get home. So if you have 1/4 of a mole of pennies, okay?  How many years?  Let's not say could.  What that last?  you spent  $50,000  a second  Okay.  I want to do this a more quarter corner of them all if you want to spend.  $50,000 8-second how long?  Could you do that with that quarter mole? And I guarantee you that you'll be shocked when you see the number, okay?  If somebody said I'd give you a tenth of a mole, I'd say give it to me.  Okay.  back over to here  one other thing of some of you figured this out. This is I think it's actually in me. It's actually in that the reading and stuff and that is once you have an equivalent statement. Once you have a equivalence ratio what you have a conversion factor,  You can do things that conversion factor like divided in half cubed Square it take the square root, whatever you want as long as whatever you do.  To the conversion factor you do to every part of the conversion factor that will let you get at new conversion factor. So for example, let's say that I wanted to be able to take  cubic inches  Let's say that I wanted to take.  cubic inches and convert it  2 cubic centimeters but off the top of your head. You don't know any conversion that does that but what you do know, is that one inch  is equal to a 2.54 centimeters, so it should make sense to you that if you were to take one inch and Cube that  As long as you did the same thing.  To the other side of the equation.  You should be able to make a new conversion factor that allows you to do cubic inches to cubic centimeters. In fact, that's exactly true. The one thing that you have to make sure that you do and this is why I put this on here. Is that when?  You Cube the unit you must or Star whatever you do to the unit. You must make sure you do it to the value of that unit as well. So for example cubing 2.54 cm.  Means you have to cube not only the centimeter but you have to keep the 2.54. So when I do that, I get 16.4 cubic centimeters per cubic inch now if I go to 15 and 15 cubic inches, I can X this conversion factor and notice that the units on the in the numerator here.  Cancel the units in the denominator there meaning that my units are going to be cubic centimeters. Which means as long as I put the correct numbers in.  I'm going to be okay.  Choke conversion factors does conversion factors allow us to convert one measurement in a given set of units to another measure measurement in another set of units conversion factors can be also derive from physical properties and fact, this is quite often one of the ones that we use. So for example, for example, the density of mercury is 13.55 grams per cubic centimeter, which means converting this into a conversion factor. It means that for every 13.55 grams of Mercury.  We have one cubic centimeter of Mercury.  show  You can take those units. Typically when you do this, one of the units is going to be one is always going to be at 1.  and so units are physical qualities can be done is the heat of vaporization is of mercury is 59.23 kilojoules per mole, which you could write a saying that the heat of vaporization of mercury is that  But the heat of vaporization for this is that for every 59.23 kilojoules. You're going to be able to vaporize one more.  a Mercury  So Physical constants  always are also things that can be used as converge as these sorts of things which is a constant known as Planck's constant is 6.626. * 70 - 34 Jewels Jewels Jewels seconds. Now, this is  Another one of those another one of these units or another one of these things that has Eunice but it has multiple units in it. So it can be used to convert a per second to joules etcetera etcetera a conversion factors drive from physical or chemical properties are considered measured quantities. And therefore you have significant figures. It's therefore important to use the most precise value can find when using them and apply the Sig fig rules as needed. This is one of the things this is my bear not constancies are measured values and having said that I won't usually why almost always give you the I always usually give you these things with enough significant figures if they know that they do not impact your calculation, but you do have to pay attention to physical quantities because they can impact the number of sig figs that you're allowed.  Constance also have significant figures. But again, we're going to treat those as if they were exact numbers because they usually can be found with very high Precision. For example H. And this I actually cut this down age is 6.6 to 60755 * 10 to the - 34 that's more significant figures in your ever going to need.  But instead of using that whole big one. Typically we write it down as 6.626 * 10 - 34 just because we don't always need all those things. We don't need the value that accurately so because we can always find a more accurate value for R constants. We quite often just simply put them down like this again. We're going to treat costs as if they were as if they were exact numbers.  So how do we do dimensional analysis? What's the how to on this was if you take me enough you'll see this in this class. And if you ever take me for other classes, you'll see I have a lot of these how to slides is the steppers. We called Miss steppers. This is a 7 stepper and  the last part of this of this last thing on a slide is something you always need to keep in mind and it no matter what class you're in no matter what kind of problem you're doing number 7 is something you always have to do but let's go to this site step-by-step. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a conversion path. What do we have? What do we need? And then what do we know? What conversions do we know?  Are there conversions that we don't know that we're going to have to look up.  What equivalent ratios are needed now? This is going to be we're going to figure this one out. Once we get our conversion path. We're going to put the conversion string together. We're going to adjust and cancel units is called for another work. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to set the units up. So make sure they cancel so that our answer has the correct units.  We're then going to put the actual numerical values in.  Once we know the units work out then we're going to do the math carefully. Now, that's something that goes without saying you don't do the math carefully. Then why go through all the other steps, but number seven is something that 90% of you don't do and I hope that you're going to learn how to do it.  That is always have to look at the answer now granted on the math assignment that you're doing for me. This is not as important as it should say it's important but it's not as important as later on does the answer make sense and by that what I mean is is the magnitude the order of 10 of the unit of it. Does that make sense does the sign that becomes very important does the sign of the calculation make sense? Is it a negative value? Is it a positive value and oh, by the way in chemistry negative values and positive values have very important meanings.  And so knowing the sign of what you're talking about is really important. This idea of does the answer make sense is something that you need to develop as you go through science.  There's nothing worse than getting a value and just looking at it and say y'all good that's my answer without thinking about what it really means. I have a student calculate how much energy  It would take to heat a cup of coffee up.  keep  300ml of coffee from room temperature 25\u00b0 C  280 degrees C  And the student came back with an answer. It was something like  10000 kilojoules K which is roughly the output of a small star actually was bigger than 10,000. It was some number that was like astronomically. I mean I was like what a star puts out. And I said does that answer make sense to you and they go why did the math?  Okay, I did the math trust me. If you went into the store to buy a Snickers bar, you put that Snickers bar in the counter and the and the guy rang it up on the register and says $20. Are you going to sit there and take $20 and headed out to know? I hope not. Well, if you do come to my store you're going to say to them. Oh, wait a minute.  I think you made a mistake. And so you always have to look at the answer and ask yourself doesn't make sense. And if it doesn't make sense go back and check your mouth go back and check everything. Okay, so  Here is dimensional analysis example number one.  Cats want to look at something real quick. Now. This is a much. This is a more complicated one or not. I should say the next to one of the next life a little more complicated. So rumors 12 inches. How long is it in meters knowing that 1 inch 2.54 CM will the conversion path we're going to go on a go is inches to meters above our heads. We don't know what that conversion is. So now we say well, what is the path we're going to want to do. Well, what do we know we know inches or we need to know is inches to meters but what we what we want to do I should say what do we know we know inches to centimeters. We also know centimeters to meters 1 inches equal to 2.54 centimeters is 1 centimeter or a hundred CM9. What we do is we put the conversion string together and the where we're going to do this way we outline this.  Is like this we say okay. I need something inches here. I need to multiply it by something that has inches on the bottom.  And centimeters on the top.  That way the inches cancel the inches, then I need to multiply that something by something it at centimeters on the bottom and meters on the top that way the centimeters canceled centimeters and my meters which is the only last unit standing is going to be the answer. That's what I've done down below once I've set up my conversion string I can now put those statements together.  Kayaking output those statements together and I can go from there. And in fact, that's what I've just done here. By the way a few in the slides do have in correct number of sig figs on there was one in particular that I just keep forgetting change. If you think it has the wrong number of sig figs come by my office and asked me just to be sure but there are one or two slides in the padding in the stuff that you've done. They're the wrong number of sig figs. So, okay, that's a piece of cake cake now here.  Here's a problem.  K1 that you could see on a test for example Jules Verne wrote a book 20000 Leagues Under the Sea how far is this in feet now? This is one unfortunately.  that  there are almost no conversions here. You're going to know until you get to inches to centimeter somehow. So we got to figure out first of all what on Earth is a Fab and this is the problem is a lot of uncommon conversions. So 1 League you have to look this thing up gold. What is one League? What league is 3 nautical miles will first of all a nautical mile is not a mile not necessarily. So what is a nautical mile and a nautical mile is 10 cable lengths that helps. Okay. What is a cable length one cable length is equal to 100 fathoms.  So I can look this thing up pizza. Okay. So now you're at a hundred fathoms. Okay, finally you get a fathom and you find out that one of them is 6 feet now you're at a unit, you know, okay. So what is the conversion path? The conversion path we eventually need to do is we need to get  Too by the way on a test. I would give you a lead to nautical miles nautical miles to cablelynx cablelynx the fathoms and fathoms to feet and then I would stop giving you after that because I feel that you should be able to do it. So and I don't expect you to know what a fathom is. I don't expect you to know. What a Allegiance. Okay, so set up a conversion factor. What will you need to find League defeat so  First of all, let's use our conversion. First one is there is one  week will be three nautical miles. That's what I put 12313 up there. Nautical miles is 1 nautical mile for every 10. Cablelynx. Cablelynx albums.  Okay, that's a hundred to one hundred.  100 fathoms for everyone cablelynx and then finally six feet six feet per fathom now put it together.  And here is my string again. I'm going to start by putting I'm going to start by putting in.  Leagues here. I'm going to multiply a bite by something that has leaves on the bottom and nautical miles on the top so that the League's cancel that I'm going to multiply that by something as nautical miles on the bottom and nautical miles on the top.  Multiply that by something that has cablelynx on the bottom and fathoms on the top finally something that has fathoms on the top and feet on Adams on the bottom and feed on the top again. My answer is in feet.  k  And so now put the numbers in 20000 Leagues.  By the way, that has one significant figure in it.  3 nautical mile for League 10. Cablelynx per nautical mile 100000 per cable length 6 speed for 5 and means that 20000 Leagues.  Is 4 x 10 to the 8th feet?  Now go home and figure out how many miles it is.  Okay.  It's a lot of miles a lot of miles.  And then ask yourself is the earth that wide.  I'm a problem or acai here's an example of yours additional analysis example, that's more chemistry like and this is one where we're giving a statement and we need to we need to call out of that statement all of the oldest conversion factors we need  0.032 molar solution of HCL hydrochloric acid has a density of 1.17. Okay. How many milliliters do you need to measure out to ensure that the volume you have contains 7.0 grams of HCL now there's a there's an issue here and it's something you always need to be able to be aware of. Okay here you actually faced with three problems of value with no given units. The units are understood because we know what the units of density r k 1.17 a unit you may or may not know the meaning of more.  Okay, and this case too much information that's very common in this case. The molarity doesn't matter.  That is a statement that 8.032 molar solution of HCL has that density that may or may not just because you're given the information doesn't mean you're going to need all of it. Okay. So what do we need? Okay. Well, first of all, the question that were at we're being asked is this one  we want to take  grams of HCL  and convert it to milliliters of 0.032 molar.  8 CL that's what we're trying. That's what we're trying to do. Okay, and here is peace number one.  Anytime you see a conversion where you're taking a mass and converting it to a volume. It's going to involve a density.  Anytime you're taking a mass and converting it to a volume. It's going to require using a density. So what is the approach? What do we need? We need the volume of HCL that contains 7 G of HCL. What do we know? We know the density of the solution 1.17 grams per milliliter and you know what we were looking for Graham's we know grams. We want milliliter. So we already have everything we need so the molarity that molar that? Do we really need it will know we have all the information. We need all ready to do this problem.  Okay. So again set up a string.  Converting with what starting this time with what you need. So here what we need.  Or shall we have our grams or what? We what we need is grams of HCL 7 grams how many milliliters so we're going to take the grams of HCL and convert those to milliliters again. We're going to wind up with a conversion string.  It looks like this grams of HCL. We're going to multiply that by something that has grams of HCL on the bottom and milliliters of HCL in the top. The grams are going to cancel the grand that's going to give us milliliters.  We recognized immediately to grams that mass divided by volume is density.  And so now we can go back and say all right, great. We're going to use the density. Remember that volume divided by mass is nothing more than one over the density.  As long as you know what the equivalent statement is, you can put the numbers in the right place to put the conversion string together 7.0 grams of HCL needed for everyone. We have 1.17 grams of HCL which by the way is the density inverted.  That means we need 5.98 or 6.0 meals to 2 significant figures that again the amount of sig figs lit are limited by the amount that we started with.  The multi-step problems are more core on for more complicated dimensional analysis before I do that. I want to kind of go through a quick one that you have to do in the most you can do that. Let's say that I had  Miles per hour and I needed to convert that.  into kilometers  Per second. Okay. Now when you first look at this problem.  you recognize if there's two units that need to be converted kilometers or miles to kilometers and then  how I'm hours to seconds  When you're faced with a problem like that, what you do is you do one set of units at a time. Okay, so here we would start by going.  Miles per hour. We would convert miles to operate hour to feet per hour.  We would then convert feet per hour.  2 inches per hour  inches per hour  2 centimeters per hour  centimeters per hour to meters per hour and then finally  from meters to kilometers per hour. Okay. So now I have this value.  I have completely done my conversion of my top unit. And again here I would I would convert this by something that has miles on the bottom and feed on the top here. I would convert this by something as inches on the bottom on the top and feet on the bottom here. I would have something it at inches on the bottom and centimeters on the top. Etcetera Etc. Okay, once I've got this I take this number over here.  The one I just calculated in one set and now I take my kilometers per hour to kilometers have been converted and now I convert that to kilometers for example kilometers to minutes.  and that eventually  I'm sorry kilometers per minute and then eventually kilometers per second. So when you have to do not only the top but the bottom do it in two steps.  And by the way, if you don't want to use a string of conversions, if you want to do each conversion one at a time and then another what you wanted you don't want to string them together. That's fine K you what's more comfortable for you? Eventually, you're going to get good enough to be able to string to be able to string them together. So let's take a real complicated how much more complicated problem so let's say  that  He's usually involve complex units values are expressed as ratio where the units are understood like gas mileage. We understand what gas mileage is okay miles per gallon K density grams per milliliter speed miles per hour kilometers per hour or something like that. So what's the strategy the strategy is to solve the problem by breaking their Solutions in the steps and convert the complex units using dimensional analysis.  You do complicated tasks everyday. Okay, for example, if you have to clean a car and I'm not saying about I'm saying you have to clean your dad's car. And if you don't clean your dad's car, right you don't get your allowance. And if you don't have your allowance no video games no video games. You don't get to see your girlfriend or boyfriend. So you're going to do it. Right? How do you do it? You vacuum the inside of the car you wash the exterior dry the exterior and then you apply a coat of wax. That's how you would do it if you were doing my car. Okay. So let's look at this problem and I'm not going to go through this. I'm going to start with them and start by talking about this prom and we'll do it next time. So you're driving or sports car to Tahoe at an average speed of 68 miles per hour.  After 250 minutes you decide to stop for lunch. How many kilometers have you driven in his time and how much money have you spent on gas to drive this distance your car gets 32 miles per gallon and gas cost $0.82 per liter. What we're going to do next time as we're going to go through and we're going to break this problem down so you can see exactly how it's solved. All right folks and then click in make sure you do I will see you all on  I'll see some of you tomorrow but most of you I will see on Tuesday. Okay, one last thing remember if you didn't pass the safety quiz.  Look for an email.  tomorrow  Yeah, what's up?  UC San Diego podcast "
