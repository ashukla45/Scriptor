    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  All right, let's get started.  so  we will do a performance question in just a little bit right now. You can just click in with any letter you want.  So I'm to start with them one is Tuesday this coming Tuesday. I'll be here. It starts at 8 a.m. Actually will try to get going a little bit before that. But since I started as close to 8 a.m. As we can on either side you need to be here by about 7:45 so we can get you seated again if your hair between 745 750 what's the schedule in and seated as quickly as we can so we can pass exams out. There is one thing you need to know and that is that the minute someone leaves the exam. No one will be allowed to take the exam from that point on. So if you're late and someone is already left you won't be able to take the exam. So that's not usually an issue so much it how it is in some classes. But again Kim for doesn't usually have that that problem, but I want to make sure you knew the policy.  The example cover everything up to and including all be covered on Tuesday, which means empirical formula material is fair game, but the stuff I talked about today is not that is we're talking about. Solution to the first enter module today, which is related to the experiment that you're doing on. What you doing on Friday. So make sure you know how to do all that material anything that I've talked about in class requires calculations is something you should know how to do because I guarantee you're going to see something like that in one way shape or form if you don't see it on it on midterm 1 you will see it on midterm to were the final exam.  Don't need to get a class hearing us as well.  homework notes are did I say that last time I keep up with the homework again if the due date comes and it and and  If the due date comes in like for example, if they didn't do one or two Proms and it says all promise not complete. It's past due. That's just the way mastering chemistry takes care of things. I recommend to all of you that you do that you do problems everyday or every other day and that you you don't have to do them all at the same time just do some in short bits. And so at least if you forget a deadline that you got some work up there. I'm there's no sun will come to me and say why printed everything off and then the deadline passing a chance to put it to put my answers in you know, what my answer to that is tough bananas you need to keep on top of this kind of stuff and it's just going to get worse as you move the general chemistry sequence. You were right across peep. I guarantee you you run across people in general chemistry sequence who are going to be a lot nicer than I am.  But you are also going to run into people in general chemistry sequence that are even tougher than I am as far as that kind of stuff goes and what you get to organic if you get organic, it's even worse in organic we hold no, we hold no prisoners shoot to kill a sort of the order of the day. So you need to be on top of your game. And for all of you what that means right now is learning study habits in the end. That's really would Kim for really the biggest problem. I had with Kim for students is to thinks first. They don't pay attention. OK know how many times I tell you that follow-up questions need to be turned in with the lab and post lab questions. YouTube eternity r t a i still wind up getting emails about it. That's number one. The second thing with Kim for is study habits, and I know you all came from high school last year almost  You have rice last year your senior year was a joke.  K I mean come on that bullshyt me I know it okay for your teachers, especially in a second half or like you know, and let's watch a movie. Okay, you don't come on if I had my way your senior year of college would our senior year of high school. If you're going to University would be spent taking half of your classes at the community college if I had my way so thankfully I don't but by that time if you take one course semester at Community College you ready to go anywhere because there again they lay down the law of this is how it's going to be and you and you're not coming into the college expecting expecting it to be high school. It's just not now. Here's something what is the one color that you never ever ever do anything in in this class or Nanny class?  Good and yet some.  person  German title lab report in red if you do a lab report in red guess what your score is 0  Joseph just ask yourself. Will he change it know what color do you think we usually grade read?  They do not do reports in red. Don't do it on an exam. There's always some moron in here who is going to think he'll be cute and I'll do it on my exam and then when I get a zero.  People go to the university and they'll say give me a joke cuz I didn't read and after they stopped laughing.  Don't just tell you why would you do a test in red now? I know some of you love red cool, we're closer red. Okay green after I know I've seen people do things in green. I don't like it. I mean, but hey in the real world you do everything in blue and black. Okay, so, please keep that in mind going to give remember that as far as answering questions on lab reports and what-have-you that could all be done in pencil. If you want. The only thing that has to be done in pan is is taking data. This week's experiment is called the Blue food coloring experiment and that's what I'm going to get you here in a minute with this when I talked about in our module. So what you're going to do, what you going to do is you're going to get a changes from year to year. But for example, one thing it's gone from every year is that you'll get grape cool.  And you're not supposed to drink it. Okay, you'll get grape Kool-Aid and you're going to determine how much blue food coloring is present in blue. Kool Aid you're going to get tropical punch. Somebody's tropical punch some sports drinks or or Gatorade and you going to find out how much blue food coloring is in that what you're going to find out is that they have blue food coloring in them. And the way you're going to do this is to use something called a calibration curve this the first time you've been lucky up to this point in time is that you could be sloppy in things that you did and still get data that was usable in this experiment. If you screw up the calibration curve, you will get a low score on the web know. What is a calibration curve a calibration curve.  And you'll do a number of these by the time you are a college. You'll do a little do a lot of these things. So what is the calibration curve?  First of all, it's usually not a curve. Okay Kirby just another term we use for a plot. Okay. So what a calibration curve does is it plots?  and a known  quantity  versus  a measured  quantity game  So what it means is we're going to take some sample.  That we know something absolutely about in this case is going to be concentration is going to be the concentration of the blue food coloring. Okay. They're going to have burette set up you're going to take X milliliters of of the it's in the experiment TX milliliters of a jerk and diluted up in a volumetric flask. Talk about in just a moment and then you can mix it up and then you going to measure it and you're going to know the concentration of the blue food coloring you're going to plotted against.  A measurement that you're going to take on an instrument called a spec 20 and when all is said and done you're going to wind up with a you're going to wind up coming up with a curve where you going to plot?  Excuse me, and I don't remember offhand. I think I believe the way we do, this is excuse me. We have you plot absorbance versus  There's a reason for doing it this way. I'm absorbance vs. Concentration now getting what kind of a concentration in the minute.  Okay, and it's a some years. I've had people V. Are you guys blind percent transmittance against it? Basically what you're doing is your measuring given a known amount of blue food coloring how much light does it absorb? Okay. Now. All things absorb light. Well, that's not really true. But this but things that are colored pick up light. They absorb light they absorb light of a certain wavelength. And so if we plot that that limit light that's absorbed or transmitted versus the concentration what we get.  Is a curve.  again, I'm going to try to draw this so it looks like  my try to draw this so that we go that's better.  Little hard to do it here where we put the concentration down here and the concentrate tration is generally plotted in molars.  Which is moles.  Per leader. Can we talk about this in a minute? And you're going to block that versus absorbance?  And so what you're going to get when all is said and done as you're going to get something?  It looks like this and then what you're going to do and this by the way is an experiment where you can plot using Excel if you want even though I do want you to at least try at least one hand plot on this what you're going to do is you're going to you're going to draw a line.  The best straight line you can through those points.  Know where you're going to do what's called a linear regression fit.  Three squares linear regression fit on this thing. Okay from this.  For those of you don't remember what you're going to be able to do here is an again. You'll have to review how what you can do with a line. But once you have this for the nones, what you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to take  An unknown, let's say your unknown has an absorbance here. You're going to be able to take that unknown.  over to this line  and then from there you're going to be able to drop.  Down to there and get the concentration. So the idea of a calibration curve as you used these known samples with their known concentrations. You measure these values then what you do is you take an unknown measure its dies. There's plenty of seats in here folks with those of you sitting in the back you measure its  Absorbance and then take it all down to the line. There's another way to do this and that's you can actually if you do this in Excel, you can actually generate an equation of this linear of this at least of his least-squares linear regression fit line. And in this case, what you're going to wind up with is going to wind up with an equation. It's going it's going to be something like this that absorbance is going to be equal.  to the slope  time's the concentration  Air Max Plus  the y intercept  so you can actually generate this you can actually actually one of the ways best ways to do. This is to actually generate this equation off of your graph either by graphing it by hand or by or by using Excel again graphs must be full page or you want them as big as you can't do this either of these ways you're going to be able to take now you'll be able to take absorbance and take that absorbance and men put it in this equation and solve for concentration given that you can get the rest of this date off the line which will be able to do and this is exactly how  We do analytical data work. For example, if they take a sample of your blood for example in there looking for somebody do a little bit differently for different things. But in general it's the same idea. They take a sample.  From you or a sample and what they do is they measure some value on it and they use that value plug it into a concentration curve.  Does something like this a calibration curve? Excuse me, a calibration curve to find out the value they're looking for. Okay. Now what is this mean for you guys? It means that if you mess this calibration curve up.  Everybody in your groups data is going to be bad.  And guess what?  There's only going to be four groups per lap, which means each group still have a lot of people in it. So when you get together each ecobee by batch, so when you get together to do the calibration curve middle words could be one calibration curve for instrument. It is a good idea that you work in what I like to call partners.  The one person who's measuring the stuff out and the other person who's making sure they do it, right?  Okay.  Because you can't screw this up. Okay. Now it's another thing that we're going to use call the volumetric flask. I'll put this on the board volumetric flask is something you haven't used yet. I don't think you have.  A volumetric flask is a flask. That is known as a TC.  Bessel TC means to contain a burette the other thing you're going to use at a pipette.  And the pipettes you've used are what are called TD TD stands for to deliver.  And so something that is a TD and it actually says it on the piece of glassware something it is TD to deliver is meant to deliver whatever that piece of equipment says. It's delivering. So if the piece of equipment says it delivers 1.00 mil, it delivers 1.00 Mills now it's been calibrated to take into account liquid sticking on the inside. What have you even then we have to recalibrate those things occasionally. Okay glassware TC is set up meaning to contain whatever it says, it will not deliver what it says. So a 100  milliliter  volumetric flask is  100.00  plus or minus in it depends on depends a lot on the depends on the on the piece of equipment a plus or minus two to 5% sadist by persons of high pens on how good the equipment they give you is usually says it on it, but we assume that it's 100 .00 know how do we know this in a volumetric flask in a volumetric flask looks like this.  Sort of okay usually has a very long neck fat bottom K and then somewhere on it.  Is an etched.  line  and that etched line indicates the point.  At which exactly you got 100 ml in there.  You cannot go over this line and then take stuff out.  Because if you do you're going to be taking out some of whatever you put in there in the first place. So the first thing you'll do is put some blue food coloring in here and then you'll fill this thing up with water until it gets just below that line.  And then using a dropper what you'll do is put water in until the meniscus.  Just touches the bottom of the bottom of the meniscus just touches that line at that point in time you out exactly 100ml now you mix it up.  And you're good to go.  Once you've mixed it up if you spill some who cares.  Because of the fact it doesn't matter anymore in a to deliver if you spill anything in a to deliver, you have to start again in a TC. Once you made it up to that line and mixed. It doesn't matter if you spill it we don't want you to but it doesn't matter because you've already sent its concentration exactly where you want to do it. Okay. No one thing that you're going to have to do and be very careful about is rinsing everything tomorrow blue food coloring. You have to get we're going to use the same volumetric flask to make a whole mess of dilutions and we'll talk about dilutions in a little bit.  You have to rinse it out if you rinse it out with DIY water or distilled water.  K distilled water by the way, for those of you don't know and we'll say this again there two types of water in a lap. Okay, there is what's called lab water.  good for bathing  and then there's what's called d i  or  distilled I'm going to put this in quote quotes.  That's in that spec. Comes out that one special tap DIY stands for deionized distilled water has a higher quality of deionized water. It's it's way too high way more expensive than we can apply then we can we can give the lab what Deanna ionized water is its water that's had all of the various ions taken out of it things like core. I bromide copper iron any kind of iron and they've been replaced. Usually with H+ ions are sodium ions have been actually been kind of swamped out of the whole thing distilled water has no liens in it whatsoever. They called the Stillwater sometimes 18 Mega. Ohm.  18 Micron water which means it does not if you've ever seen that commercial on TV for where they take the Brita they take the Brita water system against the zero water system in a put the little thing in it and it reads zero it reads almost zero transmittance are not transmitted enzyme conductance. That's because it has no liens in it. In essence what DIY water is it's really really clean really really pure water and it's great for experiments because any extraneous material that's in the water can screw your experiments up. Okay. So you're going to use DIY water to rinse these things and you're going to use DIY water as the water that you're going to feel these things up with make sure that you're using DIY water for this and in fact, the general rule of thumb is lab water is good for washing a good for washing your dishes.  For washing your glass where it's good for washing your hands, but the last water that should ever touch your glass. Where is the d i water?  Do you have water in fact actually dries without putting a film of cloud of anything on your glass with zits? It's good stuff doesn't taste worth anything, but that's because water tastes great because it's got minerals in it.  But really good water really fresh water has no minerals in it tastes really good its base. It's great for making coffee and soup and stuff like that. Alright. So before we get into the next  piece of information  let us stop this.  Oh One Last Thing Before. I Go On  For exam one you do not get a cheat sheet.  But after exam one.  Usually the lab. Are usually sorry usually the lecture.  right before  Boat the exam I'm going to pass out. Chi-Chi's to you'll get it for the second exam for the final the first exam. You don't get one for a lot of different reasons. All right, let's answer this question, which is sulfite.  Again, this is a question to be on the test. So I like this.  Okay last chance to answer.  Quick answer is B.  Remember sulfate is so4 -2 so sulfite.  82 ight means you lose one oxygen. So it has to be SO3 - 2  by the way, I think the 31 people who answered a are people who aren't in this room, so  I think they came and clicked and left so  This is also a way of keeping track of those people as well.  Unless you really think that sulfide is that which case you need to amp up your studying for the fight for the next exam. All right.  That's good.  One more time going clicking one more time if you want you and let's go over and talk about Solutions and dilutions. So in chemistry  we deal with a lot of materials that are mixtures and these mixtures are what we call Solutions are homogeneous mixtures typically insolvent like water or something like that. The reason we do this is because you're easier to work with it is easier to measure out of volume of something then it is to wait it out and especially for small amounts for small amounts of material. It's much easier to weigh out a large amount make a solution of it. And then from that get a smaller amount out of it. Okay to pickle chemical reactions are carried out in such a way that goes starting materials are ready and solution before the reaction is carried out. This ain't in contact for example to reduce two chemicals have to come together in contact with one another before they can react.  It also ensures an equal distribution of whatever you happen to be dealing with instead of like little pockets of chemical in it. Okay, so we have to describe what the composition of solutions is solution composition volumes have to be utilized to determine the amounts of materials present and a mouse are chosen to be reported in convenient a unit set as needed which means that concentration by definition. What a concentration is is it is how much of one material you have dissolved in another material or how much of one material is present in?  Another material the units of concentration can be almost anything. They can be volume for volume mass. Per mass mass per volume. We use what's most convenient to us and that's what we're going to see here. What are the most convenient wants to do? First of all, we have to understand what a solution is a solution is a composed of a solute and a solvent Solutions are homogeneous mixtures by definition. The solute is usually the material present in the lower amount.  It could be usually thought of as a material that will take part in a chemical reaction or in this case on Friday. It's the material were actually measuring the blue food coloring.  The solvent is the material into which the solute is dissolved and is usually present in a larger amount in general. We think of the solvent as being a carrier.  Ada sperzel agent now at this point in time. I'm going to make it sound like a solvent.  Is inert and I will tell you this you're going to find out when you get to organic chemistry solvents are far from inert.  But for the most part in general chemistry as we talked about solvents solvents, what they do is they act as a carrier for the solute Solutions can either be strong electrolytes weak electrolytes or non electrolyte.  It's going it's going to be easy to describe these in just a minute essentially the difference between whether something is an electrolyte or not depends on whether it can conduct electrical current weather can conduct electricity.  An electrolyte solution is a solution that conducts electrical current and the only way something can conduct an electrical current is if when you put it in the solvent of Interest, it undergoes ionization or dissociation and science which means not everything is going to be able to do this. So for example, if I take something like  hydrochloric acid now or acids  all acids are electrolytes.  Oh acids are electrolytes as far as you're going to be concerned.  And all acids are molecular compounds until you put them into water. So for example, if I take HCL.  And I put it into water HCL aqueous now, we'll talk about exactly what happens a little bit later. But what happens is HCl call their sets up an equilibrium between this where HCL dissociates to give H+ aqueous.  plus co- aqueous  the degree of dissociation  is a measure of how much?  Of that Compound on the left separates into irons on the right now ionic compounds like for example things like sodium chloride.  NaCl aqueous  I do this again giving an A + aqueous.  Plus co- aqueous both of these have an ionization.  That's equal to or that's greater than or equal to.  about 80% so they can they go anywhere from 100% from 80% up to 100% k  compounds that ionize to these very large Extenze or strong electrolytes.  Call pulsatile tinnitus high extents are strong electrolytes all of the strong acids, and we'll learn what the strong acids are a little bit later all the strong acids.  Many of the very soluble or salts are strong electrolytes. The only ones that you have to know for sure that are strong electrolytes are strong acids and strong bases. Okay.  Again will talk about what the strong acids and strong bases are later.  But then there's compounds like acidic acid hc2 H3 O2.  Aqueous this is acetic.  Acetic acid is an organic acid and it's a Scott one acidic hydrogen in it when you put it into water. It also undergoes ionization.  to give H+ aqueous  + C2  h302 -  aqueous the difference is the ionization.  Is less than or equal?  To about 10% in other words only about 10% and it's a weak acid only about 10% of it. I and izes because of the fact that I am sure formed. It's an electrolyte because of the fact that less.  At 10% or less ionized. It is a weak electrolyte and as a result of conducts electricity weekly.  No, do all ionic compounds strong electrolytes. And by the way all weak acids all weak acids.  Are weak electrolytes? All strong acids are strong electrolytes. Okay. Can we make are all strong bases are strong electrolytes are weak bases are strong are weak electrolytes. Can we make the same statement for ionic compounds in the answer that question is no.  Sodium chloride is a strong electrolyte dissolves in water calcium chloride dissolves in water, but it's not as strong of an electrolyte and the reason has to do with these with something that we won't talk about in here formation of complex ions or complex iron pairs. The only things you can say for sure is that an ionic compound when dissolved in water will be an electrolyte?  The weather will be a strong electrolyte or a weak electrolyte has to be determined by experiment.  nonelectrolyte  Are materials that dissolve in water but do not form ions. These are typically type 3 compounds that do this. So, for example, I'll give you a two examples that you know, right off. The bat. First one is C2 H5 o h Sears.  Ethel  alcohol  Ethyl alcohol in water.  stays as  C2 H5 o h k  it does not.  ionized okay glucose  Sugar is another example to glucose is not sugar but it's one of the compounds in sugar glucose.  which by the way is C6 h-12 o-6 stays as  glucose  It does not.  Ionized so what it means is these compounds are soluble in water. However, however  Even other soluble in water they do not form ions. And this is typical type 3 compounds type 3 compounds don't form ions in solution.  So typically what happens if you dissolve in water, but they do not conduct electricity because they do not form ions. So again, whether something is an electrolyte or nonelectrolyte depends on when it when it forms ions, which is which goes to say sort of the punchline of a lot of what I'm talking about here is comes down to this. Just because something dissolves in water does not mean it will be an electrolyte conduct electricity.  Hey.  And it depends on what your dissolving in the water.  So against idea of electrolyte and nonelectrolyte be is more important for other kinds of things. We'll talk about later in chemistry and in other topics, but it is one of those things that we want to clarify for you as early as we can. So if you remember that a solution we need to talk about compositions. If you rent if you don't remember that a solution is composed of a solute and a solvent and its Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. We are not going to discuss heterogeneous mixtures and any kind of great detail because they are complicated to talk about their composition at best.  The four main ways to express solution composition mass percent mole fraction. The most important of all of them is molarity.  And then finally one that doesn't get used as much is molality, but when it's used it's important to understand it. So let's start with mass percent no mass percent is the same idea.  As what you learned about when we talked about mass percent of elements in a compound except here. We're talkin about what is the mass percent of one material in a solution of that material. So the mass percent is simply the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution or if I ask you for mass percent of solvent. It would be the it would be the mass of the solvent divided by the mass of the solution both * 100, obviously.  So what you're looking at here is what percentage that's what the mass percent. Is that saying what percentage?  all of the mixture that you have  Is either the solvent or the solute?  So when you talk about alcohol for example Boos, that's a mass percent. What is the mass percent?  Of alcohol in whatever drink I happen to be have whatever bottle of liquor I happen to have.  Okay, another term proof is something that came out of.  history and I think I tore I think I have that in one of the things the whole reason was it when people with people would buy when  In the old days alcohol was like a coin you could you could barter with it and the way the captain's when they got alcohol, they would tell the person it was they were getting it from they say prove to me.  Do they sell alcohol? That's where the term proof came from and the way you would prove it. Would you would take a little bit and it set it on fire small enough in a little vessel and if it was below a certain percentage of alcohol, it wouldn't burn.  Below a certain proof. I think that was a hundred proof 50% So in essence what happen if that's where the term proof came from and kept it came from the idea that if you tried to cut your alcohol with water.  to make for example to eat somebody out of the Blues they were getting  do you get caught because it wouldn't burn proof came out of that proof is roughly depends on where you look but it's roughly the proof is two times the percentage.  Caso a hundred proof alcohol is 50% alcohol moonshine is about 85% about is about 85% or 80 85% 160 hundred 70 proof mass percent can also be thought of as the mass of the solute divided by mass of the solvent plus the mass of the solute * 100.  It is because it's a mass to mass ratio. There was no temperature dependence.  And so mass percent has no.  Mather has no temperature dependence.  Volume does have a temper volume as a temperature dependence Mass doesn't know mass percent is used primarily when we are talking about very concentrated Solutions.  Solutions that have very very high amounts of solute in them.  And the reason that we use mass percent to describe this is mostly because it is more convenient and it hides some of the problems.  set very high concentrated Solutions have  mole fraction  is something we don't use much gets used in something you could use in the gas laws, which you'll talk about in Kim 6p if it's used in the in the colligative properties that you talked about in 6p the properties of solutions that are functionally the particles you have.  The mole fraction is used when the number of particles is important. And the number of particles is easiest described using moles. So what is it? Well, simply we we represented as x lowercase x sub a where a is what we're talking about. So for example, the mole fraction of the solute is nothing more than the moles of solute divided by moles of solute plus moles of solvent.  Okay.  Sona since it looks kind of like the fractional abundance and it is for all intensive it's the mall fractional abundance.  Show the mole fraction of the solute is the moles of the solute divided by the total moles.  That's all you + solvent. Okay, you could also talk about the mole fraction of the solvent. This is a lot of times we want to talk about solvent. We talk about it in terms of mole fraction. What is the mole fraction of the solvent mole fraction of the solvent is moles of solvent divided by moles of by the total moles again, because moles we've already talked about those because moles are a mass measurement. There's no temperature dependence. The one thing that's always true is that the sum of all of the mole fractions has to add up to 1  So for example, we would simply say that the mole fraction of the solute.  Plus the mole fraction of the solvent.  Has two equal one, which means if we know what if we know one of the two the solvent or the solute we can determine the other one.  This by the way isn't handy relationship in the gas laws for various reasons sexual talk about their the most important of all of the ones that we talked about. Our molarity molarity is going to be temperature dependent, okay.  What molarity is it's the moles of your solute. So what you do is you measure out your solute in grams.  You use the molar mass to convert those grams to moles. And then you very analytically using a volumetric flask dissolve it up in a solvent like water.  That now gives you a concentration that we call molarity. It is abbreviated using the capital letter M.  M stands for moles per liter and I would recommend that until you are completely okay with that. In other words. You don't have to think about it more than a second that anytime you see molarity.  0.25 molar that you convert this immediately 0.25 moles.  Because if you forget what the units are, it's going to make this clear in a scrub calculations, especially on this lab which you can do a lot of that kind of stuff.  Molarity is moles per liter. It is a way of measuring out a given amount of moles very easily. Okay?  Don't notice that the denominator is liters of solution.  not solvent  So what it is, it's the solvent plus whatever volume.  the solute takes up  Don't forget very dilute things. This isn't usually an issue.  But again, you need to know that it's it's saw its it is not solvent. It's solution.  so if I had something that was  0.78 molar  Glucose I would know that I have 0.78 moles of glucose.  For every 1 liter of solution, whatever that solution happened to be water blood doesn't matter Saline.  Know what this also means, by the way is that if you take molarity and multiply it by a volume.  That'll tell you how many moles you have.  If you take the moles of something and / the molarity and tells you how many leaders sorry leaders of material you have or you need to take out remember? It's moles per liter moles per liter.  Later in the course. I will refine this for you to talk about what how many what what do we do with is there a trick we can do it with milliliters your ta is May tell you about I don't want to do this in class formerly because it'll just confuse people.  And you're not confused enough yet? Okay.  So what about concentrated vs. Dilute Solutions? Okay.  Think about you think about it in terms of like  Going into a bar and asking for a drink and you say I want a strong drink versus a week drink while the difference between the strong drink and a weak drink how much alcohol is in it, but it's relative.  Because what I might think is a strong drink somebody else might think is a is moderate or weak. Okay the strongest have by the way with something like like is 100% of whatever the alcohol is. Okay. Now that's not as quiet as clear when you start dissolving things like sodium chloride. What have you in some water? So what can we say? First of all, the one thing we're going to say, is it concentrated vs. Dilute?  Those are terms that are relative and depend on what you're talkin about k a concentrated solution.  Is a solution that has a high level of solute present.  I'm on the surface. That sounds  sort of like duh K. However.  a concentrated solution of sodium chloride  Is about 6 moles per liter.  a concentrated solution  my put this on the board, okay.  a concentrated solution  of NaCl in water  is about 6 molar.  a concentrated solution of silver chloride in water  is about  1 * 10 to the - 5th molar  both are concentrated but concentrated is a function of how much of the material will dissolve in the solvent and not everything is soluble in water.  So again concentrated and dilute depend on what you happen to be talkin about. Okay dilute Solutions are one that have a low level of solute present. And even though this solution of silver chloride is concentrated. It's as much as it can have it still dilute because it's not much there's mom not much in there. So how do we talk about a solution is concentrated and dilute?  There's this one. It's just flat-out concentrated. Okay to that we use the term saturated a saturated solution is one that contains the maximum amount of solute possible.  And this takes into account whether something is soluble or not. So in general what we typically say is this concentrated Solutions in general.  Are greater than about 1.5 to 2 molar dilute Solutions?  Tend to be less than 0.1 more less than or equal to.  0.1 molar, and actually I'll even put that leaving change this.  a little bit more will say that it's  actually less than or equal to about 0.5 molar most always in chemistry the solutions you're going to deal with when they're diluter going to be less than 10 smaller. Okay General numbers.  saturated solution depends on  the compound you're talking about.  Saturate a saturated solution is a solution that if you put one more molecule of the solute in it.  solid starts to form  Okay, how many of you are familiar with Monty Python?  How many of you have ever seen the the dinner of the after-dinner mints kit?  If you haven't you should look it up. It's where the guy eating so much and if the various is old got to have it after dinner menu don't know I'm so full. I'll explode if I have one to have one. Okay, and he eats it explode. That's a supersaturated solution. That's a saturated solution.  and by the way  So here's another one date to date me.  How many of you know where the term?  only don't do that comes from  Oh, man, you guys are pathetic every year. It's funny come from In Living Color every year the number of students. Who knows what that means goes down. You haven't seen In Living Color, especially the early years. It's okay. First of all, I didn't recommend it to you. Yeah minutes on podcast.  It was Keenen Ivory Wayans and Damon Wayans and his crazy family doing is it's pretty funny sort of dated a little bit. But Jim Carrey got to start there anyway.  Get a chance watch it.  Write 42 is 42 is the answer and that's another one very few. People know nowadays.  What words that come from?  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  game  You're not going to like it. Alright, the dilution dilution is something that we do only take a solution that is of one concentration.  And add more solvent to it to change into a different concentration. Okay.  BF English important to remember here is this  when you do a dilution  All you're doing is adding solvent. So the moles that you start with will equal the moles that you have at the end. So in a dilution  in a dilution  the malls  or the mass  Absol Ute initial  will equal  Hummel's  Or Mass.  of solute  final  Okay, that's important to understand a concentration so I can meet with this way. We talk about delusion. We can also talk about the term concentration concentrating a sample concentrating a sample is this is where you take you remove solvent from your solution.  When you concentrate a sample and remove solid from the solution the same holds true the moles that you start with.  Will always be equal to the moles at the end.  When you're only adding or removing solvent, that's all it's going on. So what we can say in talk about this and again here is a delusion we can use something is called the dilution equation.  Or it's called concentration or it's called the dilution equation could be used for concentration as well. We can say this.  that the initial concentration  X the initial volume  will be equal to the final concentration.  * the final volume  so putting this into putting it somewhere where I can write it better.  Concentration initial times the volume and nishal is equal to the concentration final X. The volume final we're concentration is equal to mass or moles.  per volume  So in terms of molarity what we can say, is that the initial molarity.  * the initial volume is equal to the final molarity.  * the final volume  definition of you've looked over the experiment know you're going to have to do this calculation a number of times.  And we can do this over and over again by taking samples out of our final solution.  And then diluting those again. This is what's called a Serial dilution.  This is what's called cereal.  Dilution see if I have that slide on here.  I I do I'm going to do that a little bit later here. So calculate the molarity of a solution.  If you're given the grams of something or the moles or something.  And it's volume you simply take that moles to grams converted to moles and divided by the volume and again here in the case that we did for this one. We took .71 5 moles of glycine and we put dissolved in 495ml. We convert 2 milliliters to liters and we take the moles and / that we get 1.44 molar glycine.  How do we prepare dilute solution from a concentrated solution again, we're going to use our same going to use what we said on the last live now noticed the first part of this and this is something you need to get used to seeing. Usually the first part of most questions not always tells you something about why.  We're interested in this calculation, but it doesn't tell you anything useful.  So you need to look at these things and decide whether what it says is useful or not. Okay. So how would I prepare point eight liters of isotonic saline now? That's why only useful thing that's in that top in that Top Line. Is this that isotonic?  So I may go backwards here. The only thing important in that whole thing. Is this that isotonic Saline?  Is 0.15 molar?  That's what comes out of that. So what we're going to do here is we are going to determine how much  We need to prepare .8 of isotonic saline from a 6 molar stock solution here is sort of the walkthrough on this thing, but I could have also done this by saying that.  the volume initial  and this is the stock solution.  Would be equal to the final volume. I need times the final concentration divided by the initial concentration. So in this case the volume final I need would be 0.8 liters.  The final concentration I need would be 0.15 moles per liter.  The concentration I'm starting with is 6.00.  Moles per liter and that would give me the same answer the volume of that that I need to make the rest of this to make the solution up.  How do we calculate the mass of solute in a given volume of Solution that's easy find the moles and convert it to grams.  Showing here how many grams of of solute are present in 1.75 L of 460 molar sodium hydrogen phosphate again, write the chemical formula for that to make sure you know what it is.  So there we go. We have 1.75 old leaders times.  The molarity is .460 moles for everyone if we multiply the leaders by the moles per liter, we get moles and then from there since we know the chemical formula we can take the moles of that that we have and converted to grams and we find that we have a 114 grams of dihydrogen. Sorry model hydrogen sodium phosphate.  Consortium  again, that's what I'll stop houseware II note by different names and you do some again easy find out how many moles you have converted to grams if you're given grams to start with converted to moles / the  Buy the volume to get the molarity.  now serial dilution  serial dilution is one calculation that you're going to have to do on the post lab questions. That is without a doubt anyone have to do this for the experiment. This is where  My students understand this stuff will shine when you get the biology biology does serial dilutions all the time and part of the reason for this is that physiologically active amounts of materials are generally very very small what you're going to find when you do the blue food coloring lab is it? There's very little blue food coloring present in the food but enough to give it a color.  And at that amount if it's needed to give it a color is very very small cuz the stuff is so highly colored. Okay, so a stock Solution by definition  Is a solution it's usually have known composition once in awhile. It's not but almost always it's as it is it is a solution you start from that's the definition of a stock solution. It is a solution from which more dilute Solutions are prepared.  It is what you start with.  To make your married it's what you got. Its what you want to measure but typically there's so much material in it, but you can't measure it directly. What you have to do is a dilution. Okay. So here for example, we put up this question a 500 mL of stock solution of 1.25. Mol of lead II nitrate is prepare, okay.  From this solution is taken at 2 mil aliquot. Now the term aliquot means sample.  k  the term aliquot means  sample  It is a term that we use almost exclusively when we're talking about taking something from a stock solution.  A2 metal aliquot is taken and a new solution is prepared by diluting the sample with water to a total volume of 300ml from this new solution is taken eight 5. So here we're going to start with I'm going to do it. I'm going to do some things here. The first thing is that I'm going to call this.  concentration one  Okay.  This is going to be volume 1.  I'm then going to call this.  volume two  Okay.  So I'm going to use.  C1  Sorry when you see one.  V1  vive1  and V2  to calculate C to K this new solution.  Okay, this new solution is going to be C2.  This is going.  to be  The three I got to be careful here because I'm going to shopping. My number is here and is subsequently diluted to a final volume of 500 milliliters. I would have called this before and so the concentration I'm going to need is what I'm going to call C4. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use  C2  V3 and V4  to calculate  c4k  show  since we don't have time to do that calculation, they would do that calculation on Thursday. But I think what I would like you to do is when you get a little time before Thursday.  Do that calculation now again, remember we have an exam on Tuesday. I will provide the scantrons.  Be here by 7:45. I will see you on Tuesday.  sandiego.edu "
