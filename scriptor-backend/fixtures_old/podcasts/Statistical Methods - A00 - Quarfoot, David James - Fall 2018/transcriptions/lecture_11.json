    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Welcome back.  Sad 30% everybody.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Who cares about accountability in life?  whatever  how your news questions 1 and 6 were the worst.  These were the questions are required actually knowing a bunch of things from your past.  question 1  we had a problem very similar to it on one of the home works. So you got to experience what it's like to remember all those summation formulas. You can see lots of people didn't really master that just by doing it on the homework once so these things happen.  73 median  a little low  not sure that there are numbers these things should or shouldn't be asked a hundred different professors or get a hundred different answers you taking an exam met with a median or the average was a 40 that happened yet.  Okay, here we go.  We had this little problem.  Last time we were talking about the concentration of iodine and some sample random sample comes to you you tested how iodine it is.  And we had this function help us figure out.  That's what if map out all the different iodine concentrations. We might get and How likely they were you might have asked yourself the following question this thing you came up with here. This function is density function. Is that a naturally occurring one that comes up all the time or is that just something I chose cuz it's easy to integrate 3x squared.  Okay. Well, why don't we have to go study the ones that come up all the time instead of trying to guess whether that was or wasn't so the uniform distribution is probably the easiest and most common thing you come across in life. So here's what you need is some finite Zona possibilities along the horizontal axis and you need all of those to be equally likely relative to each other.  Okay, so we've seen an example of this with our little spinner  Here it was the angle be measured and I forcibly made everything equally likely by just saying it that's one way to create these kinds of distributions may not feel very natural.  Okay, here's another one waiting for the bus right at 8 a.m.  Sometimes it feels like it could come at any moment in the next 10 minutes and you don't even have any real feeling about what's more likely than anything else cuz the bus schedules are just a big hot mess.  And there's a million things that affect that so there's another possibility where you might use it here. It's not so clear that equally likely and you still have sore to be told that.  Here's a nice situation where you don't need to be told things are equally likely you sort of know this from working with random number generators in various programs. So maybe C plus plus or whatever you're using can spit out random real numbers. Usually they just build it so I can do it from zero to one because smart people can then create any kind of range. They want out of that by doing various operations, and they don't want to endlessly quote code every possible thing. You could ever want in a random number generator cuz they have other things to do with their lives. So Random Number generation is a perfect example of a uniform distribution and the values are uniformly distributed spread out equally nicely through some zone. So here's the sort of General set up.  You have some Zone A to B.  And the density function will just be constant. That's one way to make everything equally likely behind here is uniform and back when we started talking about histograms way back in the first class. We talked about things like, you know, motoland bimodal and when there were no pics when I was flat we said uniform so this is the continuous version of that idea back. Then now this rectangle your house have area one intense. This side length is b minus a the high better be 1 / B - A to get the area to come out to be an appropriate density function and its hero everywhere else. Not very exciting. Can't get those other numbers.  Oh, that's too bad.  Now, let's see how your intuition is what value do we expect to get on average from the uniform distribution to find / AP someone be daring raise your hand and commit.  You're willing to commit what do you think?  b - 8 / 2  does anyone have a different opinion?  You have a different opinion to yourself. Well done messed up.  The reason for everything right? So why did you change the A + B / 2?  That's how you find the average of two things. There's a good reason to go that direction. I like that. Okay, so your conjecturing that we get a + b / 2  if you remember the midpoint formula from say Algebra 2. This is how you found midpoints, right? You do this to the x-coordinates you would do this to the y-coordinates. Okay. If you do a subtraction, it's possible to get things maybe outside the interval or things that don't make any sensor.  I don't know if I believe you yet cuz you had some skepticism within yourself, right? So let's go explore if I actually believe you all I have to do is go push this through the formula and see what happens.  So x x f of x well, the nice thing about this is that f of x is as gentle as you could make it. It's just one over so you might have say  Antioch still sitting there. It can't come outside the interval yet.  Now I have to integrate x that's doable right 1/2 x squared.  Okay, and then you just need to plug in BNA. How are we ever going to get a plus sign out of this big mess? You might be asking yourself don't integrals always create minus signs when you plug in the upper and lower bounds.  Well, hopefully some sort of exciting algebra will create what you desire so much in life.  When you plug in DNA you subtract them you get a difference of squares and luckily. I know how to factor that.  And in the process of factoring that you create this beautiful plus sign that you so desperately wanted to be true.  It's amazing how the mass will show you the truth.  You just push it through. I also love how your intuition was there after an adjustment. That's good. I can't tell you how many times my intuition has been wrong, and I don't really trust my intuition anymore on almost anything. I mean, I guess I do a lot of things that  Her super cut like at the edge the Forefront of knowledge and so intuition is always a dangerous thing at the Forefront.  Contractions of the word for like I've done this before and I sort of see what I should do.  But when you're at the Forefront you never done it before so you have to be very careful. I just bought some writing time with our philosophy.  If I want to know the other facts to now, do you have an intuition about with the variances?  He is x squared minus new Square. That's great intuition. It's true right least you're saying something true. Okay, you probably don't have intuition about this be - 8 squared / 12.  Where does 12 come from I want just pops out of the mathematics somewhere doesn't need to like be intuitive to you. They don't put your emotion on like what you need to see on to this. It just is what it is. Okay, you can go prove that if you want and you can take the square root and you get the standard deviation be - A / Route 12 even less intuitive.  So most of the really really strong students will go and verify these formulas and in the process will see that the 12 just sort of popped out from various operations that are happening. That's it.  Okay, so I have everything in that box absolutely memorized it burned into my soul and there's no way to ever get that out.  What are some Socrative and see how you do see if the internet will work today?  9 people in the room  see if you can get that to 190.  Random number generator spits out things between 1 and 4 which of the values of the random variable?  Assume it is equally likely that was gentle.  Directly told you to assume that random number generators.  Are equally likely what is the height of the density function when it is non-zero?  Mr. Eazi  Now what percent of the class will get this, right?  Haiti  if it were 80, I probably would have taken it out by now, right?  Oh my goodness. Only 50% of the class got that right. Well, what happened? What's everyone doing?  Not quite sure. Okay. We had the formula for the density function 1 / B - 8 said how high it was just putting things into that formula.  Everyone else is doing other things. If the thing were three High over a span of three big the area would be 9 which isn't one in most number systems.  Okay.  What is the probability of getting the number pi?  You ready to guess what percent get this, correct?  30% random guessing give 25%  You're feeling 30. Okay, so your soul is telling you something should we trust your souls. What's about to happen?  Art of intuition about things that you've never done before.  Okay, so 80% So these people that are putting be attempting people that are putting a or using the height of the density. That's not how you find probabilities. Just not the height of the density function is the area underneath it. Right? So the probability that any random variable variable equals a particular value is zero by whatever probably the number is at least three.  90%  are you using your own impression of things to make decisions?  Infinity  probability is always between 0 and 1.  I don't know why you would ever say infinity as a possible answer. Okay, all you can do is imagine this picture started 3 and start shading area. Eventually it ends at 4.  So we have three to four and that's a height of 1/3 going up. So 1/3 * 1  What number do we expect on average to come out?  If I just generated thousands and thousands of these numbers men average amount together what's going to happen?  You looking for some hints on how to finally start getting the percent correct? Watch how fast this has been counting up compared to other things?  Conference of the indication of like  how is your heart something is so what's your percentage uncorrect what you got?  What you think Brandon could be 30%  Yeah, 85%  Oh, that's why I okay.  So, how do you how do you decide how what percent are going to get the screen while you watch account up and watch the Speed and you analyze the problem and you say what's going on in this problem asking for the expected value of a random variable and when people need to do plug things into a formula people at this level very good stuff into a formula level 1 difficulty of plugging stuff into a formula. Some people don't know the formula used to it. Issues. You know, that's why this is only in the 80s. There's still things to worry about K some people of the formula memorize incorrectly. They're still doing b - A / 2 because you put it out there in the universe.  And look there see so one reason people do b - 8/2 is cuz you said it another cuz you said it cuz it's intuitive for some reason and B- a also appears one over that is the height of the density function. So it shows up that is B minus a and the standard deviation in the density function is B+ and okay. What is standard deviation in the numbers being output?  Spit out lots of numbers and look how much they very hot spot out. There are.  You did that so fast.  Is like 3 seconds?  Pure formulas right \u221a 12 screens that you see now you would like having emotional connections to things in the formula.  And if we have this meta conversation about how does one going to get a square root of 12 blah blah blah. I walk over there. It's very dramatic people remember this.  Okay. What is the probability the model outputs?  an integer  Are you ready to guess what percent get this, correct?  60 why did you say 60?  Picture something something in your soul. Tell me about your soul.  Okay.  There are only four integers between 1 and 4 inclusive.  I want one of those things to possibly happen. They each have probability zero.  Interesting, huh? So to group together and I spy my little collection of things are excited about still probability 0. What is the probability the model outputs and irrational number?  goodness  What's this?  Irrational is not imaginary. They both start with I have plenty of syllables.  Oh my goodness.  Let's go to your non-existent soul by your own declaration. What percent get this, correct?  50  this is hard to guess right?  So you probably read the little answer you need to know about how dense the irrationals are.  It turns out that almost every number in the interval is irrational.  whatever that means  so the area under the curve is one. So for those people who taken 1:40 or 1:42, you probably had a hope of answering this for everybody else. Who knows.  It is the complement of the rationals and irrational's are what's called countable. You can list them in order and there's a nice there's only like a tight amount of them. It's not out of control. So the rationals have zero probability.  You said rationals are discreet.  That's not what I said. That's what you said. You're asking. Also it now has a? At the end rationals are discreet. Okay, no decide what discreet means different definitions depending on context if the definition is given any two of them?  Theater next to each other it would be nothing in between then. The problem is there is no next to each other. Even for the rational numbers anytime you give me to I'll just average and get one in between. Okay. So whatever you think it's the one next to it that's not well-defined. So we would need some definition that didn't require next to for us to talk about discreteness of rationals. That was just for fun that you should not  Not get worked up. If that didn't go. Well that last one.  Cuz that will never go well, but it shows you like how complicated the questions can get right? I just asked a simple question to State and it's very very hard to get that right? Okay. Now let's move on to harder things.  Things can always be uniform in life equally likely so that's when the exponential distribution notices on the homework.  It's not the same as the exponential function that uses the exponential function and hence the name, but it is quite different. So here's a little setting someone gives you some sort of rate is a rate based on sometime. We'll go back to the Portland Timbers soccer example. Okay, so, you know, they score 2 1/2 goals per game.  Now what I've done before is I asked you questions about the numerator idea goals. What's the likelihood of getting a zero Go game where they score of 0 or 1 or so on but I could also ask you about the denominator idea the time how long does it take before a goal actually happens?  So when people are asking you about time until occurrence.  Of whatever event is going on in the numerator. This will be modeled by an exponential distribution.  And the reason this is a continuous random variables because time is actually continuous now often we round things to the nearest day or the nearest hour or the nearest minute or whatever, but at its core time is continuous unless you know in a physics.  Did you no longer believe that anymore but that's separate first time will be a nice continuous thing.  Is there a next moment after this moment?  I'll let you physics Majors think about that. So exponential distribution amount of time until the occurrence of something now, this will feel a little geometric.  What's different is geometric you're like doing a thing like flipping a coin in your counting the number of flips not the amount of time.  In case you're also you're given a rate that involves X.  So when you set this up, you're going to need in a parameter called Lambda and you didn't make sure you set it up. Right? It's always the units are going to be the events that you're excited about. Maybe goals in a soccer game. / whatever time unit is going on in the problem. It could be hours minutes and so on.  How often you have to be told that something is exponential in order to know it is not obvious at all. But if the question is ever asking about how long you have to wait until you see something then the only way you can never answer that question is with an exponential distribution. So that's also an hint you should probably use the exponential distribution. Even if you're not told  so here's the density function Lambda X. Guess what the exponential function makes its appearance e to the negative Lambda X. That is the only Define for X greater than or equal to 0. Okay X Series representing how long you have to wait to see that goal in the soccer game? So negative times don't make sense.  In the setting so that's why ex has to be negative. So is 0 over here to the left. When you draw this picture on your page. Be careful. There is no asymptote here in 0 it just goes to the height of 0, lamb. You can plug 0 into the f of x function and see it has a height of Lambda.  Also this function stop because it goes forever. So whenever we do anything with it and start finding areas under it those areas might extend out to Infinity.  It just makes all the calculations more difficult.  So first thing you might wonder if it's actually a density function.  Are you just like throwing some nonsense about the board? So first let's show with the valid. So it better be above the axis always or on the axis.  Which you can see from the picture and the area under it has to be one. So she was how you would go show that this area is one. We again have an improper integral.  On every exam about this stuff. If you don't make them proper, it's always - 1/2 I know exactly how many points we always take off for people that don't do this properly and I so choose your favorite letter put it in the upper bound and have the limit push that upper bound off to the end of the universe to effectively create this improper integral from 0 to Infinity. I don't care what letter you choose B shouldn't choose one that already exists in the problem. Otherwise, you're going to make a big mess.  Now we even did this problem didn't we last class?  We were previewing this idea.  We also did the spinner 2 preview the idea of uniform. So this probably won't feel so rough Lambda X. If you were to differentiate this the chain rule would spit out that extra negative Lambda.  And I would combine with a negative sign here to make a positive Lambda you see?  Another reason that you need to put these limits on here and make things proper is because often when you're doing this.  You create a very complicated expression. And if you just allow yourself to plug in Infinity, like it's a number you might get things like Infinity over infinity indeterminate quotients.  Okay, and when their limits on things, you know how to resolve indeterminate quotients using l'hopital's rule. So provides a notational structure that you can resolve things in life and you'll see this on the homework will be a moment. You're like, oh I need use l'hopital's rule to resolve this weird thing. I've created. Okay. Anyhow, let's plug in the upper bound plug in the lower bound. I'm starting to see the number one showing up. Hopefully everything else will get destroyed and turn into 0.  Sow the seed of the negativland to end.  Well, guess what? I am just talking about a time-based rate. So it must be a positive idea. You can't score negative goals-per-game in a soccer game. So if Linda is positive if n is going to infinity and if there's a negative sign that exponent will be negative Infinity.  And he did a negative Infinity is just 0 so we did it. We got one.  To feel good.  So if you look at the density here, basically what it's trying to tell you is when you have something that's an exponential distribution in wants to end earlier much more than it wants to drag on forever.  Okay, it's very hard to have to wait hours and hours and hours to see a goal in a soccer game. It's much more likely to occur early on.  That's all this is basically saying when you look at the picture that says you think about it. So let's try a little dishwasher example. I just got a new one last year.  What are cool things about the exponential distribution is it does do a good job of modeling a lot of things when you text when you care about them failing like electronic components of a very few people have in this room have a cell phone. That's more than 8 years old or 10 years old. Most of you don't have a computer. That's more than 4 years old things break Electronics break whatever and they tend to break earlier rather than lasting forever. So dishwasher break down once every five years can't touch anything. The system is so fragile up here.  Oh my goodness. What a hot mess. I know how what is the probability the dishwasher lasts at least eight years with no break down.  The first thing you want to do is figure out Lambda. This is actually hard work sometimes and pay you need to make sure you put the idea that sort of discreet that you're excited about this event e  Venti latte that is event at asked in the numerator and the time-based idea in the denominator. Okay. Now usually you'll stop writing all these units but make sure you're always putting the time in the denominator.  Next thing actually set up a model for me. So make a random variable use the word let you can use the little curly symbol here is distributed as  then after you do that say what does this actually mean the amount of time in years until a breakdown of a random dishwasher. You could think about a little box hit a button to tell the number between 0 and infinity. That's how long your dishwasher last now lesson write your question using probability and the variable you just created you always do these steps. It doesn't go away and the higher-level you get in statistics. You just rely on this notational support so much more.  You need notation to help you with things get more complicated as notation the super powerful and compresses so much and give you so much power to do things with.  Anyhow now it's time for you to finish the problem. I help you set it up.  Let's see if you can do it in four steps.  So I hear the things I saw.  About a third of people got that - 1/2.  Because they didn't change and make a proper and put a limit in front about a third of people decided to do any easier problem.  8 to Infinity improper improper integral nonsense. It's exhausting have a 1-0 to 8.  You okay?  Okay, you can also do that. So it probably X is greater than equal 8 is 1 - probability lesson 8 and then you get the bound 08 which a much nicer can only do that if you want.  I saw some people do the antiderivative incorrectly.  That hurts you have to be really careful about this kind of stuff take a second and actually differentiate. Will you think it is when I differentiate this I noticed an extra 150 is going to pop out which is exactly what I want right here.  So sometimes taking that moment is super helpful. So that is not a mess. Later.  Okay e to the negative 8/5 I came up with the decimal here. So you have some idea of what kind of number were talking about 20.2% chance that your dishwasher will last eight or more years.  Call someone that I asked her son. How is this related to Busan? Will you notice on that earlier slide? I said if I give you a rate you can either go one way with it or another way. Would you care about the event happening which are discrete ideas high goals in a soccer game for son is right way to go about time until the occurrence of an event that's continuous and you'll go with exponential. So this to me feels a mixture of poisson and geometric does both elements in there.  Talk and text all these things are all tied together the relationships among all the distributions and this is something you study like in a mathematical statistics class at a higher level. How long do we expect on average a dishwasher to go before that first break down and how much variation is there in that amount?  Is anyone going to be daring and tell me what you think you expect on average? Go ahead 5 years, why'd you say 5 years?  The problem tells you one breakdown every 5 years.  Okay, so what you need here these formulas the expected value of the variance and standard deviation.  I've always memorized they're burned in my soul. I use them every day. Okay. Now this first one they expected value.  You can guess your way into.  And if you actually just plug in what's going on in this problem, we get the answer five years. If you build a model based on this average behavior of what's supposed to happen. And then you say what happens on average guess what it says that thing right back to you.  Okay, I don't I don't need to go do an integral to prove this to you. Although we could if you want it.  But I'm glad your intuition is there now what's what's intuitive is how much variation and how much standard deviation is going on. Now the way I remember these formulas is the expected value is intuitive.  And I say how do I get the right answer? Lambda was actually 1/5?  Okay, and the time idea was down in the denominator. So if the question is about what happens on average for waiting time, you need to get that idea back up to the numerator which is why this reciprocals here to do that. Very operation. That's how I remember. It's one over Lambda vs. Lambda the poisson you set it up with Lambda. Also. It's an average rate of the events and then someone says how many events will happen on average. Well, that's about the numerator idea soon. I have to do anything fancy the expected value just Lambda fortress on so you can use the unit idea to help you remember the formula now so I can help you. Remember all this variance and standard deviation. That's just memorizing things. Okay. So you're the standard deviation is also 5 years.  So on average at the 5-year Mark, there's going to be a lot of breakdowns going on but things down a standard deviation and up a standard deviation will be very common. So 0 to 10 years is a very common dishwasher experience. Although I don't know how many people in this room have everybody dishwasher. I was 38 years old when I bought my first dishwasher.  Okay. Now there's one cool property about this exponential distribution, but no other distribution has no other continuous distribution has  It's called memory. Listening is just like the most suffixed word you've ever seen.  Well, I don't antidisestablishmentarianism you probably heard this nonsense is another like over the prefix and suffix word. Well, here's your new example of like overly suffix things. So what is this property say? Well, it seems a little example. I think this is good because it fits Society a little  you have some politician in your mind. I'll let you choose tells 11 Lies per week.  There's some rate is a finger measuring it's discreet of the lies and is a time-based idea, which is continuous at X to be this.  Okay, so clearly by me / 7 I've decided that the denominator units should be days rather than weeks until you could have done 11/1 and then everything's about weeks, but I just switched I wanted you to see that you can do that. So here's what the memoryless property says.  This is pretty intimidating. The first time you see it. Okay has a conditional probability in it lots of variables going on. But if you break it down.  The one of the right is saying okay, Texas, how long until you lie?  And it's saying what's the probability that a person can last three days before that first lie?  How long can they make it was supposed to get in this tea over here what this is saying is supposed to know they've made it s days already.  So whatever that first lie happens, it's a greater than or equal to s.  You're probably wondering what the probability they make it tea additional days beyond the S. They've already made it.  So something's memory list. It should have no memory of what's happened in the past.  And one way of saying that is whatever has happened in the past doesn't change How likely I am to think about various probabilities. So if you made it ask days, I don't care you made it a stays. Okay. I'm just thinking about you making it t additional days.  I have no memory of those first s days.  So some people just memorize this definition some will serve Paisa meaning into it. But whatever has happened already that is be given in the conditional probability doesn't help you make a decision about lasting 2 days.  I know some things are very obviously memoryless and other things it's kind of complicated. Okay, so like do electronics have a memory.  Like when my dish dishwasher got up today just didn't know that it's made it an entire year without any breakdowns.  It may or may not even just a complicated but a lot of things you figure out that exponential well models them and then because of that they just come with memory listless and you're like, okay. Well, I guess guess my phone doesn't know it's worked all these days now anything like in real life that actually a parts that we're down will not have the memory loss property.  planned obsolescence  In terms of our human body in our ability to like do something but other things like kind of do have this memory loss property Electronics some Electronics hapis. Okay, and eventually you learn slightly better ways to model Electronics Bayville distribution, but that's when you get there.  Try little thing here. So I think of politicians are good example because some politicians I know just seem to sort of wake up and just just random whatever comes out of the person's mouth and it's like it doesn't matter what happened before every day is a new adventure right and like you can't predict anything based on what happened before. So if you believe that politicians are an example of this, I'll let you choose whatever one's you don't like right now, then we can do this memoryless property. So if you wrote a statement like this, which follows from the memoryless property of the exponential it basically says, okay the probability the human being or thinking of to make an entire day without a lie.  Will not be affected by the knowledge that somehow three days have already passed. It's like those 3 days mean nothing to this human being  Okay, it's a very strange the first time you see this property there certainly things that seem to have no memory random number generators don't care what's happened in the past, right? They just do whatever they want to do. Now. They don't have the memory loss as property but they have this emotional idea of no memory. So the memory of this property is a very specific statement about probabilities. Now if you want to go see why this is true about the exponential distribution the handout will prove it or you can try to prove it on your own by just calculating these probabilities in various settings. And one of the cool properties is if something is memory listless,  Then it must be an exponential distribution. So it's like an if and only if kind of statement in math, if your exponential you get memoryless and vice versa.  Which is not easy to prove that all that takes a lot of work.  So let's go back to the dishwasher. It hasn't broken down in 30 years.  What is the probability you get at least eight more years?  Oh my goodness.  So first, let's set up with the problem on.  If x is the breakdown time of my dishwasher, we know that it's lasted at least 30.  It is a fact that is given so goes to the right side of the conditional and our goal is to get it to last eight more years. So that means the breakdown time would have to happen after 38 years.  This problem feels very overwhelming to attempt. But when you remember that exponential's a memory list us, this is just the probability that X is greater than or equal to 8.  Just need to think the last 8 years who cares what's happened in the past? I have no memory of any of that cuz I'm a dishwasher.  And you know this equals each of the negative 8/5 because you did it. So this is one way to use my realistic to help you. You can take some really complicated situation in which you have all this information about up to the moment we care about but it turns out to be totally irrelevant and you just needed the last 8 years.  So it's largely a simplification tool.  So that's the second big continuous random variable and it takes on values always between zero Infinity.  Unbounded and its support as they say now it's time for the most common one that always comes up you probably even heard of this before in life.  Even if you haven't taken a stack class the normal distribution.  Also called the gaussian distribution also called the bell curve other. Lots of things have kind of curvy Bell shapes and look like Bells.  So here's the density function f of x is 1 over the square root of 2 pi *  this Sigma x e to the negative 1/2 * x - Mew / Sigma quantity squared  Oh my goodness.  You can see what I said was a little different than what's written up there when you do the transformations.  No, I remember the moment. I saw this is incredibly overwhelming, right?  You've never seen an object. So complicated before and actually had to do things with it. Well and time you memorize this and it becomes comfortable in this class. We don't need the density formula function very often we tend to do a bunch of things without it and you'll see why later but when you start doing more complicated statistics you use this formula all the time. In fact, there's a multivariable version. Also be more complicated associative matrices be multiplied in it, and it's okay. You don't have to do it all at once.  So there's the formula you can see some pictures it gets its name because it looks like us Bell sort of her curves or whatever. And what school is there's all sorts of different ones these parameters Sigma and you aren't just random letters. I chose they actually stand for things. So you will be the mean expected value to what's cool about this distribution is when you create it you select Mew and sigma and in effect, you are dust the siding with the expected value in the standard deviation will be  Those other ones it's not that easy, right? Okay, so you can see me here setting up Mew is 3 that's going to be the high point on the graph and also the expected value and the standard deviation is one so it goes out maybe a couple standard deviations each way and that's where most of the things are.  And then the blue one is just shaped much differently. It's all impressed because the standard deviation is very small. So it's tight around its meaning.  No, one reason this is so important is because it just shows up with almost everything in life.  So, for example, I took one minute and said can I come up with some examples of things that are normal in real life? And here are the first four I came up with? Okay, and then I went and looked up with the actual a means and standard deviations work and I didn't have those memorize human Heights in the u.s. Welding Model Nails you get these numbers for what's average and how spread out it is the length of a fish. Okay, and I wouldn't found that fish breed. I've never seen one of my life. That's what diastolic blood pressure is the bottom number when you get your 120 over 80  Is actually 120 / 77 on average.  But that spread on this IQ scores this in example where they forcibly made the meme to be the number one hundred and they forcibly decided to spread out in this to be 15 IQ points on the IQ scale.  How could you use this? Well, let's do a little problem. Let's say you're very excited about dating and you care about the heights of the people you date. And this is one of your it Rhea you only date people with certain height things, okay.  Height of a US woman normally distributed here. The mean is 65 in standard deviation 3.5. Let's just go ask a million people and collect their data on that's where you get that from. Okay. The only way to know is normally distributed right now. Is that someone tells you  A lot of the physical things about the human body turn out to be normally distributed more on that later. What is it? Probably the next random woman you see how to hide over 6 feet. Maybe this is like your cutoff not date anyone below 6 feet.  I don't have the rules right every rule has a probability associated with it that becomes a factor that you multiply against the population size.  Can't have too many small multipliers.  Otherwise you're in trouble.  So, how do you do that? Swell first set up a variable? There's my random variable X has the normal distribution always Capital end and then we'll put the mean and then we'll put the standard deviation that will be the convention in this class. So what we want here is the probability that X is greater than 72, okay.  I know how to do this. All I have to do is set up an integral, right?  And a tentacles going to find us this area right here.  There's the unibrow we get to do.  All I did was I put the density function downright and field in the Mew and sigma.  That one thing you should know about this integral.  You can't actually do this not because you're not good enough, but because it's mathematically impossible to do this in a roll using any techniques.  So what we're going to need is a way to find this area somehow.  And that's what we focus on next class.  Have a good one.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
