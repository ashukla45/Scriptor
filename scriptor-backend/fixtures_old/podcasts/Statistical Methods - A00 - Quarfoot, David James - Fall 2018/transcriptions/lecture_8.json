    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast on a reminder. When is Wednesday?  I should be I should be honest. I think the exam is quite difficult. I don't say that to scare. You just be honest about that acts. So there's some sort of sense of  What might happen K you should really study seriously for this is no joke. Okay next.  when the forward new material  We were looking at all these common questions to come up in The Human Experience. So you can do some Bernoulli process again. That's something that can have one of two possible outcomes success or failure 10 has Tales everyone on CODIS and there's some success probability P. So sometimes you want to do it over and over and over until you get your first success. So the first is something we care about him, right? So that's why it's one of the, the other thing we looked at was doing it a fixed number of times so here and was given by someone your boss you whoever decides it and you're going to do these and Bernoulli trials and NyQuil.  Probably they succeed once or twice or Thrice sir. All in time. There was 0 times so that was the second, question we had.  Now we Branch out into some new ones and he's getting more difficult and model Richard kinds of behaviors. So sometimes in life what you know is an average Behavior or something.  How many goals you'll score a week how many times to go to the gym a year and so on and what you want to do is extract out from the average specific possibilities that you could be excited about.  Okay, so here's some examples some rate for something some average Behavior to be some idea you care about maybe it's emails and then will be some time frame. It could be in minutes. It could be maybe not time but like a game in a soccer match, which is actually a variable amount of time. But anyway forest fires in the u.s. Per year by mentioning location, but these are all weights and the denominator will be time based.  And specific behaviors, you can see you might care about getting no emails. That would be one of the best days of my life. It's been a few years since that happened.  Okay. Now this average that you're giving this number we're going to call the Lambda. This is the Greek letter Lambda. It's what people typically used when they're building what we're about to do.  And you'll notice here that I've chosen different time settings. So you could see that they're in the denominator and they can be different.  So usually when you have an average Behavior.  You can model or extract at the different possibilities for what could occur using something called. The poisson distribution is named after a French mathematician.  And it's hard to know when something is a poisson distribution in this class if you're given some average Behavior.  You will basically get to assume that.  A person can model what's going on, but it's a little more complicated and when you get to like a 180 a or 181a is when you learn the messy details behind what really makes something for Saint or not, but for will keep it a little simpler. So what Plus on discovered is if you know this rate parameter, which things happened on average you can with pretty good accuracy predict the probability of getting a certain number of things a certain number of goals in a soccer game, for example  And the formula here is limited to the x or X is an integer. It's how many things are going on. In fact a non-negative integer.  And then we have again each of the negative Lambda. Nothing special there. That doesn't use exit all that's always just going to show up and then in the bottom is X factorial. So it really helps that X is an integer cuz I'm guessing you don't know what to do.  how to take the factorial of say 3.7  Oh, that would be a mess right now in like a 18018 going to do something called the gamma function just the continuation of the factorial Beyond integers and intake like game of 1/2. You get the square root of pie. You can take game of -3/3 -3/17 game of zero. So anyhow, so let's see if you can use your little formula to try some problems average number of goals in a soccer game 2.5. That's a statistic you can look up online. And that's total. When you combine the two sides together. What is producing a scoreless game no points. And what's the probability of seeing at least two goals at some random game you attend. So we'll see if you can do these quickly.  Well, that didn't go so well.  Given what I saw let me show you some reason to didn't go. Well. A lot of people did not Define a random variable is one of the first things you want to do on every problem let x equal.  Okay, so I'm setting up this thing called X and it's being modeled by a poisson random variable or Lambda is 2.5. What is that mean? What is X doing? Random variables are supposed to hide value.  Is it supposed to spit out values that you if you want think about it that way so ask her would be the number of game scored number of goals scored in some random game so it could take on the value of zero or one or two and so on all the way up to Infinity it gets less and less likely, of course.  Okay, so you should think about a random variable as a machine that has a button on it and you hit the button and it will spit out one of its possible values.  And How likely it is to fit at that value depends on its probability table, but that's all hidden inside the machine the Black Box. Okay, and if you hit buttons, it'll be like tomorrow is game. You're going to see a 15-point game. Congratulations, Most exciting soccer game ever played it hit it again zero point game Sorry it again another 0% What x is representing the number of occurrences.  Of whatever. The average behavior is. No one way of thinking about it. If you go back here, there's always an idea in the numerator be at emails be a goals of that rate and that's what x is measure.  I tell you how many of those will happen when you go see one of the time events or the space events that it's describing a soccer game a u a year in the u.s. 0 in.  We want the probability that x equals 0 sometimes people will suppress writing x equals zero here and we'll just write 0 that's fine. If you have to find a nice variable and I know what you're probably taking the probability of a type this in 0 factorial is 1 people often to find it to be one.  That's something you have to know in order to work with us on raising things to the power of 0 is also one so you just get you to the negative 2.5. Okay, you could leave it is e to the negative 2 .5 if you want put a box around that or you can rounded to three decimal places on the exam. You can either have exact or to three decimal places. I don't care.  Now you might wonder like is this actually modeling reality? If you go check on this link here it will tell you of the 9000 plus games that have been played in the Premier League that about 8.1% of them are scoreless. So does an excellent job of modeling what actually happens in soccer. If you want at least two goals. It really helps when you have a random variable in your problem called ax cousin, you can write things like I need to be greater than or equal to 2.  And then you can say all I'll do the complementary probability. That seems a lot easier. I don't want to add up the probability for two and three and four forever. Okay, that's an infant summation.  Now we already found probability of x equals zero above you can find probably x equals one by just plugging one into the formula.  So there are parts of this formula that keep changing depending on what exes you can see the exponent on Lambda and the denominator in their other part to say the same you did a negative Lambda just sits there and every single one of these  That's fine. Just let it sit there and do his job.  Okay, so Persona super useful when you have averages and you would like to extrapolate back out to the non averaged ideas. The zero point game the 1-point game and so on so we can make a probability table here.  You'll notice it goes on forever. You can have a 37-point soccer game highly unlikely.  But it's theoretically possible I suppose.  Okay, so you can go through and just generate these Rose by plugging in values into the poisson formula really rare events. Like you're I plugged in 10 and you can see that the denominator 10 factorial is huge and it start to crush the numerator, even though the numerator has exponential stuff in it. Okay. So here we go. Not a very good chance of seeing 10 goals in a soccer game. This is  If you're trying to decide what sports you want to watch in life, maybe one thing you care about is how much action there is and maybe for you action equals goals, maybe don't care about all the other stupid nonsense and you only want goals in life Sports have different rates at which things are scored and you can go figure out the probability of seeing various things. Most soccer games. Look at these 20% 2521  Basically, if you go to a soccer game there are three or fewer exciting events, basically always if that's enough for you great. Go enjoy soccer. If you need more this ain't the game and you can just go find find the probabilities and if it does it for you.  Now you can still go check for 10 goals. That would be a very exciting soccer game. I don't know if you've ever seen one be on the high school level you get lots of tengo games when people don't know how to play but if you look like the Premier League there been 510 girl games. That's when you combine the two teams together and Catch of the Day to get .005 1051, which is pretty close somewhere else by this like tiny tiny amount. So put song is pretty impressive and what it can do and general the shape of a poisson will sort of go up and then back down.  Just drift off skewed right endlessly going to the right dragging things out.  So you already know now the probability of a particular outcome. That's what the probability formula does what you also need to learn.  Are the expected value and the standard deviation? We did this for the other models also, right. So these are hard to prove. I'm going to give you the formulas and if you're excited you can wait till 180.  Is where you'll do them at UCSD. That's my guess. So the expected value of x is Lambda.  You like. All right.  If you're going to build this entire super complicated model with this button in this hidden stuff inside, it's all based on one number the average rate at which Step happens. And then you like I'm going to hit the button and see what happens on average. You're probably going to get Lando right back out, which is exactly why you wrote that on your page earlier, right? It's just intuitive. Okay now it's not so intuitive by the standard deviation is root Lambda. This is just something that pops out of the mathmatic when you do it.  I'm in the units on these are whatever the units are in the problem. So if it were about soccer games, you would expect this. This would be about goals and the standard deviation is also goals that you get to observe when you go watch a game.  So there's our little fact sheet. So if you want to know what happens in soccer, okay. Basically you're going to see about two-and-a-half goals.  You can never see that actual Valley, but that's okay. And if you go up and down the standard deviation, it tells you what you really experienced most of the time as you go year after year. You going to get between 2.92 and 4 and if I think about all the soccer games I've ever watched that's pretty accurate where that guy who likes Italian soccer.  Is that your experience watching lots of games?  Yeah, there you go.  You've watched enough where you get to experience what really happens not weird events, right? Have you seen any Tango Games?  Ain't no game. You can go figure out how likely that is. You probably need to watch a thousand games before you see one.  Yeah, we have to go calculate the probability.  Oh my goodness soccer. So beautiful.  I can't watch it of course cuz it's so boring for me. I need more goal events, cuz I that's just how my Angela works or whatever. Yeah.  What there is variance the variance? You can find by just wearing this when you get Lambda.  So this is a random variable with the expectation actually equals the variance.  Who taught that could be done it can with the poisson in fact, it always happens with poisson.  So you would think maybe there should be a distribution out there with that property and here it is.  Yeah, so definitely has a variance. I just give you the standard deviation.  Now here's the one you don't do any easier classes like math 11. We don't do this one. For example, it's just a  little bit more complicated  So you seen the geometric now we're going to do this Bernoulli process flip a coin over and over and over until we finally get something we want maybe heads. Okay. So what you're looking for is the first success.  And what the probability does it say? Well, what's the probably takes 15 trials to do that or in Trials, whatever.  Okay. So a generalization of that is called the negative binomial and what you going to do is do something over and over and over and as you do it you'll be accumulating more and more successes and what you're hoping for is to get a total success has.  You want to build up to that? Okay, so from one 2K, that's the generalization that just happened.  Now you might notice the name here negative binomial.  What on Earth is that about?  so the reason binomial  fits the name here.  Is because it has some of the ideas of binomial so in binomial, you know, how many times you're going to do it and you're wondering about a certain number of successes.  In negative binomial, you know, how many successes are hoping for and the other thing was the unknown how long will it take? So it's sort of a versus negative.  What's known and what's a noun is one way to think about this?  Okay. Now that's how it's a little binomial nuts where the name comes from but it also has heard of geometric. Okay, if your goal in life is to get 43403 free throws and you're going to sit after practice and use going to start shooting over and over and over.  Then it's sort of like for geometric things but together you going to do until you get a success, but you're not going to stop cuz you're going to keep going until you get your second one and keep going until your 3rd and keep going until your four glues together a bunch of geometric prophecies.  So it's both of these things would have combined.  Okay, so let's look at a little contrast here just so you really feel the difference between negative binomial and binomial.  20% chance a random UCSD student majors in engineering that sound true  He said no.  biggest high  16 oh biology is the number one major economic system. Number two in Mass status number three, so it's really hard to be 60% when there's three things above you in life.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay. Anyhow, so he would be a binomial question you would ask in relation to this. Okay, you are definitely going to talk to seven people. That's absolutely fixed.  What's the probability three of those seven are Engineers? So here the fixed ideas the total number that are getting spoken to in the variable thing is like how many came up as engineers and you're super excited about 3 for some reason?  Okay. So this is how you would set this up you make a random variable which binomial it has seven is the fixed value and there's a 20% than any individual person will be like, yeah, I'm in I'm an engineer major.  Okay. Now, where's the number 3 between shows up right here. You're trying to get the variable X vehicle the three?  And that has some expression that we found earlier from the binomial distribution. So that's what it looks like when you're asking a question like this. You would love to meet three Engineers that your goal in life. So you're just going to start talking to people out on campus right? Go to them be like, hey, are you an engineer? I'll say yes or no. Okay and just keep talking to people and talking to people until you finally get 3 in the question is How likely is that to happen on the 7th person you talk to to hear the three is fixed in the seven was the variable thing that we just got excited about.  So the notation here would be set up some random variable or call it why you can use Nick binome if you want.  And hear the parameters it needs I'm looking for three successes. Any particular person I talk to is a 20% chance.  Now there's lots of things that could happen. It may take a million people to meet you three engineers.  but I would be super excited if it just happened to be 7 years in both places in both problems, but  Sheer, it's like the three is the variable idea down here. It's fixed. And in this one the seven is the fixed and in the bottom of the seventh is the variable. I just happened to be equal to the variable the very idea that machine just happened to spit out 7, so we'd really like to know how to find the probability here.  Are you ready?  You're ready.  Okay, let's do it negative binomial probability formula.  So we're going to do some bernuy thing. Let's say has probability P of being successful that's finding an engineer.  We want to get the case 6s.  and that could happen in all sorts of places the chance that happens on the nth trial is the following + -1 choose K - 1  Heinz Pizza, bouquet * 1 - P to the end - K now this seems formidable when you first see it.  Once you understand where it comes from, it makes perfect sense actually, so we'll have a low diagram here to help you see this.  So what do you want three successes? And you're wondering could I do it?  And and perfectly on the 5th person. So let me show you all the ways that could happen.  I'm case. You got to talk to five people. So there's got to be 5 letters in a row and you need to get the third person exactly on the fifth one. So, you know, it has to end in an S. However, it's done.  Great that you're ending on the 5th furthermore in the previous spots. We need to have two successes written somewhere. I don't care where you can see me a listing and all the possible locations here.  Okay. So any of these things would meet the requirement of getting 3 s's in exactly 5 trials and the last trial happens to be your last success. Those are all the ways to do it.  So all we need to do is add up the probability that any of these occur. Okay. So if you look at any of them, they're all going to have the three successes and the rest will be failure. So that's what this profession right here is doing is getting you the K successes you want.  And all the remaining spots there in - K of them cuz there's an total all the remaining ones have to be failures so that the probability of any one of these lines.  And all you need to do then is count up how many lines there are now obviously you can visually count hear the question is what do you do when it's not the numbers 3 and 5 and they're all sitting in front of you listed. Well, it's a notice What's Happening Here?  If you look to the left of this red line.  What we have are in -1 spots.  Because the one is to the right and what I need to do in those spots is choose which spots are going to get the remaining successes. The final success is in the last spot. So I pay -1 to put into these spots are so this n -1 choose K - 1 is just saying, how are all the different ways I could possibly position your remaining successes besides the last one into the remaining spots.  So I will never forget this formula once I see this derivation. It just screams at you. I make sense when you look at me.  Where's other things in life? Don't scream at me in the same way.  Okay, so let's make us a table now probability model. So here's our model first thing. You'll notice the smallest value. The smallest row number is K. If you want to shoot pay free throws, you have to shoot at least K shots, right?  You can't get three heads in two flips and another way of saying this now this goes forever infinitely many Rose. I could take you forever. It may never happen.  What's a 0 probability event?  Choose any zero probability event and try to get successes out of it. You'll be going forever. Okay. So here we will row. This is when you're trying to end it in exactly an intern.  We had that our successes or failures and count all the different ways to arrange the other successes in the spot before the final spot. Now all the other plugging in these valleys like a + 2 + 4N is all I'm doing here. Okay. Now sometimes he's simplify cleaner things.  Find a matter like they can be complicated baby can clean you can see the first one like this one makes a lot of sense. You only got K spots and you got to succeed every time that's just a lot of success has strung together. That's all. Okay, so it's cool that the formula collapses to what you know, it has to be in the special case.  I trust the formula more now. I hope you do.  Here's a pretty picture of what's going on.  So what did I do hear negative binomial point to that's a likelihood that thing will result in a success when you do it. If I shoot a free throw. Maybe it's a 20% event. That might be generous. Okay, and you want to go for three of them that would take me a lot of shots. You can see this goes on for a very long time. This is big gaping hole here. You can't ended in 01 or two.  You still haven't taken enough shots yet to get your desired number of successes. And he's also 10 like the poisson to sort of go up then come back down.  The exact nature of the shape depends on everything going on. What K is what key is etcetera, but that's vaguely the shape of you get most of the time for negative binomial.  Haters are fact sheet. You already know the probability formula. So let me give you expected value. What's it going to take on average to get those k6s has you desire so much?  k / p apparently  this makes sense if something has a very low probability of happening like a 1in 100 and you want 17 of them this is 17 / .01 which gives a huge result 30 goes to zero if your event is rarer and rarer this expression for the expected value goes to Infinity going to take you forever to do it basically  What's not obvious here is the formula for standard deviation route k p over Q.  KQ / P with a route on top. No one way. I remember this. I don't know if this will make it better or worse for you is if you want to do a negative binomial you just doing till you get a success in doing till you get a success and doing till you get a success and it's certain number of successes. So it feels like K different geometric process. He's all in a row, right?  If you remember the expected value for a geometric process, it's one of her pee. So you need to one of her pee to get to your first success on average one of her pee to get your next UK over p.  And you can also use the standard deviation and variance formulas for the geometric to prove this formula here for the negative binomial. That's how I remember. It actually have the eye of the variance formula memorized. That's what I do, but you guys use the standard deviations more  Another frustrating thing you're going to learn about these is most of these distributions have another way of expressing them. So the redistribution  Maybe maybe you don't care about like how many total trials it takes. Maybe you only care about counting up all the failures along the way.  Well, there's a very and redistribution that's related to negative binomial for that. So it gets a little confusing in my head because I have the distributions and all the redistribution basically memorize and hard to remember what class uses which one it gets a little tiring. Anyhow, let's just try little problem here.  Tell Joanne besides, you know what I'm going to serve a tennis ball in over and over and over 20% of the time. I'll make it in. Okay?  After practice who's going to hit shots over and over until she can get $10 in you've heard stories about pro athletes doing this right after practice. They shoot free throws until they get a certain number or they'll take a certain number of slap shots until they can get them in and however many takes it takes so Joanne wants 10 total average how many shots will it take to achieve this goal on a given day and how much variation  So this is just really pushing through the formulas. You have to realize that the Bernoulli thing is does the tennis shot go in or not, and that has a success probability of .22 at swipey took that role and joins going to sit there until they're 10 successes and then it ends immediately. So 50 shots give you a good sense of should you sit here and do this every day?  Based on how much pain you want to take.  Now you can decide on like this expected value be like I want to do a hundred shots roughly on average in the back Drive how many successes?  Or you can do it. The other way. The standard deviation here is 14.1 for you can see the sort of lived reality of Joanne as she does this across various days of nice days. There is low as 36  Toby some days that are a little rough rough at 64 that'll be most of the experience. But of course, I mean it's doable in 10 shots.  MD very very far from the average right, but it could happen.  So the standard deviation will give you most of the stuff that's going to happen in life.  So there's negative binomial.  Let's see how you do Billy is going to flip an unfair coin. There is the heads probability 40% at the Paley coin.  Until he gets five heads.  What is the probability the final headcount occurs?  On foot six foot seven on average how many folks will take Billy to get?  the five heads  Let's see if you can take the situation.  Cram it into some modeling.  Hopefully somewhere in your page. It says let x equal and you've defined a random variable that she wants to be messing with.  Ask yourself what can vary in this problem.  When you're setting up the random variable.  You should let X be something that could actually very like how many times does it take?  In order to get your five successes that could take five or to take a billion, right?  So X should be a negative binomial random variable.  It's like a little machine and you hit a button on it and says today Billy is going to have to flip the coin 72 times.  Okay. So this is how we set things up negative binomial case 5S. The number of successes are desperately hoping for and he is a probability. It comes up heads on any particular one of them. Once you have the letter X the problem. It's a lot easier cuz you can write things like this question wants T of x equals 6 or x equals 7.  And those are actually disjoint events. It can't take both six and seven times for this to end on the same go through so you can just add them together using the key of A or B rule easy one and then each of these sea sticks is taking on the role of end in the drama.  And then 7 takes on the role of end cuz and it's expressing the value of the capital x could take on some big hot mess and you get .08 6.  Was that acai 1 in 11 chance, roughly?  1 and 12 chance that it will take six or seven, but that's cuz there's lots of other possibilities, right? It could take fewer than six or more than 7 on average how many so this just asking for the expected value? So you just read k / p and you do not round this value.  It's going to take about 12 and a half Clips. It will never take 12 and a half cuz it can only be an integer value but on average that's what you expect.  Some days at 11 some days at 13 some days at 5 some days. It's 16 it all just sort of averages out.  Save now seeing the Big Four.  These are the most important probability models dealing with discrete ideas notice. If you look at the values X could take on in the things we've done. They've been things like 0 1 2 3. Sometimes they would end at n i can by no meal. Sometimes they would go forever to infinity or can geometric or negative binomial, but they're all discreet.  there spaces between those values  now when you're thinking about the models at a high-level, you should know its name. You should know what parameters are needed to set it up for example, geometric. All I have to do is tell it how likely the Bernoulli thing is to occur.  And it knows that you just want to get one success.  Okay, so the geometric is nothing more than the negative binomial when K is one. It's a simple case in addition to knowing the parameters in needs. You should know what's called the support. This is the collection of values the random variable could actually take on when you hit the button on the random variable machine and it spits out something issue. What could it spit out? Well, if you're going to do something over and over till you get a success and you want to know how many times it takes?  You can only get values like 1 2 3 4 5 and so on.  In addition, you should know what exit trying to represent in the various things. So in the geometric, the number of Trials needed that's with varying from one go of this to another and it's number tiles needed to get your first success.  It's this infrastructure. That's so critical. This is what you want to focus on don't just jump to the formulas. That's the worst thing you can do is just throw things at formulas setting up a problem beautifully that shows real understanding what's going on.  Okay, so then we did by no meal and there's just has more parameters. Now. You need two things. How many times are you going to do the Bernoulli process?  And How likely is any one of those times to lead to success?  When you doing that the thing that can vary is how many successes you get out of the end possibility of possible values so you can see this as a a support that goes from 0 to end this is he belongs to symbol if you haven't taken 109 yet. It says here the possible values expert Akon it will be one of those values and only one of those values is it called finite support?  Okay, it doesn't go on forever. So the nice clean little package here. And in this case access the number of successful trial data be fixed in Trials are going to do.  Hey, and we did for song.  Here we started with some average Behavior. That's how the rate or frequency parameter Lambda. The units are some idea in the numerator that excite you like goals in the denominator with sometime this thing like / 90 minutes or per week or per soccer game.  What ex is spitting out when you hit a button on the little machine and play a soccer game is how many numerator ideas occur a zero goal game a one-goal game and so on.  So again discreet you can't have a 1.7 goal game.  70 super interesting  you have this team of experts and every time there's a shot on goal. You can order fractional amount of a goal.  Like they really should have scored there. But the goalie was miraculous will give him half a point.  And whatever the time event is for the denominator.  That what's important about this land as you're setting it up, you know that the idea you care about needs to be in the numerator and the denominator needs to be the time-based idea. So if I say every two weeks I eat 14 burritos at Chipotle.  You need to make sure you put the right number in the numerator and denominator the time idea 2 weeks should go down there and the 14 burritos, which is what you care about to go up in the numerator. So even if it's worded in a certain way don't get confused time in the denominator and then we did negative binomial. Are you going to go and go and go until you have K successes total? And then you stopped when you finally get your case.  Chase  weird word, okay  So the thing that can vary is how many trials it takes. So here the support the smallest number of things could be okay, and that goes on forever to Infinity so named parameters support and what the random variables actually trying to tell you.  Then on top of that that's the important stuff. That's the hard stuff for people to learn on top of that. Then you do the easy stuff. What's the probability formula? What's the expected value? What's the standard deviation?  So if you for round this understanding and background formulas are actually better in life.  Okay, so let's start building some skills here first kill. Someone gives you a random problem. You got to decide which of the four models.  Oh, I've been situating the problems within the the choice right? It's too easy.  Then once you decided what model there's only four things that you know how to do.  You can talk to me about one row that's like the probability x equals 3.  You can tell me about multiple rows probability that X is greater than or equal to 2 that will have an inequality sign in it. I can ask on average what value we expect the table to give us or the machine think about hitting a button or you could ask about how spread out those are.  So here's an example of a problem that isn't buried in one of those four mediately and see if the figure out what to do. UCSD Women's Water Polo team is real data, 385 goals and their 39 Game season file. That's a lot of games.  Is anyone on the team in here?  It never happens.  I guess maybe I should choose a different sport. What sport do you think people in this room Varsity Sports? You think they're on  Look around.  They look like soccer people.  Is anyone on the varsity soccer team?  Is anyone on a Varsity Sport?  He is.  badminton  Okay, I'm not doing it. What's the problem with a score two goals in a game?  So you got to decide which models and when you want to use here, so what kind of things were you giving?  What's it asking about? Oh my goodness. Well in this problem.  Maybe you can see I've given you an amount of stuff goals that seems to be the exciting idea going on and he was a time-based idea games. So it looks like I've given you a rate. Actually it's not expressed in that way immediately.  But it looks like they're getting about 9.87 goals-per-game when you divide those numbers out. So you could set up a poisson model that is not a fixed number of times that something's happening. I'm not asking you about how long until you get something to happen. So it doesn't feel geometric or binomial to me letter X you say what what on Earth is X actually measure with poisson. So take the numerator idea of Lambda that's goals for telling you how many goals will show up in a random denominator idea a random game and it's exactly what it wants. We want to get two goals. Do you want to set x equal to DOS?  Then after that the formula appears and then it's easy, but the setup is hard. So we're going to practice has a bunch.  Now what would rather questions look like? So here at the table? You don't want to write all this down, but you can just look at it.  Okay. Well, I just asked you about this road right random variable could do lots of things that's probably gives to okay, if you wanted fewer than three goals that language would translate into adding up those first couple of rows there.  If you start using language, like what's going to happen on average when I go to a UCSD Women's Water Polo game?  Well, you're going to see about 9.87 goals, cuz the expected value of a poisson. It's just the rate that you plugged into it when you were building it.  And finally if you want to know how variable it is from one game to the next.  There's some measure of spread would help you answer that.  Okay, so sometimes people love sports not because of what happens on average, but they care about that. There's huge spread to get a very wild experience from one games of the next what's a sport that has a wild variation in it?  golf  some people might say it's always boring.  Expected value is boring with zero standard deviation golf right Tiger Woods, just like first in one and then 57 in the next competition. That's good. I don't know. Anyhow, don't be some Socratic questions and I wanted to show you I put tons of extra practice problems on here for you. It's all about LGBT percentages and feel free to go work them and get more screen choosing the model which is a hard thing, but we got to stop.  UC San Diego podcast. EDU "
