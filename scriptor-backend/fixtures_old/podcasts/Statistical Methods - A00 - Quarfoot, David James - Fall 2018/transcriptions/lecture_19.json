    "Full Transcript": "I'll come back. Happy Friday.  I bet you're all looking for the 3-day weekend as a my I will not see you on Monday. I will not be here at school. There will be no office hours Etc. We will all take a little time to relax including me. It's hard giving a TED Talk 3 times a day * 3 days a week * 10 weeks.  Okay.  Here we go.  We're in the home stretch now 5 6 and 7 chapters 5 6 7 you have all the foundation and in truth. You also have almost all of the tools. We just need to put things together in certain ways. So the first thing we're going to do is  go up to 30,000 feet.  Can you make you realize what's coming? So we're going to think about means in chapter 5 proportions in chapter 6.  And will always start with the easier cases and each of these will just try to study one population that has one parameter that were excited about and will do inference that is will build confidence intervals will run hypothesis test. Then we move to the heart of things of two populations.  And then we'll repeat for proportions.  That's it.  Now the only thing you need to know in order to do all of this has to do with the sampling distribution. You start buying sample. So you're excited about what does it actually look like? Well, you actually know the answer already when it comes to me we discovered that the sampling distribution loves to be centered at the True Value, but there's some Sprite Avenue and it depends what's going on up in the population and it depends on how big your sample is. That's a pain she might feel like we already done the top branch. In fact exam had plenty of questions about means one population confidence intervals and hypothesis test.  The trouble is I wasn't really telling you the truth back then and the situation is actually a little more complicated than what we were doing.  Uh, oh.  So what really happens in life?  Whenever you draw a small samples, which is a lot of the time for people.  Or if you're studying a population where you don't know Sigma?  That's basically everyone always.  It turned out that there's something that better approximates the sampling distribution than a normal curve and it's called a t-distribution. So here's a picture of the t-distribution. It's here in blue and you can see what a normal curve looks like at the dash. Of thing here in red.  They look quite similar. Don't they?  Do we really need to get some super complicated thing just to be a little more precise in life.  Well, you do care about this. If you're deciding whether you're drug should be put out into the market and whether it actually does anything or kills people so you noticed it all the time and all this problems.  I never actually told you Sigma really right and we would always just use the standard deviation we got.  and the sample  and that would be a pretty good approximation for Sigma what the problem is. We're trying to approximate Mew. So you're usually doing for me right and if in the middle of that approximation you make another approximation that is replaced Sigma with a standard deviation.  You made the problem a little dirtier. And so the T distribution is something that reflects the fact that in the middle of an approximation you made another approximation just to make the first approximation.  Intermittently quite complicated when you study this it took me years to finally pieces altogether. Okay. So the T distribution, it looks a lot like the normal you noticed an important difference is it has thicker tails the blue curve is higher way off to the left and right the thickness is the height. So anytime you do anything that's around P values which involve shading to the T distribution will give you bigger numbers cuz the tales are taller so it tends to make you be more conservative.  Cuz big p values keep you with what you believe in life where small BP values you throw ideas out and move to new ideas.  So the question now that you've seen two things and one was the old truth and one is now going to become the new truth is when should I use what and the easy way to answer? This is you should just always use the T distribution from now on now that you know about it in life. You will basically always use the T distribution. There are some incredibly rare cases where you get to use the normal distribution.  But these are mostly theoretical exercises that these appear in the real world. You never actually know Sigma to always make that approximation in the middle of your work approximating, Mew.  I have never actually use the normal distribution on any real apply problem in my entire life and packed almost can't even do it in our  You have to do it all yourself, but in are there something that natural ways to do and deal with t distributions? So we're not going to use the normal curve anymore. The teachers person will give us more precise results. It's a simple way of saying this now the trouble of the T distribution in the reason we didn't intercept earlier is it itself is not just one curved but a family of Curves.  What?  Why can't you be easy and simple? So here's some pictures of different T distributions. And if there's different members of this family have something to index them by or keep track of them and that's called EF which stands for degrees of freedom.  It's best right now to just think about it as some indexing variable like a subscript on a sequence. Maybe don't you keep track of what term you're on now, you'll notice that as the degree of Freedom gets bigger and bigger the teachers tribution tend to look more and more like a normal curve.  Okay. So this is the normal is like the beautiful perfect approximation at the end of the universe of what the T distribution is going on.  So let's try some little problems here and see how they go.  How much area is to the right of -2.6 on this weird curved T sub for?  How to do this you first just dropped picture of the t-distribution you're going to draw something that looks just like a normal distribution.  You're putting negative .6 down and you'll shades of the right cuz it told you.  Now in order to figure out the area we're going to need the computer or going to need some fancy tables.  Okay, the same schools before right just when we go to the computer will go to a different function instead of P Norm you go to PT.  30th how you do stuff around the t-distribution. So here I said negative point six you'll notice suddenly now you have to tell it which particular distribution you're on your side to do the same thing for the normal, but when you're doing the normal distribution you were saying where you sent her to help spread out. Are you?  The t-distribution is actually always centered at 0.  But more on that later, okay, and here I want to say to the right you get some answer. You can also do it the other way to get some number is everything sort of works the same as the whole point of this problem. You don't need to reinvent any Machinery to do this.  PT is equivalent to P Norm. You'll also have the other members of the quartet d p q r  let's try another one. That's a good the other way what percent of the T6 distribution is more than 2 units from 0.  Taylor straw T6. It's a different member of this family known as I just drew something that looks like a normal curve Adele lookin distinguish will be indistinguishable. Basically. The only difference is Tiny things in their tails.  Okay to use more than 2 units from 0 to Pi zero. I went either way cuz it doesn't say which way you care about and now we just need to find.  There was two areas there. So one way to justify the air in the left and double it and I'll tell you what percentage of this curve.  Lies more than two units away. So you get some answer 9.2%  Now if you're super aware of what's going on in life.  He'll say.  What happens on a normal curve? How much area is roughly Beyond Two?  Standard deviations are units or whatever on the standard normal.  10%  5% 95 is within so 5:00 is without. Okay, so that would be 5% So I told you these things have thicker tails and you can see it right there is more area in the Tails of the t-distribution than there is in the normal.  Okay. Now she just missions are always centered at 0 not possible to re-center this somewhere. And in fact, when you try to re-center it, it gets incredibly complicated to something called a non central T distribution. And when you start digging to the documentation in our about this t-distribution, you'll see some sort of non centrality parameter that you should just ignore.  So if we ever wanted is a t-distribution the point is we're going to have to take the situation and convert it. So it's near zero.  Until Solace are standardized. So we have the standard normal if your goal is to get to a normal curve. These are the equivalent of the standard normal idea.  So let's try this with tables.  Now here's where it gets messy. What you going to do in a table?  You have a different table for every possible member of the t-distribution family. There is infinitely many. That's more than the number of atoms in the universe.  So we clearly can't make tables. So what you do is you noticed that the T tables are crummier.  then the normal distribution tables  So here's how they're set up.  First of all, this is the picture in the book. Okay. If you care about one tail and a problem, those are some pictures of a one tailed things look like they're about to Tails. That's a picture and it's probably just double the one tail, right?  So how did these actually go down? So you'll notice the degree of free parameters here on the left side. So first you say what which curve am I on? Let's figure that out. And then these numbers inside the table or actually places on the horizontal axis.  What was inside the table for the normal distribution?  areas  If you look up here at the top you see ideas that look like areas .05 that she feels like an area, right?  Staples exactly backwards on where it put puts things  So obviously something's been lost some like degree of precision. So this table can only help you do things.  And find areas approximately. So for example, let's go back to that last problem. We're trying to find the area Beyond Two.  Auntie 6. So the number to should appear right there.  It'd be really nice if there were two there and we can go up to the top and read off area ideas, but we don't have that. So you just go up and you read off we cared about both Tails. So whatever the area is between these two values.  So you not going to get an exact P value out of a t table?  it's okay if you're going to be using the  Table on the exams. It will say either given exact P value for your calculator people or it'll say give me downs on the p-value and usually just care if your P values like less than .05 you didn't care was .03 versus .04, right? So the tables designed appear to have the natural cut offs that people tend to care about in life. 105.012 said well, what are the X values that make that happen and then you can fit yours into that big Paradigm and get an approximate answer. So it's a little frustrating but the other option is to print Infinity pages in The carry that around which you probably don't want to do.  So what imprecisely be able to find areas?  And we noticed last time we got this area .09 to that's the exact thing from the computer Well turns out that's between .05 and 21.  It all worked out in life, didn't it?  Okay, so now it's time.  the return to means  but this time we're going to do things right precisely.  So the confidence interval used to you be your best guess X bar plus or minus. This was a z Star right now. It's t star sub and -1.  And over here is the standard error term which looks the same except now when we use the standard deviation in that piece, I feel good about using it because we've been in infrastructure designed to handle the fact that we're not actually using Sigma.  Now, what is this tea * + -1 this again is the critical value. If you get yourself to a t-distribution and you want to BC percent confident you draw me a little picture we put seed in the middle.  And you go figure out this place on the horizontal axis. The awkward thing here.  You might think if we have in data points.  We should look up everything on Tisha band.  It turns out you actually should look it up on to sub and minus one that is counterintuitive for most people and the reason for that is super complicated.  It comes down to one line and a 7-page proof that most people never read that has to do with this infrastructure.  Hey, that's why now. If you want to order some more intuitive sense, it's this.  If you're trying to approximate from you, it has some value we just don't know it so you go ask a bunch of people and of them.  Now the first + -1 they can basically be whatever weight they want or whatever Hyatt right. The last person can't really be what they want because the universe has a check on the system. It demands did roughly on average. They're all going to average together to be this number in the sky.  So the last person although they seem like they can be whatever they want have to control the situation.  So you see you start up at the end - 1 degrees of freedom and then one person sad late for us to bring things into balance of intuitive feeling that have to do with some orthogonal projection Matrix and some 7-page proof where you lose the dimension, go ahead.  No, I can't post that proof.  I can point you to a place if you want to go read it. You need a lot of Machinery. If you really want to read it. You need to take linear algebra, 20 20c and done some mathematical statistics. That's really not valuable this point it also there's something for you like like all my goodness. I see now. It's so clear and other booster. Like I just pushed horrible symbols around for pages. And now I know it's true like when you go to prove the sum of normal distributions is a normal distribution or when you go to prove the central limit theorem, either just horrible calculations involving moment generating functions and limits and Taylor series and like the authors of the book Loft anti-climactic. These proofs are there is why I don't do it, but you can ask me if you really really want to see something. Okay. Anyhow, that's why I 10-1. Hopefully that big metal discussion.  You can remember things. So anyhow, now the standard are used to be Sigma over root on but now we're saying let's be honest here. We're never going to know Sigma we're going to approximated with esta back when you do that whoops that was sort of dirty.  But that's okay cuz now the T distribution recognizes the dirtiness.  If you wonder how this all came to be. It's actually quite interesting.  So there was a researcher at Guinness the brewing company that makes beer and his name was Gossett and were talking 1901 and gossip was doing a bunch of averages but he only had small little samples would like four or five beers and was measuring something about them. And he noticed that something was always just a little off whenever he would do all this stuff.  I need some way of knowing that and he said why is it that everything is always just a little off and he got frustrated and he realized it in the middle of the steps this stigma that he didn't really know. He was approximating with sfx, and he said maybe that's not actually perfectly. Okay, I mean is basically okay, but maybe that's the source of the trouble and he discovered that if you use the T distribution in conjunction  with that thing that he was a little worried about this right here that then everything came out perfect.  Then he went to go publish the results and Guinness said we have a rule. No one's allowed to publish anything because you might give away our precious beer information with your statistical theoretical framework all the T distribution. So he said you must use a pseudonym and he chose the name student cuz it just seemed like some random pseudonym. So this is often called students T to T distribution, but most of these days are transition to gossett's t-distribution to actually give credit to the person who actually came up with it. Not his tuna name.  Okay, let's try one. Now. We're going to go and go steal. Some babies seems like a good idea.  How much does the average baby born in America was a girl weigh?  Kate is already problems with this.  What you going to do? Let the parents choose the gender use the sex to choose the gender of whatever. I don't know this already problematic, so  Let's just try though. You sneak into hospitals and click the weights on 12 random newborn babies.  Can I see from your data in your 12 sample, you get an average of 7.3 lbs I suppose.  And a standard deviation of 2 find a 90% CI from you.  The population parameter the thing in the cloud that will never actually know.  So first thing sorry what model is the best model?  To do all these calculations on that will give you the most precise results possible.  And their descendants problem. I didn't even attempt to give you any idea about Sigma. I've given up on that and I gave up on it a long time ago some of you noticed.  Heather's didn't others notice but didn't care others notice and came in and said wait are we allowed to do that and all of you got shuttled through the same shoe horn of let's use normal for now then I'll switch you over to tea.  So we're going to go to a t distribution. The question is which one?  Kiesub 11 is the particular curve that helps make these calculations as precise as possible. Yeah, we talked to 12 babies 1st 11 to pick their weights and the 12 said I have to bring the universe and Harmony so that your average isn't stupid crazy.  Now here's a picture of T sub 11.  And what I want to do if I want to be 90% confident as I want to think about standing at the center of that and grabbing most of its area.  So I need 9 with in my arms .9 that is witch please .05 on each end. Lots of ways to figure this out technology might be the way you prefer the most.  So here we need to speak UT command cuz we care about quantiles places on the axis.  You can see me setting it up on t11 and I plowed all the way through area. I didn't care about got to air care about to end of the spot I cared about.  So here's the best value 40 * 711 but you're going to need.  If you's a table.  Hopefully this 90% confidence interval thing actually is accessible by the table.  If 90% in the middle 10% of shared by the two tails sudo here to two tails and you go over 2.10 that was close.  If I don't like an 88% confidence interval, that would have left .12 in the two tails and point one to eight up here.  So I guess this means on exams. I've got to choose confidence levels that are actually look up a bubble in the tables.  That's something to know. Okay. So there we are over to the right column and then work your way down to the appropriate row given the fact, you know should be t11 1.80. That's basically 1.7 95885.  So you can see immediately like people that use tables and people use technology or going to get slightly different answers cuz already your star values are different.  Okay. Now that's it. That's the hard work. Everything else is pure formulas. Okay to break out the formula. Here it is.  Our best guess of what's going on. We'll start at our value we got that's this 7.3 and I'll reach my arms at a certain number. That's what he Stars measuring about 1.8.  Standard deviations or hear one something called a sampling distribution. So it's called the standard error.  And here I feel good about using the standard deviation over the \u221a end because the teacher has to be used in is designed to counteract that dirtiness.  Now here's what's frustrating you're going to see ends in the problem or Dare 12 and you're going to see and minus ones.  So it's going to get a little confusing the standard error formula still recognizes that there are 12 people going on.  The curve that you used to deal with things only cares about the 11's of things going on.  And then finally will put this in plain English for all the non quants people in the world.  I wonder what percent of the world would identify as non-quantitative.  What do you think that is?  Give me a guess.  He said do you think you're a quantity to person in life?  What percent of people say yes to that?  1/5  I don't know. What do you think?  I think they're good at math or Quant.  Let me ask you this. If you going to ask people, are you a better than average driver?  What percent perceive themselves to be better than average? Whatever averages?  Where to know the answer to this 1% say they're better than average drivers.  75% is the percentage of Americans that will say yes to that. So if people are very good at their self-awareness, they should say 50% or 50% will say yes to that right? Cuz that's what average means roughly so people are pretty diluted. So it may actually be a 50% Okay. We are 90% confident that the thing you're trying to measure in the cloud. The population parameter Mew is actually in our particular interval.  what that means is  our interval is one from an incident family of intervals that could have occurred.  Most of those intervals are designed in such a way 90% of them to capture, Mew, but I don't know about ours. Hopefully it's a good one will never know.  Goodness. Now you want to know what the true value is. Do you think ours actually captures it?  Does anyone know the average weight of girl babies in the US?  Where doctors decide the gender?  7.5  If you go look at the millions and millions of data points, where should I keep this datamon every single baby that's born believe it or not. So you can actually know the population parameter. If you go average billions of data points together. So ours was one of the lucky ones that's just  it's just chance that we got a good one.  Okay, let's try some Socrative. Let's see how you do.  Please enter Network today.  You're doing inference. That's just a fancy word for confidence intervals or hypothesis. Testing.  Means that's what you're measuring 1 population. Nothing is too complicated yet the sampling distribution.  4X bar the thing that talks about how xbar varies is.  Did you say it's not a trick question?  progress  there's two thirds of the room.  Okay, all you people that try to be stop trying to be fancy, you're always just can use the T distribution from now on done. You don't need anything complicated.  10 years from now if your statistics Professor there might be a few rare cases where you actually use the normal distribution one is when you teach it to people who are just learning It For the First Time The Others When you're doing weird conceptual proof Theory  Okay, great. Everyone's on board with t distribution now.  Decide to build an 80% CI for some mean what is the critical value if your sample has 15 people in it?  c table on screen 80% CI 15 people in Sample  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, that's pretty good.  All those 1.4. She probably saw in the exclamation what you did wrong, you forgot to subtract one and get yourself to the right T distribution.  You notice how minimal the differences though?  I really 1.34 vs. 1.35. You see what we're learning about now things in the hundred spot. So kind of nitpicky stuff for dealing with what commands in our will find you the critical value for the previous problem.  Select all that could be used.  Not just the most obvious one.  phone number  Are old school why use a separate device when the phone does it?  all batteries  why can't phones just have internet batteries? Why are we so inconvenienced?  Okay.  All the point eight people aren't realizing if you want to get to this place. You got to plow through area you don't care about and area you care about to find the location you care about 49 should be the right thing that you can also plow through just a tiny bit of area to a negative place and then make a positive because of symmetry. That's what answer C is doing now. I don't think anyone would ever do this calculation, but it's possible draw pictures to understand this. I was a worthless  Without actually calculating it.  What does this expression equal?  Let's funny. Did you get blown away?  You did.  Those are places on the horizontal axis to which you want to find some area.  What's there and tear what we do?  Oh.  T distribution turns into standard normal as the degree of Freedom gets huge. We saw that in a pretty picture earlier 1000 is huge enough.  You didn't maybe know that yet, but I chose something really big to help you would believe so I'm basically asking you how much area is between -1 and 1 on a standard normal 68 95 99.7 rule.  That's how people are getting be.  How much area is to the left of negative to Auntie 15?  Use the table on the screen.  Only 30 people have responded.  Hey, that's pretty good.  So I have to do is realize to the left of -2 is the same as to the right of positive to take T15 here and go find to to the right when my cursor is then go up and say all I care about is one tail right now. So my answer is between these two numbers 1025 and 4.05 which is answer see one more.  We want to do inference about means using a t distribution.  When did the T distribution actually model the sampling distribution?  extract  I think I'll get any A's and people choose a  people love a  just because we have a more precise tool doesn't mean you can create garbage samples will try to find the average weight of people in this room first person in my sample. What is your weight?  17176 person in my sample  third person fourth person you see if you just ask the same person all the time. The average is your weight 170. The sampling distribution is always 170. It doesn't matter how many times I come to you and ask you.  Okay, so you still need to have the conditions that we had before the people that make up the sample better be independent the easiest way to check that randomization 10%  in addition the thing that you're trying to study better not be nightmarish.  But it's okay if it's nightmarish as long as you start asking lots and lots of people from it. So the only thing that's happened is down here in the sampling distribution will be more honest about what curve shows we still need the transition from up here in the population down to the sampling to be honest and faithful and good.  Which is what do you say? I really wanted people to choose a thank you. It's so tempting.  Definitely want to keep those data.  People getting close to needing to remove questions now can't have that. Okay, if we're going to deal with this new T thing when we do confidence intervals, we also have to deal with it. When we do me I've started when I bought this testing. So here's a little hypothesis testing problem. Everything we do is going to look the same as it's always been except a bunch of T distributions will be everywhere. That's all you sure that the average finishing time of the Boston Marathon in 2000. Was this number 3.683 hours.  You can actually talk to every single person who finishes the Boston Marathon and average them together and get that number. So the population parameter.  You're curious of Runners are getting faster or slower in the current year.  First thing can you argue and give me a reason why people are now slower and a different reason why they're now faster. Can you argue both sides?  So that I can make a two-sided alternative hypothesis and it seems reasonable so argue one of the sides that you'd like to argue.  So you're saying people that ran it last year. I was going to run at this year than training longer blah blah blah. Well the people who ran in 2000 ran in 1999 and 1998 people that are going to run in 2018 in 2017 2016. I don't see what different there's a brilliant idea.  Shoes are better.  Hence time will be faster.  Okay, or how about training and technology and everything's not just shoes. It's hydration. Its energy. It's gel packs of carbohydrates.  Now someone are you the other way?  Why are people slower?  Okay.  Do you know what a parent is we heard the word heading to someone who obsesses over my new show in life. More people have walked on the Boston roads in the last 18 years hence wearing them down and it's causing slowness blah blah blah of the current Runners versus the 2000 roads were beautiful and clean.  Don't give me a different reason.  Louder, please.  Global warming. Okay, let me follow through your two word explanation. The planet is now hotter. If you've ever run you realize it sucks in the Heat and people slow down losing water energy dissipation of the body faster global warming. That's what you thinking, right? Okay, so I have a reasonable arguments on both sides so I could make a two-sided alternative and it would seem quite reasonable global warming is the answer to everything, right?  Here's another slower logic than you might believe more if you've actually run a bunch of things in your life to make more money the committee lets in more people than they used to.  As you start letting in more people you have only one way to go on Talent down cuz the best people are already doing it, right?  Your Uncle Joe gets to run the Boston Marathon now and you know, he's not any good.  Okay, go faster logic shoes for logic Road degradation combined with global warming.  Actually, if you've been to Boston you realize Road degradation is a real thing. It's disastrous there. So let's let me be the average time of finishers in the current year. Now, you could actually talk to every single person. It's possible the date is on the internet, but let's say you're too tired for that and you're going to actually do some sampling. And so that the problem can move forward. Okay. Now if you super boring if the current average for the same as what happened in 2000 and I be super excited to see either an increase or decrease in x  Because it would help me decide if global warming was real. No, that's not what it does.  Or if technology makes a difference before you collected I just based on things it would be reasonable. Now you go get 20 Runners because that's the most you can really handle cuz you know technology is exhausting and you find X bars 3.8.  With s Quebec the standard deviation is .5 so it's probably hours, you know Marathon times.  Obviously, that number is bigger.  But is it bigger because we got 20 random people that just were a little slower.  Or is it bigger? Because there really is something fundamentally different about the current year.  Let's go find out if this number is so different from 3.683 that it couldn't possibly.  We can possibly a 3.683 going on. So first thing let's draw a picture of what's going on in the original setting. We're currently in an hour's we currently believe H. Not got to believe something in life. Right? So I am desperately hoping to see valleys near 3.683, but I saw 3.8. Whoops. I'm shading to the right. I'm cleaning the symmetric place over here, and I'm shading to the left.  Now I stay here. This is a t distribution and I'm using 19 is the degree of freedom because that is the most precise curved because of some horrible 7-page proof.  Now you always need to move to a standardized setting.  Because T distributions are set up to be centered at 0 and less you finally learn about non-central t distributions in chapter 17 of some horrible book somewhere.  And these are very very messy. So just move everything to a standardized setting.  Okay. So now this is our good old friendly t-distribution that we are comfortable with and tables are made based on and in order to make that transformation you do what we always do take the points in question on the horizontal axis. What's 3.8 Subtract with value think it's the center of the distribution cuz you're currently believing in it 3.683 in / the standard deviation of this weird complicated thing called the sampling distribution, which is the standard deviation / \u221a 10.5 / Route 20. Now you can convert either of those two numbers either the 3.566 or 3.8 when you convert them, they turn into negatives each other. So you've effectively  Converted the other also.  Now one day many many years from now.  You will learn that the true picture here is not a beautifully symmetric things Anon central T distribution when it's not centered is Eros actually slightly skewed but you don't to worry about all this complicated this now get yourself over to this pretty picture and then use tables or technology to figure out this area. Does it look like enough area?  To keep the Knoll does it look like small enough area to move to the alternative? Let's go find out if I actually calculating this now. I usually do this in Barre the easiest thing.  Just double one of those areas and you get what you want in life. So hear the P value is .31.  Our results was only among the 31% strangest things we could have got if the world really is centered at this three point.  683  that's not a very strange thing.  At all, so I'm going to keep the null hypothesis. You can use do not reject if you like to be double negativity, but I prefer keep.  now if you've ever wondered why some of you probably taking stop before and you probably learned like reject the null or fail to reject anyone heard this  horrible, isn't it?  I prefer reject or keep it must clear. The reason people say fail to reject.  It's cuz they want to put some weird language on it. That doesn't make you feel like you're saying the no hypothesis is true.  Because hypothesis testing never proved anything is true. They triangulate you toward a belief system that harmonizes with the data you're getting from the universe.  Nothing about truth in there and people thought fail to reject would be weird enough. The people be like, it's not true.  I don't know but that's historically what happened. If you want to know why it's so weird. Now, let's say you don't have a fancy computer on the exam if you want to do this with technology. What happened?  Okay, so you going to look up your 1.04 6 on the appropriate curve? So you're on 19 now? Luckily. This table has a 19 row.  You think they printed a row for all possible values?  That's Infinity Rose, which requires Infinity Pages which requires Infinity Adams done Universe depleted for your table.  If there is not a row for what you care about go to a nearby row I don't care if you go up I don't care if you go down. We're arguing over hundreds or thousands go to a nearby right now here. We have a 19. So there we are now 1.046. That's right there.  It's off the table.  Which means when you go up here and you look for the two tails area your area is more than point to cuz the lesson 2.2 stuff is over here on the right so it's got to be more then.  I don't know its exact value from a table person. I just know it's more than point two and last time I checked into was greater than .05, which is all I really care about in life.  So again, we're going to keep giving these data from the 20 people. It's reasonable to keep believing in what we believe in.  That I want to show you the actual results of Boston Marathon times.  To show you that the data scientist person can be much better than the statistician on this kind of problem. The data scientist person will go plot lots of data and explore what's going on with data and see quite quickly down here at the bottom are the Boston Marathon times and you see from year to year. There is incredible variation.  And there's even a little note extreme heat led to remarkably slower time put into the grass.  So you see if your data scientist that the thing that dictates faster or slower primarily is the weather outside and for you to go try to worry about whether the shoes or the gravel or ocean is making a difference is totally missing the point that the other factors that come into play here are much more dramatic.  This is one reason why do scientists are starting to become valuable because they think about things like this.  Anywho, we're going to stop there. Have a great weekend.  I'll see y'all later.
