    "Full Transcript": "Welcome everyone.  Can you hear me in the back row?  Anyone in the back row? Hello. Thank you. Well, welcome to math 183 and the largest lecture hall on campus 417 seats. You've made it to something big.  My name is David corporate. You can call me Professor corporate or DQ or whatever you want. I don't really care.  I am an assistant teaching Professor here. That means that I focus most of my time on teaching and pedagogy and studying how people do that and how to make that better.  If you've never had a teaching professor before it's helpful to contrast it with a research Professor. These are people of the University that tried to advance a field or at the Forefront of it. And most of their time is spent in that Universe. You need both kinds of professors to make a truly cutting-edge University work like UCSD. So I hope I can bring you something that would be quite valuable for you this quarter math. 183 is one of my favorite three courses to teach her and this is my third year and I've been teaching for 20 years now. So it's a pleasure to be in front of this classroom. So let's get going fast here. You're going to find it. I do a lot convey a lot in a very short amount of time. That's how my brain works. I suppose. So first of all everything you need.  But importantly they will be the Electric Slide released 24 hours in advance and one thing you may want to do with your life as you may want to change how you approach learning things when slides are presented in advance, and maybe you don't want to try to copy down everything that happened so fast in here, maybe one of some things. In your notes in case with a different approach to do it doing things. You can also get the podcast online. So if we're going to have to miss some class you can just go watch it and you'll have to miss anything and you don't have to send me an email. Okay. I have 850 students this quarter. Please be very very careful about any email you decide that you need to send me.  Okay other things up there, you'll find all the homework sets all the important documents instructions for how to get yourself working in the programming language are which is what we use in this course, eventually, my office hours will be up there and we'll be exam at Ariel's. I post all my old exams. You don't need to go to tag or course hero or any of that nonsense figure out how to study for something. It'll all be there with Solutions. So you're in good shape for that. First thing people care about grades two ways of calculating grades in this course, which ever formula gives you the better grade is the one you will get individually chosen. Okay. So pretty standard homework sets two exams and a final I don't get makeup exams. So if you miss exam 1 or exam 2 for any reason, you'll just automatically move over to formula to cuz it'll give you a better score formula to just cares about your highest exam score and then the other exam that you're missing just gets replaced basically with the final exam.  The grade scale is pretty standard and this curtain discussed tends to have almost no curve. Sometimes I prove it because I'm so impressed with how hard people worked but I don't need a curve it to bring the grades up. That's for sure. So anyhow,  If you get out your cell phone you can go to your app store and we will be downloading Socrative. This is a piece of software that we use in class for real-time answering.  And this is a lot better than other kinds of in class clicker Technologies because you can do things Beyond just multiple choice questions. You can actually text me some response about your thinking I can collect your data in real-time and we can go push it over into our or other some other statistical software in just a matter of seconds. So it gives you a better voice and what's clearly a very large class.  Okay, so more on that in a second next in calendar, you'll notice from this that everything in blue is what we do during class the things in red or the homework assignments. So this class 10-step homework do twice a week.  The reason for that is because basically all evidence around homework. I'll Studies have shown that giving homework more often in smaller Amounts is far superior to giving a few our homework assignments that are bigger. You will be thinking about statistics almost every day for the next ten weeks because of this structure. Also, this course has notoriously a lot of homework. I'm sure you've already seen that on all the sites. That's because I push people really hard and I want you to really learn things. I write all my own homework sets. I make 16 or 17 new ones every single quarter and they're all usually five or six pages. So you're not going to be able to just look everything up on course hero and Chegg and type something to Google. Everything is non Google Bowl. So don't waste your time actually spend your time trying to learn how to do things. That's what's important. I try to bring in really relevant examples things like experience in my life. I keep a list on my phone always of things.  Come up that I think would be interesting for this class. And that is a source of a huge amount of what's going on. I think you're going to really like no more problems. I think the most interesting things out there.  And will open your mind to statistics being used in the real world, which is what I want to do with this class exams here. You can see you're in class in this room. So there's no special time for any of that you just show up here on the normal day and will be 50 minutes long and discussion sections are right here are these required no, nothing in life is required do whatever they want. Whatever you want for the rest your life. But if you're about to say I'm not going to discussion section and you're going to throw away one of your four hours a week with some extra person in a field that seems like a pretty silly choice to me. So I leave it to you most disgusting sections will focus on helping you answer some homework questions giving you problems to work on and teaching you more things had to do things in our so if you're not a computer science major, they're particularly important for you. Also, you should know that a large percentage of people in this room or CS majors. And so all of the computer science aspects of what's going on, which is width statistics requires will be trivial for them and hard for you.  There are other things that you might be good at that they're not so you should just be aware of the challenges that you're going to face that may be unique to you. Now, the homework assignments are a little complicated.  There's a pipeline you should always go onto the internet on Triton Ed and print off the PDF for some homework assignment. You will now have physical paper in front of you. You will write on this you will feel in the solutions directly there. Then that you will scan that document reader PDF. Maybe we'll take pictures with your cell phone. There's instructions online on how to do this and then you will upload it to this thing called gradescope, which is a web weed management system. Then a bunch of portier and pour graders will go through 370 students.  x five or six pages x 15 to 17 homework assignments  Everything will get graded every single problem. Just so you know. Okay. So there you go. Too bad grades go for exams, which will love what is designing a class. I made a choice. I wanted everything to be free.  And that's a big decision when the end value of people in the room is to three or four hundred people take four hundred and multiply that by say $200.  You just made a huge Monumental financial decision in the lives of people so because of that.  Cuz I wanted it to be free we're going to be using this book called open intro stats actually a very good book. It's interesting. They've good examples and it's basically equivalent to all the books that cost $150. This is part of the openintro series where people decided to get together and write free textbooks and stop all this nonsense from the Publishing Company.  Okay, next rstudio are was chosen as the language for this because guess what it's free. It is also one of the two main languages used by Professionals in Academia and business the other being python so you can think about math 183 is a pair of the mouth 11, they both introduce statistics and probability Theory and those are sort of parallel to 20 and 10 series for calculus. This class does things that are more complicated your heart problems. Use more serious statistical software to do your things.  So it makes sense that the 23 is a prerequisite for this because you're going to be experiencing that level of things also gradescope, which is where all this homework submission happens is also going to be free. So if I was a lot there's a nice little teddy list for me to take a picture with your cell phone of what to think about and what start doing.  You're probably not going to time to write it and it's also in the exercise if you want to go take a look later, but this is where I would get going.  Starting the first homework, which is nothing more than a test of the pipeline's organs. Like oh, yeah. I can do the pipeline. So not really 15 homework that says really just fourteen ya.  You should go to your prescribed discussion section.  .  Except if there is a rare one-of-a-kind incident that's going to cause you to have to miss one. And then for that one time you can go to a different one.  And you don't need to send me an email because I get 200 a day.  Now eventually you'll see just got some sections 10 to have them with no one in them. Okay. I don't know why that's not my choice when things are getting to that State of Affairs. I would say it's fine to go to someone else's nothing in discussion sections. It's greater required you to be a certain one. I want people to learn the most possible. Now if I say everyone can go do whatever they want. Everyone's at the 3 p.m. One, right?  Okay, so you should use it sparingly and try to respect everybody else and I just think about you. Imma just like everyone should think about that right? It's a great question.  So one thing about homework that always comes up all the time is due dates. So the calendar will tell you that homework to do at 9 p.m. On Sunday and you should get it in by 9 p.m. Now, of course the World falls apart, right?  Internet stops working your car breaks down whatever. I don't care personal problems, right? So I have the system allow people to turn things in up to 2 hours late. Then it locks you out. You will not be able to submit anything under any circumstance sending it to me. I will delete the email without responding just so you know, it's one of those two hundred that I don't respond to. Okay. This is an absolute.  Deadline and I do this not because I care.  About having absolute deadlines. I think that's actually a bad idea my but I think it's good for you to train and to understand this so that when you get into the real world in a year or two and you see your first absolute real deadline you like. Wow, this really means something also this system won't allow me very easily to go and put things in late. It's very cumbersome. So it's just not really functional from my end.  Okay, serious 9 p.m. No joke, let's start enough talking about nonsense. Let's talk about things that are interesting and valuable. So first thing chapter 1 is all about data describing data visualizing data in this is where it all begins because statistics is fundamentally about understanding data.  So what you see here is a beautiful little spreadsheet.  You can call this a date of Matrix if you want or dataframe, which is what most people in our tender refer to it as it's nothing more than a collection of data about something. Now. This is about 50 different emails. So every row that you see here is a collection of information about a single email. So I took making up the Rose The Columns are just a bunch of things. You might want to measure about emails. Okay. So for example spam whether the spam detector decided this was a Spam message or not. They've been encoded as a zero to one you could also use. Yes and no but it's easier for people just use your own one because then you can do things with numbers like average them much more difficult to average a bunch of yeses together. So every row is called an observation and every column will be known as a variable. This is the number of characters in the email.  In thousands, which is why you see things that are decimals. Okay * 1000 and then you will get yourself to the true number of characters letters that appeared in the message.  So the first thing you want to do it everyday to set is understand it and understanding data. If you've never thought about this before there was a macro structure to all data that exists in the world and pay the first macro breakdown you can do is whether your data is fundamentally Numerica nature. Some people say quantitative.  Or whether it's not an American nature people will say categorical or qualitative. Now within the number Universe you seen lots of numbers in your life data.  Have numbers and you're only going to get discrete values to speed means there's space between things for example, the integers or discrete set of numbers there space between one and nothing in between them if you're just thinking about the integers.  The other possibility is a continuous numeric variable so you can see here values are real numbers. Okay, so if something has the ability to take on the value 1.79 to 4 that thing is a continuous numeric variable. For example, my water usage.  It's something could never take on a fractional amount. For example, the number of human beings. I'm friends with.  Vanessa discrete variable  and it's important to distinguish between them because the way that you deal with these sorts of data and model them is fundamentally different. It may not feel that way right now. And in fact, sometimes we switch between these worlds. You know, how old am I I'm 39. Well, am I really 39 know I'm like 39.86 to for whatever and years. So we go back and forth all the time. Sometimes surrounding things. They filled the streets are there Dental for our souls and sometimes you're honest about with something really is like when you get your electricity bill and its rounded up in 19 decimal places and they're getting as much money as I can so I can see how you can go through these different variables in our email data set and you could try to decide what are they in numeric terms also the qualitative there two kinds of qualitative.  Date is out there. So one is  if you think about categorical data, this is data that fits into categories or bins. You can think of finite number pots in front of you and you're going to put this data into one of those pots. Okay. So for example here if it has a finite number of categories, and there's no way to order it. This is called nominal for example gender if you believe in a binary gender  Which I think is a foolish idea, but let's just say it for a moment. Okay, so we got this email and his female category there who the two bins of finitely many and there's no natural ordering to sign between them.  Or at least I hope you wouldn't do such a thing.  Now it's not clear immediately what the natural state of some variable is is gender really a binary.  That's super complicated. I don't know. I'm not a biologist. Okay, so and all sorts of other variables are complicated to know sometimes there's a finite number Bend and you can put them in an order for everyone in the room. If I put SML in Excel in front of you would put the less than sign between S&M and say small is smaller than medium and medium is smaller than large. And so I know exactly how much less I don't know but you could put them in an order and there's finitely many bins into which you put things so there is an example of something that's ordinal. It can be ordered as the name suggests nominal at Canobie. Namdar named  The male been the female been so here we go attachments the number of attached files to an email. So I said this was discreet. You can't have one point seven of them and it definitely feels Numerica nature.  Okay. The other idea here is Viagra the number of times Viagra the word appeared in the email.  Seems like an integer idea to me, right? So that's also discreet. Okay, here's a continuous one the time at which the email was sent. No, unfortunately we tend to round stuff in life.  And that makes it feel discreet when people ask you your classes. It's like a one and a three and a disease or rounded write me to happen to start there, but never have a class. It was like 12:01. It was just a silly idea.  At its heart what is this thing could truly be any value now? It's time to Street or not is a question for all your theoretical physicist in the room. I don't know but for me time is a continuous variable just plows through any possible value. Okay, then we have this one indicator for whether anyone was cc'd on the message. Okay, so this can only take so many values. Yes, and no you can code them a zero and one but that doesn't make it numeric change your thinking numerically. There's these two bins. Okay nominal means. I don't think I can order them.  Okay, is it yes, there was an email attached better than no.  I don't like getting attachments. This is virus prone, right that is not actually a natural thing. Even if you encoded as a zero and one that's just you choosing something to be zero on one. It's not natural to it.  Now you have to be really careful as you're thinking about the macro structure of variables because there are a lot of little issues. First of all not all variables that look like numbers actually are I just gave you that indicator variable with something is in code is your one but you can really destroy people on exam by asking about area codes look like numbers aren't they?  But when I taste x19, you don't think 619 you think?  San Diego  is anyone call anyone anymore?  No dices, I shoulda known of silly of me. Okay, not all things new mayor of types look like numbers so you can have a time and coat it in some weird format.  Let me not feel numeric DUI, January 7th 1962.  Set the only married to you.  Maybe not but it is encoding some sort of time idea. Okay. Anyhow, so this divide is going to affect everything we do. So keep this in your head as we go forward two types of visualization to use for these data are different the way you model them probabilistically different and so on. So, for example, let's just take this your categorical data things that fit into nice bins if you want to display one thing one variable you would just use a bar chart for example, the gender variable if you believe in binaries, you have a male baby of a female BEN you raise up the bins based on how many people write maybe you've never thought about a bar chart before is the realization of one categorical variable. That's exactly what it is.  Now if you have two of them you crave is called a contingency table is just a table that lists how people fall into things will see that now over on the numeric side. We use histograms to display things that have one variable in Scatter Plots for to all those words are different right and a fundamental you're doing something different with data a different kind of day to go into them in case one of the biggest mistakes you see in newspapers that people using the wrong kind of visualization on some data set cuz I don't understand this fundamental divide. Okay. So let's look at some categorical data in more detail more stuff. You've seen indicator variables the yes or no becoming 011 if you want I wanted to show you one that we do all the time. We hit exhausted in life. So the number of siblings does a human being could have that should be a numeric discrete variable. I could have zero you could have 14 you could have 900 siblings.  Okay, now can you really attain some of these values a billion? I don't know. There's something called 9 months and finite life spans or whatever. But and at some point you don't really care about the difference between 14 and 15 siblings may be in your study. Okay, so you can do this thing really like 12012 mini group all those other people together into one big group. So they really are finite number Ben's here. They're called 0 1 2 and 3 plus  So what was Indiscreet numeric variable suddenly being thought of his categorical just because the researcher wanted to not saying it's a good idea or bad. It is exhausting. Okay. So here's part of this dataset. We're going to take a little look here. One thing you might want to do is going to our and this is your first example of our code. It's what follows this little greater than sign here. You can put the word table and you can put it on any value as there any variable now variables are called him and somehow you have to get to it will every call him should have a name in your data set. So this is the column without attachments known as attached.  And that variable is part of some larger dataframe the big Matrix to hold it all so that's called emails for me. She always do the name of the date of frame a dollar sign which means select out the one thing I care about and it's just going to pull this one column called attachment 002000 * 1  what makes a table and I'll say I'm going to look through your whole thing and see what the finite bins are. Just going to go to the list of all the bins that are there. So I found the bin 0 1 and 2 and it will tell you how many are in each of those. Okay. So most of these emails 47 of them had no attachments. That's just what this data said happened to look like if you want to make a bar chart of this and visualize it because you believe in the human visual complex having superiority over the numeric  Complex of this then we can go make bar plot and you just go plug in a table to it. And it does Eliza's the table. Now, you can visually see how much more the zero category had if you have trouble understanding base 10 notation. Okay. There you go.  So were usually going to be interested in counts. When we do this kind of categorical variables. How many women are in this class? But you can also always convert that question to a percentage question what percentage of the class is female or identifies as female in some binary scale?  So we're going to go back and forth the question of whether you should use tables to display your data or visualisations is one argued about by Scholars. And I think we should just use boats.  Now if you have two variables that you're measuring on every object or observation and they're both categorical.  Then you can go make with call the contingency table. So this is a two by two or three by two or whatever is appropriate table it simply put every single one of your observations into one of the cells. So across the top we are looking at whether the email was sent to multiple people are not that's a categorical variable only two possible values. Yes or no contaban coated them by an indicator variable the number of attachments. Well, you might think that's discrete numeric and it really is but in our data set there only three possible values 01 into so it feels a little categorical doesn't it? That's fine. We'll just treat a categorically  Okay. So every email now is in one of these six spots here depending on whether it was sent to multiple people and how many attachments has once you made the table. You can also make the margins. Okay. That's what this song Calling is. So 47 of these emails had no attachments, which is what we saw earlier. Okay. All you have to do is add across the row to get this margin or you can head down to call him to get that. Margin. Okay this number right here should be the total number of things a new dataset.  It's the sum of all the stuff's in the Rose or all the stuff in the columns.  Have a cool thing about these sorts of tables as you can start asking questions like our email sent to multiple people more likely to have attachments.  One might argue. Yes. This makes sense. When you sending some multiple people you're trying to transmit large amounts of information and you often need to do this with attachments or email the people tend to be spam in Spanish and stab attachments with viruses and sort of answer that so the question is how does one answer this using this data set?  So first thing you could do if you could say I want to look at the emails that were just sent to a single person that this First Column here was it sent to multiple people 0 equals. No, so we're in this car.  Okay, and if you look at this call and you said will how many of that of that column had attachments b-1b a hundred? I don't know how many attachments so here I go there 43 Things in this column and there was one with one attachment in one or two. So 2 out of 43 of those messages were attached.  Now you can do the same thing with the snacks column mk7 of our messages were multiple sent to multiple people and if you look at how many had had some attachment you're going to get one out of seven here. So really does seem like if an email was sent to lots of people it's going to be a pachy in nature.  Is what this is saying be careful. This is based off 50 emails sent a one human being probably don't want to generalize that to everything in life.  That's going to be a caution for the rest of the class more on that later. Okay now on things.  And hence, you may not have actually seen some of this before Evelyn's room. It's in a bar chart right important thing is got switch to realize that it was a visualization of a categorical variable. That's what you may not have realized before. So here. We are me spending money at Chipotle I go to Chipotle a lot. I record how much I spend every time I go. Well when I was making this I did and you can see how much I spend now. This is a numeric variable it could take on basically any possible value. Yes, we round to the nearest cent in America, but it's okay. It basically has enough decimal places that you feel like you can get most of the values. Okay, you don't get everything possible, but it's good enough so you don't have to put these in  Unless you make the beans yourself.  Okay, and that's how histogram works you say? I'm going to take this numerical variable that lives over all real numbers are all positive numbers or whatever and I'm just going to break the access into little zones and within a little zone. I'll just count up how many of the Chipotle expenditures were in that zone.  So here I broke it up by dollar.  627-728-8829 and so on and here you can see that there are three different blocks of area and those are for the three different times. I went to Chipotle and spent between 12 and $13 in example of 12.65.  And you just build up the heights. I need to become effectively your bins.  They're just all right next to each other now in a bar chart you put a little space between them cuz they are disjoint objects. They differ from each other.  Okay, you'll notice that you can have blank spaces. For example, I have a hard time spending between 13 and $14 at Chipotle.  I don't know why giving the stuff I ordered that's just me. You want some to decide if you're going to include or exclude the left and right down that make up your bin. You just have to do this in a consistent way. So I decided I would always include the thing to the last Min X clue the thing to the right to the next bend over goes from Seven inclusive to eight xclusive doesn't matter what you choose it's a random choice and usually you're dealing with data sets that have millions of data points or thousands only care. If one goes this way or the other if it lands right on where you want to cut that bin, it's totally irrelevant, basically.  So there's a histogram. I think it's time for you to give me some of your yummy data. We're going to use for Kratom, which is hopefully download it to your phone unless we broke the wireless.  So here's we're going to do check your phone. How many people have you had text correspondence with?  So far today.  What we're going to do is you're going to send me that number.  interpretive  number of textese  Here we go.  As you log into the room again the room name is DQ my initials.  What's going on?  Oops, did I do a true false question?  What's going on in your end?  No reception. No one's in the room. Let's finish. Let's just reload this. I don't know what just happened short answer.  number textese  Push it out.  Is anyone in the room?  They work. How come nothing showing up?  Oh my goodness. Are you in?  Never tried this with 370 people before I think you broke the internet.  Okay. Well, who knows what's going on? I tired of waiting. So pretend you just gave me all of your yummy data.  Okay, here's all your yummy data. Thanks.  Don't think I'm prepared for this kind of thing. Come on. Okay, so when you download all your data, you'll see lots of answers here, right? So first thing you want to do it every day to clean this hot mess.  And this is not an easy process. If you want to be a data scientist, you're going to spend a lot of time cleaning data sets.  Person have to do are there any values that couldn't possibly mathematically occur. If someone paid -14 for example.  That would make no sense. Right you clear those out if there's nothing there you can clear that out. Then you have hard choices. Like what do you think about that? 160?  So we're going to choose you. You have to beat the decider. Delete or keep and why?  Delete because it's an outlier. Okay, you don't delete things just because there are outliers outliers can still be correct valuable honest data.  She got to give me a different reason.  Or now you can keep it if you want.  You still want to delete but why?  Every action you take you have to have a reason.  You're going to have what do you want to do?  Well depends This is complicated.  Do you like that idea? The person was confused. They sent 260 text today. Maybe it's just a for 5 people.  Okay, so you had to make a decision but this is dangerous of course and there's no right answer here. For example, I did this experiment in the past the number 54 was up there the class argued about whether to keep it or toss it when someone raises their hand, they said I'm the 54. I texted every single one of my IRA people in my dorm. There's first day of school. They showed me their phone. They really did.  Okay. So this is complicated every time you try outdated you are changing the dataset you are putting your judgment on it. Okay now an outlier so ridiculous of an outlier that I don't actually believe it's possibly true. So I'm going to delete it just like you would delete it.  That was a good choice.  Now I imagine you also want to delete 3:30.  Okay, we can take a look through now. Sometimes people will get confused and will type words when you want numbers all sorts of things. You do. People are just make a big hot mess of every day to set some people want to be clowns and so they weren't roll. And so that's why they type 330. I don't know the intent of everything. Now one thing you can do is just change their data to some other number. Maybe you think it's a typo. Maybe they meant okay you can make that choice is a good is it bad super complicated depends on the setting? Okay. I'm just going to change it to 25 for fun. And it looks like the rest of the data set is good.  now the next thing we need to do is get this into our  okay, so that's not so easy to do.  Data management is so here's what I'm going to do. I'll show you we're going to make a new Excel workbook here.  It helps if you title your columns are likes to have titled variables when you bring it in, okay?  ctrl-c ctrl-v  Now I'm going to save this there lots of different file formats out there. Right? So let's just put this somewhere. It doesn't really matter.  How about the desktop?  Will call this text to you.  When you say that, you have to choose a file format. Now a CSV file transfer, separated values. Is there a standard type of dataset it basically just has a piece of data, then another piece of data Nana, and so on now doesn't actually have to be a, as the name would imply you can use any delimiter for example a space but some of these are more and less dangerous depending on the nature of your data.  Okay, so I'm just going to use CSV. Here we go. Save it up.  Excel wants to force me into using their format once again.  Dangerous to use something that's not Excel. They say now it looks like it's called rstudio. This is a integrated development environment a pretty little thing for us to look at that leaves a top the our language helps us right code in it. Some of you probably use your Clips to write Java or use Sublime to write HTML when I go to website, it was bootstrap HTML done through Sublime. So there you go. Okay for Windows here most important Windows lower left where you can type single lines of code. You want to write you can write the whole scripts or collection zip code. So they're very much a scripted language if you know the distinction, okay upper right here, which is very small right now is a list of all your data sets that you brought in and then lower right is a help where you can read about the things you can do in our just by typing? And whatever it is you want to know about in are you can change the size of all of these by just dragging  If you can see, I've all sorts of datasets in here import different on Apple versus PC and what version of things you have just try to do some bass level importing the dataset. Okay. You have to go find it.  on your computer  It's on the desktop. Here we go it love CSV files. It will tell you what how it's going to try to structure the big hot mess you gave it and you can see it just wants to make a boring dataframe identifying with one column, which is not what they typically look like. They have lots of columns Bridge right there. Okay decide do my data have headings or not. Okay, if it doesn't have a heading it'll just make a variable name called V1 cuz it has no idea what you want to do. Now. You can see the line of code. It actually just ran down here at the bottom. If you ever want to know how do you like physically type things in to make this happen but 99% of the time I type the line of code mice are I go to import instead of doing it myself.  Okay. So now you have a dataframe called text he's  If you want to pull out a particular column you type the dollar sign. This only has one column. It also happens to be named textese is a very bad way to do things to not to think which between the dataframe name and one of the columns once you type that dollar sign it will autocomplete here. You can see and say hey, I know some things in that dataset one is called capital T text to use if you hit enter it was bring it up. Okay. So if I hit enter you can see there's all the data just listed across OK and there's over a hundred of these things. If you want to do something with it, then you just go do something like maybe want to make a histogram of that dataset. So hist is how you do this in our and you can see it made a histogram.  Do you love are histogram?  Most of you don't text many people by 1 in the afternoon. That's good. I like that.  So it made a choice on how to bend things. You can go change how bidding is done. If you want it tried to do what it thought was most natural. They're going to know how to use something? And then it's named as I'm doing right here. What it will do is bring up the documentation file for this method histograms how to make a histogram. You can see all the crud. You can pay to this function to get more functionality out of it. You can read the description of all those different parameters and how to use them down here and usually at the bottom there a bunch of examples that you can go run you can see how things are used.  So if you set things up nicely with r and rstudio, this is all integrated. I'm trying so anyhow there we've made our first histogram based on your data.  how internet  don't you have a pretty little picture you'd like to be able to talk about it. This is the next thing you want to do in life. So we need some language talk about histograms. This will be vague emotional non precise.  That's fine. When you talk to people who aren't Quan people they want none for size things. First of all, you might care about how many humps or Peaks it has this graph on the upper left has none. It's basically flat most of the time so we describe that is uniform. It is uniformly high same height. If the graph has one Peak you can say you in a modal uni meaning one Moto meaning of High Point or most frequently occurring thing.  If it has two humps, you can go by and once it gets beyond that just say multi and stop being pedantic. I don't need to know what is 17 Peaks. I'm fine with knowing that has more than two. So there's our multimodal result.  Next thing you want to do is talk about its symmetry. So this is pretty picture in front of you. Can you take it and fold it in half somewhere so that it lands back on top of itself does the left side of things look the same as the right side. So here are these two things are called the tails for the graphed drops off and starts to vanish. So if you folded right along than mode hear a two tails with land roughly on top of each other not exactly. That's fine.  Okay, this is asymmetric. There's no way to fold it to get a look the same and this shows that a bimodal graph can be symmetric hear the two humps land on each other when you fold it across the middle. So it's not just a term for Unum Auto Glass. Now. If you have something that you can do better than telling me, it's asymmetric that just says it ain't pretty ain't pretty so they left and right side right? So if the right side drag on forever and goes a long distance, you can say it's skewed right like someone took the right side into pole dance cute it that way you can skate skiing positively if you insist but I think that language is left helpful. You're something that skewed left.  This is the age of female cardiac patients at a hospital. Okay here there's a sort of tied up everything sort of crowds up against that and thanks for the spew out over to the left as you get somewhere examples of 20 and 30 year olds with cardiac events. So there's a skewed left graph and a skewed right that actually appear in practice. Now you mention the word outlier earlier. So an outlier is not necessarily a good or bad thing remove the Judgment from life. It's just a thing that stands apart from most of the other stuff. Sometimes you love the idea of an outlier if your salary were one on the upper end.  Okay, sometimes you don't.  Again, the definition is Big. It's a collection of data points, or maybe just a single one. That stands apart hear that white space right there is enough for me to feel like that is an outlier. You can mathematize the definition of outlier, but then you're just making arbitrary choices about how far away it has to be and then you're supplying your arbitrariness which doesn't make it any less arbitrary. So you need to accept the fact that when you do statistics you're in the real world, which is messy and complicated and dirty and there are Infinity choices that you have to make.  None of which for which there are any good answers if you want theoretical Nana, there's plenty of that at this University. So I spend my time half and half in each World C reticle math and applied statistics and you just have to accept that they're different beasts. Okay. Let's see if you can name some outliers or quantitative thing. I want to measure is how many medals a random Olympian has one and I want you to tell me something that's an outlier.  Phelps 119 he would be way over here. Most people win 0  Okay, Instagram followers.  Kardashian  Damn, that's good. Stacy bad taste in the mouth, you know.  I just lots of examples of outliers, right? I don't know them all. I'm not on social media. Okay. So if we go back to her text count histogram you can now use all of this pretty little language to talk about it. We're going to need someone to help us talk about it.  Bring it up, Tell me what you think is your hand. You're the chosen one.  Go ahead.  skewed right and  modality  in the model and outliers  maybe that  What about that?  I don't know.  Whatever you say I was going to say fine.  Okay, there we go. It's intentionally vague language so I can embrace it.  That's good.  So far no one's gotten anything wrong in class, right?  100% accuracy so far for the class. I can't wait till it changes. I'mma start acting hard thing soon scatter plot from our email dataset. You have to choose something to go on the horizontal axis. It doesn't matter what this is how many characters were in the email and this is measured in thousands. Okay. So this is 30000 characters were in this will let you know right there and over here is the number off of line breaks carriage return and turkey how many times you move to a new line? You think that these would be related write the longer that thing is the more time you hit enter. Okay. So this you can see that naturally because the points go up into the right really and we've discovered something amazing here. So the thing I wanted to point out is all the mean things of this first of all every. Here  Could be filled in or is empty and this picture is just some email you measured this email on two different dimensions. Okay, the thing down here on the horizontal axis is called the explanatory variable maybe in math class. You called the independent variable and a machine-learning class. She would call it something else. OK it's trying to hopefully help you explain or understand something on the other axis.  So that's known as the response variable. It's responding to changes in the thing in the horizontal axis.  Next thing you see all these beautiful Dots here. They happen to follow a linear Trend which means they roughly all on the line. We don't need to be super precise. But anytime you see some sort of pattern in these be a linear or not you have what's called an association, which is a pattern among the data points that your variables that are being plotted are associated in some way the dots just looks like pure noise like pennies thrown off the Empire State Building and you look down on them.  Then the variables have nothing to do with each other. They don't have any interaction or connection because there's a. Everywhere so that's called independent variables don't influence each other and we're going to see about to be examples of dependent what is things with associations and independent things and it's the same bag thing. If your data point stands apart from the big Trend you see going on how far will leave it up to him. You are decider about fairness for the rest of the quarter. Okay. You should just sit there always so I remember where you are.  Okay. Now one of the troubles is the following this will be our last night for the day. It's very dangerous to think that when you see an association when you see a pattern in the data that this implies a causal relationship between things.  That's not true at all and people will say that causal thinking is when you say the thing one variable forcibly implies changes in the others.  Which may not be the case they can just friend together in life.  For example the amount of damage done by a fire friends with how many firefighters show up.  But those are not causal. They're not implicated if I send more firefighters through the fire. It doesn't make it worse.  And you can't make it better by sending none. They trained together because the Blaze and its strength is dictating both of them simultaneously. That's the causal link there. So just because you see an association or a pattern in your data. It's not doesn't mean it's causal and we'll figure out how to deal with cars with things on Monday. Have a good weekend.  UC San Diego podcast "
