Like number eight is probably in the top five hardest problems, but I'll ask this quarter. So I don't want you to feel like this is hopeless. I just want you to know like there's a range of difficulty here. I just want you to feel that and just be honest with you. So we're ready to move forward here. So we got so far. We don't have that much to be honest. We know how to find the probability of an event a or possibly also an event to be occurring you would be excited about both of them and it just turned out to be the sum, but there was only two events are disjoint.  I know most people in the room will naturally because you're 20 series Suits student still say I could just generalize that if I had lots of events and they were all disjoint. None of them had any overlap with any of the others.  Then if I want to know the probability that any of them occur, I'll just add up all the individual probabilities.  Is a natural generalization you might make based on a fact and you can prove this using induction. That's how one would show something like this. We also saw that if you want to events to both happen you want and between them and you excited about their intersection. Basically, you can multiply them as long as the events are independent.  And you might guess then if we have lots of things and we want them all to happen and none of them have any influence on any of the others.  Then you could just multiply lots and lots of events together could probably use that in one of the homework problems is my guess.  Now we need to talk about what happens when you don't have these pretty words are disjoint and independent because most of the time you don't have these are the ideal cases and that's where you start learning rules in life most of the time. So here's the general rule when you don't know that your events are disjoint when they could have some overlap and you can see that visually in the picture, right? The Venn diagram now has an actual intersection.  So basically she want to know PA or B. Then you're asking for the area of the Snowman shape. That is the overlap of those two things. It's a snowman lying down without a head.  And I claim is probability of a which is the red circles area plus and probably would be which is the blue circle minus the intersection and when you see the picture it's believable because when you do with the red circle you're going to get this is owned right here that I'm calling p a v a n d you're going to grab that and when you do the blue circle, you're going to grab it again. So you've over counted it. So subtracting away the intersection give you the exact amount of snow man without a double stomach.  Okay, that's not so bad right. Now. One of the weird things about this or that I keep mentioning is people often get confused about what or means and the reason is in real life. We use or in different ways and it all you computer science people know about or vs. Xor or exclusive or the computer science has a good job of coming up with language to deal with this class when I say or it could mean a but not B, that's just moon shape right here.  You got to be but not a that's the moon shape up here out of blue cheese, and then and is the intersection. Okay, so a could happen but not be because I haven't been out of a or I'm okay with both of them. I just want one of them to happen at least one is one way to think about this.  And you see an everyday speech disease examples here that sometimes we mean or too mean inclusive which is what we're doing here and sometimes we mean xclusive.  So the best exclusive or is this coffee or tea when you ask someone that question they'll never be like both.  That would feel weird to you. Right you're asking it in such a way that you don't want you want to exclude the possibility that they might say both.  Chipotle McDonald's both  maybe start doing that from now on and you'll feel the difference between an inclusive or which would allow that possibility versus an extrusive are or even tell people don't exclusively or me like that hashtag social justice.  Yeah.  If you got it, if you want exclusive or you don't want to include the possibly that both it happened so would be that red moon shape and that blue moon shape which you could just add both of them and subtract two of these like you said.  That's one way to do it and you could use X or instead of or which is what they do in computer science, but we never do that in this class, so don't worry about that.  Now I'm going to show you an example of a problem here that will feel like something you may have seen and say 3rd grade when you're doing Venn diagrams.  The beauty here is that we need to have nice notation.  This is the issue. I noticed an office hours today is the people were hot mess with defining events and putting notation on things that would help facilitate doing a bunch of probability stuff.  80% of you like learning 70% of you like video games 62% of you like Bose  what percent like learning or video games?  So when you put events down you tend to use a letter of the alphabet that remind you of what the event is about L for learning use capital letters. So everyone knows hey, this is an event and when it's a capital letter, I can put a probability around it is another nice thing just to is a visual reminder.  I'm going to start with the Venn diagram approach to thinking about this here. I've done the L in the B circles. I don't know if they overlap or not, but I'll just draw them as an overlap and it will turn out that they do have an overlap in diagrams the smartest ways to start from the innermost to area the area that lies at the intersection of the most things cuz if you're not told that in the problem you're in big trouble, it's very hard to do a problem without that kind of intersection. So here I told you the 62% of people live in both those worlds.  That is where it gets weird 80% of college students like learning. So what it means is when you look at the learning circle the total amount of stuff in the red hair should be point eight and we've already used up .62 so you can figure out what's remaining by just doing a quick subtraction.  So whenever a fact mentions one of the ideas here learning and doesn't mention the other like 80% of people like learning it means that's the area for the total Circle which might have an overlapped section or Minot.  Finally you can go do the video game part those have to add up 2.7 cuz that's what the blue universe is. And if you want you can also fill in the area outside those circles with the number cuz it's all good. I got up to Uno.  There you go. Now once at some place it's very easy to answer this question.  You just break out the formula for an or I'd like to know if they like learning more video games. I'm okay with both. It's not an excuse of or  and in this case  We have a bunch of these facts at the very beginning with the problem and talk to you even need to draw the Venn diagram here. You don't want to  but epfl is just how much stuff is in the red, which is actually given we work so hard to break it out.  And the TV was also given and we getting we worked way too hard to figure out. Cuz it was already given.  Now if you do write all this the small numbers down then just build the snowman if you want the or okay, you can do Point 1/8 + 2.62 + 2.08 long as you don't double count anything that will get you the Snowman to this calculation is saying I don't care about your visualizations in your snow metaphors. I'm just going to plow through a bunch of simple stuff.  There's value in all of these approaches. It's not an excuse of or  hey go your turn describe to me in words what these things mean .18 who does that describe?  tomorrow is your hand and give us  a little talking to  glad  only liking learning talk to me about video games and learning each.  Like learning a video games you live inside one's own you live outside the other that's what like you not liking .08 plus .62 someone different.  How about something from this section? Go ahead.  Louder, please.  People that like learning and video games those people live at the intersection of those two worlds and that's .62. So there's too many people here for what you said.  Go ahead people that like video games in general and you are not going to discuss learning with me.  Okay, that's just people like video games. Okay. It's about an entire circle. Right? It's this circle right here. So if it's about an entire circle don't even mention the other thing.  Will have words for these you can call marginal probabilities in a second Point 1/2.  Go ahead.  People that like don't like learning or video games. What does that mean or  Can you do without the or word cuz you know how that we're goes in our society. Try again.  Everyone else. What would you say to add onto his idea?  So your name is the word and and he use the word or  It sounds like I said the same thing to me.  Okay. So first of all in everyday life use and sometimes when we met or we mean or if or when we mean and we use oral and Min X or XR and me or  Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Okay. So anyhow, this is what I wrote dislike video games and just like learning. They got to be outside the red circle and outside the blue circle.  So from the probability perspective the word and is the better choice now in everyday life people use or demean and all the time. It is true start watching what people do so I understood what you meant.  Finally this point 1 8 + 1 0 8 someone from the far section cuz we never hear from you.  100 people someone must know  go ahead.  exclusively like learning  exclusively like learning and video games  Did you use and when you mentor?  What is exclusively like something or something mean?  Not both but something they have a little love but not too much.  Okay. So here's some way learning or video games. Not both.  learning only or video games only  it's very weird. So you recognize now. Hopefully the English is a big hot mess.  Everyone is not a native English speaker really notices that because you came to this language you like what?  with all this irregular verb nonsense  What does either or mean?  So in everyday life is someone is like either or I would probably say they probably mean this one or that one but not both. That's what I would probably think they were trying to say, but it's best to try to come up with something that's avoids all the normal ways of saying things because we destroy everything and English.  Okay. Now if you don't like Venn diagrams or feel to 3rd grade each of you we can get dance here and use a contingency table.  So this is a way of organizing the exact same information but slightly differently. Okay. So across the top you will have the idea about say learning or video games or sorry about it. You'll have the lady about one of them video games and you have sort of a yes or no. Do you like it or you're not the other access will be the other idea?  And then you can fill it all the numbers and you can see that the four numbers I wrote here are the four numbers that go in the table.  They are the numbers that describe the most honed in zoomed-in ideas that are possible. Whereas the other things that we are given like Point 17.8. Turn out to live on the margins when you add Down The Columns or across the rose.  So because of this presentation people have words like joint probability and marginal probability. So joint probability is a number that lives in the central core of the table not on the margin images to join or the union of a row and a column and you're looking at that spot where they joined together.  And a marginal probability is something that lives on the margin.  Another cool thing about a contingency table is it's just a little better than a Venn diagram. It shows everything at once.  You can see all the individual numbers we saw before and in addition you can see the things I gave you which were all marginal probabilities for the most part 2.7.8.  So some people love these question up there.  Okay. So this is some English thing neither nor either or whatever. I don't know. I can't even remember anymore all this I just tried to speak in ways that everyone could absolutely understand and I'm also not going to put a problem on an exam to say give me the English way of saying this because that disadvantages all non-native speakers and it's English is so broken that like we're so worried right now, right? Yeah, so I don't know about know where is also like it's a computer science term with its definition there and whatever.  So you should distinguish marginal and Joint probabilities. They're easy to see in the table.  Okay, the marginal probability in a Venn diagram out of all the credit in the circle just to get it.  So, let's see two minutes. Can you do this think fast here we go.  Don't copy all these words down just start working and thinking and cognize thing.  Take one of the ideas Twitter put it on the top put it on the left side. I don't care wherever you put it it gets a yes and a no.  The other idea put it on the other place. Give it a yes and a no or use or not use or whatever 20 use both joint idea what you're talking about both of them. So it should be inside the table 72. Okay. So 10 use neither that again is a joint idea 72 don't use Instagram. So there's no mention of Twitter, right? That should be like a marginal thing. It marginalizes the other thing and ignores it in life. So go put it on the correct. Margin the Instagram no over here. It's the total of all that  And in the 38 goes here. Now, you have to go figure out stuff in the table that I didn't give you luckily things add to the margin so you can go figure out 28 and then you can use that to add a cross and get 48. So we want the probability.  A randomly-chosen student will be on Instagram but not on Twitter.  Now on Instagram. Yes, and on Twitter knows this number that's a count to figure out the probability of 2/3 people were in this cookie in this survey and the only way to figure that out. It's this box right here in the lower, right? That is the total number of people which is why I'm working so hard to get around to that number.  So then you have your answer 28 / 120.  Okay, we continue.  Train your brain to work faster than it wants to go.  That's what this is all about. That's what these timings are for. Those are pictures where we are. You need to go get that 62 if you was one exactly one is a nice way of saying this is okay. This is okay, but it's not okay. If you do both this is one of the cleanest expressions in English talk about the exclusive or  okay, so you need to add those together because combined they make up the universe you care about 90 people are on exactly one of them.  that means  not both of them and not neither of them 3/4.  Okay, and you can keep going with the table and fill in the last thing if you want so that was all about losing disjoint this.  We have intersections that have stuff in them. The end was full of yummies. So now we need to lose Independence. So this is the harder thing to lose. This is when events have impacts on one another and change how you feel about that.  And the reason that we have this in life is because it really mimics what's going on. You're always in life taking an information and it updates are change how you believe in things. You may believe your friend has perfect loyalty to you, right but then something happens and not valuing your head changes you update it, right?  So information makes you reconsider so here to easy examples it will rain today in San Diego.  He is the event you see dark storm clouds if you just ask someone about Exile say 1 and 100.  Which is about how often it rains here, but if you tell them to be is a curd then suddenly the answer is dramatically different right? Maybe it's 50% Maybe it's 90% So knowledge about one event is changing how we feel about the other event.  So what starts is low moves to be much higher bunch of information now, we need to make notation for this and we don't have it yet. And it looks like the following you right PE of a given B with this little vertical line segment.  And this is the probability that a will occur.  If you absolutely know that event B has definitely occurred the thing to the right of the bar, you know, you're certain of  Answer this is how you notate a conditional probability.  And you have to memorize that the thing to the right of the bar is what we absolutely know is true. And the things of the left is what we're still wondering about in life and trying to make predictions about it. Just a convention. It could have gone the other way. So let's try some examples. One of these is just a normal probability. The other is a conditional probability and I want some of these are hand and tell me which one you think is bigger left or right and why?  Go ahead. Why is right side bigger?  Yes, this is why you study right? Cuz you secretly believe it takes whatever the probability of getting an a was and makes it bigger. So that's why the one on the right is bigger than the other one.  Go ahead.  Why is the left bigger?  Most players in the NFL are male.  Most if not all but most is still true.  So is the what is the probability on the right hand side?  What value does it exactly equal currently players in the NFL itself identifies female? Okay. Hopefully it will change one day rules.  rules for the NFL  to put in a ruler to take out  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I just know that probably right now is zero.  Okay. Now the probably in the left is still small number like to know how many people play in the NFL 5000 3000 currently / 350 million. So it's not very good with another one in San Diego and San Diego given this person behind a curtain you suddenly is female.  Which ones bigger?  Nope too much you.  There's no difference. Is there a simpler way in English to say that?  the numbers in question are  the sets are another way we using map.  symbol Maybe  now the reason of equals exactly because of what you said the events going on which are in the parentheses are independent of each other. Okay doesn't matter what gender the random person behind the curtain at self-identifies as it doesn't change the weather last time I checked.  Maybe know you said no thing in the universe all matters tied together.  Something I don't know whatever like I finally what independent events are going to be. It's based off what we just did.  Okay, if the probability of a sum number and the probability of a after you know, some information is still that same number then be has not influenced you whatsoever on how you feel about a and he stands apart from be knowledge about be is unimportant in relation to a this is one way to Define independent events and last class we went through this very complicated flow chart game to think about whether things were independent or not.  Okay, so you can see now based on this definition. What was I having you do? I was having to calculate P of a I was having you calculate P of a given you knew that be occurred, which we now have a notation for and I was saying are those the same or are they different and when they were the same that's when we said things were independent you games no information about a when you heard about the  Now if a is independent of b u have this expression right here and it turned out you can prove that be will be independent of a if this one doesn't influence that one in mathematics that one open phones this one.  Okay, so there's a helpful fact to remember.  The one cool thing about independent events is because it is you've actually been some of you have been thinking about this and dreaming about this your whole life believe it or not. So I think about independent events often in terms of social justice.  Okay. So here's two things. You can calculate the probability of a random person is female. This is like 51.5% if you go look at the data.  If you know someone works at Google my best friend works a Google. Did you just put a gender on them? Did they get more male or female something?  Okay, so some people won't like that when I just say I have a friend who works at Google you are not Imagining the gender on that person. Then probably that they are female has stayed the same if that happens. Independence, you would love gender and what do you get to get a job at Google or not to be independent of one another that's what social justice is driving for you seen the ones about the stats on pulling people over and it soon as you know, some of the race it totally changes the probability that they get pulled over if you just look at the data like it would be really nice if that didn't give you any information in life. We could fix it so that these events are independent any values for equal.  So if you are social justice person and you care about this, this is one way to help you think about this and to talk about it.  Okay. Now how do you say conditional probabilities in a contingency table? We seen the joint and you seen the marginal and now, you know the Third Kind of probability which is conditional. Where would it appear? Well, let me show you how it appears so you can say what the probability someone is a Twitter user.  So we need this missing number 82 and we were just / 120. That's not a conditional probability. Right? That is a probability that says I care about everyone in your study and I don't know anything about this person. We're going to pick out now we're going to do this question. What's the probability? Someone uses Twitter given that they absolutely must use Instagram.  And what school is in the table? You can see this probability by limiting your scope if you know someone's an Instagram user they don't live in the totality of the table anymore. They live in this one row at the top. There's somewhere in that row because that's the Instagram. Yes, bro.  And now your universe is not 120 people anymore now, it's 48.  So that will be the denominator of anything you do. And now you just say Okay. I want them to use Twitter. Well in this universe, there's 20 Twitter users.  But there's only 48 people because we've narrowed down our universe. So conditional probabilities in a contingency table involve winnowing away reducing your field of you to just a column or just a row or just maybe a couple rows.  And then asking that question within that universe.  Now you'll notice here. We got different answers right for these two probabilities.  When you get different values out of this kind of expression that shows that these events are dependent somehow they're connected. If they're independent we would have gotten the same number for both of these Instagram usage would tell us nothing about Twitter usage, but I did tell us something in this made-up example actually lowered.  That was a reason of my lower it if someone uses Instagram, why do you think they might be less likely to use Twitter?  You don't have to believe what you're going to say. I just need something reasonable.  Glad very back.  Beautiful Instagram people are Picture People for the most part. There's a visual elements of why the social media site exist Twitter.  That was a brilliant idea. Love it. Okay, so you could see how they might be dependent and in a strange way. Yeah.  And it but it just so happens that like what like the probabilities are different if the events are truly independent those two probably have to be the same. What's the definition of independence? So if you get the same number or independent, you're different numbers their dependent end of story.  Okay. So the question is like what is this? What is 68.3 and 68.2? Okay. So then this is super complicated and like usually in in life there very few things that are truly truly independent where these come out to be exactly equal almost everything in life. They're going to differ the real question is like how much do they differ?  You know if you can bring the female rated Google.  Within .0001 of the female rate in the US. You're probably happy.  Okay, so it's a very nice point and there's not a great answer to that. It just depends.  Okay. Now we've been working with counts. You don't have to fill a contingency table accounts. You can fill with percentages or probabilities if you want also everything's the same here. So here's a little table you ask people what they self-identify as gender and whether they fill in fall into a high medium or low Facebook usage. This is an ordinal variable. There's three bins and there's an order to them low is somehow less than medium is somehow essenhigh. I don't know exactly how those spacings work. But okay and we've also forced people into this male-female. This is a nominal data type. There's a finite number of bins and there's no order you can put a less than sign between male and female. Okay. This is off also like a terrible perpetuating binary example  But it helps with just doing this diagram for a little bit. So if you want low Facebook usage knowing that someone is a female, so I just wanted to show you again. Like how one would go about this if you know that they identify as female limit your Universe to batreaux only.  Okay, that's 55% of the people who were in the study that your new universe and then go pick out the low number from that by looking in the the low usage. So .05 and then just go divide those two. So 9.1% chance women apparently tend not to be low Facebook users.  based on these data  now if you want some formula to help you remember this, here's the form of the probability of a given B. And now that we've done it in a table. It makes sense. Okay, what happened when I was doing this probability. Well, I limited myself to the event. It was described by Bewitched or female. Okay, and I went and I looked up that number right there .55 that's a probability someone self-identified.  And then what did I do? I pick this number .05 will guess what? That's a joint probability. It lives inside the table and Joint probabilities are always and statements. You need one thing to be true and another thing in their meeting at the Joint soapy of a + b / pfb.  And that's how you find these kinds of probabilities.  Are you ready for some Kratom do we dare?  Be gentle.  Can you get 10 out of 10 questions right in a row?  Let's find out based on this table.  Please don't break internet 88 Dental.  Don't come into the room too fast.  What is the probability someone is male and a medium Facebook user use the image on the slides? Okay mail and medium Facebook.  Don't break internet. 27 stock.  I told them there's something weird about this room doesn't happen. Any other room on campus I said, is there anything weird about this room can help you? Don't support this issue?  There's no points for Socrative accepting your soul.  To your Anonymous. I have no idea who you are when it's here.  Okay, let's just hit. How'd you do one so if you see the word and it's a joint probability to be something in the table mail me and Facebook is right here .1 now. Usually you divide the number here by the whole table but divided by 1 is very boring. So you can just use that one number without dividing by one probability of mail.  How We Do 99% we only lost 1% okay, so this is a marginal probability right there's no mention of the other idea in the problem which is Facebook Eunice  So the answer should be on a margin when you go look for it.  Which number is not a joint probability?  I wonder if it's counting up slowly cuz of Internet stuff.  I don't imagine this problem takes this long was to see how we did. We lost a bunch of people .6 is apparently the right answer. It's right there on the margin. So the marginal probability all the other numbers are Central to the core of the table. So that's how you would decide that one.  If we keep losing 20% of people every time.  No one's going to get any of these. All right.  Except whether you get them right or wrong depends is a dependent events get the first one right? Probably get the second one, right? Anyhow mail or low Facebook user mail or low Facebook and start losing people.  But see how that went.  Oh.  Look at that be people of be now. You probably saw the answer when you did this. And so now you understand why you got this wrong.  Option one you're going to use the or rule.  Take both marginal probabilities and subtract the joint.  Option to you're just looking for maleness and low Facebook. So here's some mail this here's to maleness. Here's some illness.  It's a solo Facebook about I don't care now low face. So now just go grab this .05 2.05 at the intersection of the two.  female given medium Facebook Eunice  Someone's like someone behind the curtain screams out and I like yeah, I'm a medium Facebook user.  What's the probability they self identify as female?  Are we go 75% will take it medium Facebooking is so limit yourself to this column right here. Your universe is .3 big that's it. And now go pick up the female's Point 2/3. So that's where you get the answer Point 2 / 0.3.  medium Facebook Enos given female self-identification  Everyone's got this now. Basically, let me yourself to a row and then look at it for two events A&B. We must have P of a given b equals b a bigger than a  Now when I hit the reveal button here.  You should be looking at what percent be on 50 get this right?  random guessing gives 50% correctness  It's like I'm the last one that should have been above 25% is what you cared about in life.  Okay, 35% above random guessing. Basically, we just did two problems that prove. These are unequal. Right the last two problems. We got different answers. Maybe you didn't realize that's why I was doing them, but now you do.  male given not low Facebook user  Tricky Tricky  70 out of 200 not enough.  people still thinking  if you're bored, here's a question to think about if you were me.  And you're watching this climb. Where would you?  Hit the button and reveal the results.  No matter what you do. You're leaving people out.  Okay, the most complicated answer has to be the right one, right?  Is Meta Meta thinking right is actually thinking okay. So if they are not low Facebook user then they are in one of these two columns, and now your Universe has nine bigness to it.  And now you can go pick out the males in it point three and one and add those together.  So that's how you get .3 + 2.1 over the sum.  Just got interesting didn't it?  Now I'll show you what the answer key says.  Now you read this year, right?  Identify as female, they won't identify as male assuming gender binaries and assuming that your categorization tool does not allow dual categorization.  I'm on the PHD dissertation committee for student who's looking at lgbtq issues in stem and he did a study with 20,000 people in calculus classes and it was a little question self identify your sexual orientation.  And some people would choose things like asexual and heterosexual.  straight and gay  queer and heterosexual and questioning  So just because you put a bunch of beans in front of people doesn't mean people are going to identify with one of them. Now this stupid little data set. I put in front of you. Okay, since I drew a line between male and female  clearly no one shows both.  But this is super complicated and now he's trying to do analysis of like how the lgbtq students feel about this and he's like, what do I do if they chose straight and queer and I'm like, I don't know.  Let's go try to talk to some people and see why they chose that this is super complicated. Anyhow, so you see how is Dad questions or just so like perpetuating all this terrible nonsense, so don't be some later in this class. They don't perpetuate silly nonsense and I don't even know what the truth is to be honest. I think gender sexuality is so complicated and I try to think about this and it's really hard for me. So you take a lot of queer Theory class in so you still don't really know what's going on with people cuz it's so confusing.  I don't know if it's the right models yet to think about this stuff. Anyhow, let's go in a number 10 female not medium Facebook.  Are you on the chart? Sorry?  No just to do without.  That's why it's the hardest question.  We have four minutes. Perfect timing how we doing here only half keep going.  You should use the last two or three minutes of every class at the most important minutes.  Get more out of your school. How'd you do people got this idea. Now, you see how it slowly grew everytime we did one.  And finally for the last question, please try to be honest about this.  It will be very helpful for the class understand how they did relative to what's out there.  Now, when do you hit the button here?  trickier  a third of people are probability masterminds already. Now, let's go back in our last three minutes. We have three minutes. We will use them.  Let's go back to English.  I want to show you what a hot mess it is again. So what we're going to do write an expression for the given probability decide if you were asked or were asked to find a joint marginal or conditional  Seems pretty easy, right? So what's the setup we have a dataset where we have three thousand nine hundred emails basically an H1 we decided it was spam filter think it was spam one would be yes, I think your spam in life. And the other thing is, how big is the biggest number I see in this email.  And they have big small and no things appeared. So these are both categorical variables. So make sense to use a contingency table. That's when you use categorical variables. It was me making right here the contingency table. It doesn't have the margins on it. Okay, and you can see how the 3900 emails got divided out. So I'll do the first one what percent of messages are spam with no numbers.  This is incredibly hard for English and native English speakers because English is such a mess. So here's how I can help you first thing figure out what the universe is that you're living in. Have you been conditioned down to just look at a small subset of things or is everything fair game. So here all messages are fair game.  And what do you care about once you decided all messages are fair game. You want spam with no numbers we use the word with to mean and  Hey, so there's an encoding to do in your head. So this is probably spam and no number and you can see if the joint probability cuz it has the word and in it. This is how you do these to find the universe if the universe is everything. There's no conditioning bar. If it's a small subset that you only care about it goes to the right of the conditioning bar to go probability gosh.  It's Friday 1:49.  Okay, so someone tell me what the universe is.  And then once you've done that tell me the probability we're looking for and use words like I did hear.  Who wants to go?  Glad what's universe.  Damn, which is going to be okay, I don't care about numbers to say the universe is Spam messages. What are we looking for within that universe?  This is all I want for you to do right here knows things. The numbers can come after but the identification is the hard thing. So there's some more in here if you want to work on that skill. Have a nice weekend.  Can you eat sandiego.edu? "
