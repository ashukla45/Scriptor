    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Welcome back.  simmer down  I wanted to make sure you knew about a few things if you're not observant.  First of all, if you look at the calendar, we have an exam a week from Wednesday. We are here on the 8th. And here we are in the 17th.  Next thing if you go to Triton Ed, you will find it helpful folder here called exam 1 materials. There's an info sheet that tells you what's on the exam.  How long it is how much accounts and all the Myriad questions that people typically ask me which are on the sheet and I've accumulated the answers to all of these. So now I could do questions about exams.  Okay, great. Also, you will find old exams here if you're curious.  The length and so on. These are all exams that I wrote so they will have the same flavor.  And this will hopefully give you some additional practice if you're looking for additional practice.  That seems to help people.  also if you're going to trade Ned  You'll notice that the homework assignments that the solutions have started to appear here.  Disappear roughly twenty-four hours after it's due. Sometimes it's even faster.  And will hopefully give you a look into maybe other ways to solve problems. Sometimes include multiple Solutions.  The Tas and I brainstorm all the different possible ways. We can think to do things and those to appear here. So he don't know how to do something. You can go take a look almost as soon as you turned it in within a day while still fresh in your mind, which will be helpful for people. You don't have to wait a week to figure out how something is done.  I don't think I noticed is that the homework tracks very closely with where we are in class. Sometimes we do some material and the next day is when the homework is due for that material is very tightly controlled. So if you start to work ahead you'll be like, I don't know what's going on and there were four people in my office today that had that issue. So if you really like working ahead you can look ahead at the sides are 24 hours in advance. I get you another day.  Or you can read the textbook which I see things to. So anyhow, I like to keep things very tightly controlled through learning about things and then working on them immediately and learning those and getting them under your belt. It's time to go on now a little more chapter 2 we dig a Little Deeper.  And I wanted to organize all the fancy rules, you know.  And a two different kinds the first if you have any two events, you seen how to find the probability of a or statement back when they were just joints. We just added the probabilities together, right?  And then we talked about losing destroying this the other day and we had this more complicated will be of A + B + b - B of A + B.  someone pointed out after class  do we really need two rules?  And there's no you really only need one rule because you'll notice if the events are disjoint this last term P A and B. There's no intersection. So that probability zero so the fancy rule collapses down to the trivial roll.  That's kind of nice. You would hope that would happen sort of philosophically in life.  Now we have PVA and be at the other common thing you do all the time and we first went in that that was just a product of the two probabilities. If the events were independent. What are we going to do if they're dependent which happens a lot of time in life? So we need to come up with the rule to deal with this situation.  And the cool thing is you have already come up with such a rule. We just didn't write it and really form.  So here's what it looks like if you actually went and tried the demonstration at the end of the last slides or if you just paid attention as we were going through all those slides we came up with this rule of how to find the conditional probability. Okay, you narrow your universe and just the world of be that's in the denominator and then we looked at a joint probability table.  NFPA NP and that was our way of finding conditional probabilities. Well, if you just rearrange that you have a rule for p of A and B in the event that there's dependent events going on. It turns out if you want both A and B to happen.  Here's a logic writing key of B is like Imagining the B occurs.  And in Reading PA of a given B has a occur after bee has shown up and now they're both are right. So that's how I think about this rule forever. One two things to occur. I make one show up and then I make the other one show up after I know the first one to shown up you should have condition.  Hey after be and then you make be happen by reading probability of B. So that fills in our missing spot here.  And as we did in the top of those slides you would really hope that the complicated rule would collapse to the simple rule when you have the extra conditions that bread the simple rule.  And right here you look if a and b are independent this big complicated conditional probability. It's just key of A.  So you can peel a x p b.  If you want to be amazing in life, this is something you always do.  Whenever you wanted something complicated you immediately say what's the simplest possible case that I could ever understand and you see if it collapses down to something you already know?  Even the 2D version of the Pythagorean theorem write a squared plus b squared equals c squared. Well when you learned 3D version you get a squared plus b squared plus b squared equals c squared.  And you think will be the easiest possible three-dimensional box. I could ever create it would be the flat box.  And as measuring the diagonal across and you're just creating the hypotenuse of the triangle, so anyhow, that's another example of collapsing away.  merciful zero so a squared plus b squared equals c squared  So how does all this look different when you're actually doing problems? So let's do a little problem with bags and balls leaves red and green.  Guess I'm feeling in a Christmas mood or was when I wrote this.  So here we go to Red three green other reason you always say these kind of problems can now it's probably a cliche. If you've done enough of these balls in urns are balls in bags. It's because it makes a nice little setup When You Reach things in you have no idea what's going to grab it's like all random, right? And it's also an understanding setting that everyone can understand in case I'm not choosing something here that like only favors the people born in the USA or in Texas or whatever. So that's one reason I get to make these choices when you're designing problems and putting them on things like every time she make her some and it helps others and I should make decisions that are devoid of any kind of contacts, which is hard to do when you doing statistics.  So here we go to bed. Angry you're going to reach in and grab some balls. Right? First time. We do this we're going to go to balls with replacement.  Okay, so you reach and grab a ball look at it or down its color in a piece of paper put the ball back shuffle them up reach and grab a new ball. Look at its color cord it then put it down. What is the probability both balls are red. So this is a probability term. That means basically anytime you do something you return this the system to its natural state. So I took a ball out but I put it back in and shuffle them every time I try to choose a ball and always looks the same and always has five balls to read dream to hear my events A&B ones about the first ball you pull out to being red and the others about this being the second ball being red, and I'd really like for both of them to happen.  The cool thing is when you do stuff with replacement since the system is always returned to its original state. A&B will have no effect on one another if you pull a red ball out first grade have a prize but then you put the ball back and your chances of pulling out the red ball or just like they were when you started the experiment and this makes problems quite easy actually. So since the events are independent and can't influence one another when you want to know the and you just multiply the two and you get lots of terms like 2/5 * 2/5  I was gentle wasn't it.  That's as easy as it gets with replacement. Now, we're going to do the harder case without replacement. So you pull the ball out your record its color you don't put it in.  Uh-oh if you were balls.  And it gets really messy.  Because now A & B are dependent. Can you tell me why they are dependent?  Go ahead.  when you select a ball the first time it changes things the second time you said how so  The denominator is going to get changed before. So I agree. It's not like the previous problem.  Where the denominator always 5 but that doesn't mean the events are dependent just means there's a new denominator.  You want to add to her thoughts?  It depends what color of ball you pick up first. If I pick up the red ball first when I go to draw the second ball the denominators for what's the numerator how many red balls are left?  Uno  If the first ball turns out not to be red when I go to draw the second ball the denominators for what's the numerator?  To cut both the red balls are still sitting in there. So the numerator is very hard to figure out what it wants to be in life. It depends on what happened in the first draw.  Oh, my goodness actions have consequences.  Apparently is what's going on here.  So if a occurs be suddenly becomes less likely to occur to do this problem. We need to use our fancy or rule about A and B.  So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say let's make a occur. That is what imagine a red ball get pulled out. And then what we're going to do is try to go get a red ball for the second one given that we know we've already pulled out one red ball if we're going to create the event A and B, then we need a to occur and we need to be to occur after a has occurred and when you're doing this conditioning you can do it. Anyway you want okay, so I decided to make a happen and then let be happen. After that. You could have said P of p x p of a given B, but then it gets very confusing.  Because a is supposed to be the first ball that comes out. So how you going to think about the first ball?  Being something when you know, the second ball was red, but I don't even know what that means. So anyway to make the events happen in a natural order. Yeah.  with and without replacement of the names for these  nothing fancier. Okay. So let's go put some numbers. So I'm going to go to Fitz there five balls to start and if you want to read one, you got to grab one of the two red ones then on the second turn their four balls left and if a has occurred you took out a ball, so there's only one remaining so that's why this is 1/4.  And now we get the answer 1/10.  Now you can do this to figure out all the possible results. It might happen. Then I'll just have to look at two red balls and I'll show you using a tree diagram.  How these different probabilities help lay out how the dependence is visualized. So here are balls Merry Christmas. Let's pull on it can either be red or green? So this first bridge and our tree diagram is about the first event and what happens on it.  Now you can write probabilities over these tree diagrams and you'll notice this is just about the first event. There's no mention of the second event going on yet. So this actually marginal probability. It discusses one of the things and does in completely ignores the other okay. Now these numbers have to add up to one because something has to happen in life and you draw. Okay. So if that's two fits its complement will be 3/5 and if there's only two options coming off here, you can always just put the event and its complement.  If however say on a homework problem you talk about gender binaries.  Now it's not simply a and a compliment anymore. Now, there's like the actual names to these three different things, but they're still marginals cuz they're ignoring what's going to come after the second event.  Okay. Now when you draw the next level the tree it's about the other thing you care about here's a second ball and you're going to get you can just copy and paste whatever this expression is in the top Branch down to the other one.  And now the numbers you can't just copy and paste.  Because there's some dependency going on. So if the first will happen to be red you can see the new State of Affairs and if it were green you would get a different state of affairs and that didn't affect the probabilities that when you play the probability over this next little segment. These are conditional probabilities.  Maybe never realized it's about tree before but if you're talking about this Branch, guess what you've already gone down that pathway. It is one hundred percent guarantee that you're on that path.  Okay, so this is always a conditional probability and if it's a binary choices have to add up to one obviously and over here. There's two Reds out of the four to get 2/4.  And its complement also 2/4 amazing.  Now if you go all the way from the beginning of the tree out to the end, you will have gone to balls and so you can look at the two balls you have in front of you and neither the different possibilities. Now, sometimes these possibilities will overlap. If you don't care about the particular ball number. Okay. So for example, this one came out red then green this one right here came out green then red. You probably don't care and this problem about the order of those two. It's not like you wrote the number on the ball as you pulled it out and a red one is different than a red to sell the same to you in case of these can overlapping collapse down if you need them to be now what's going on here at the end is actually an and statement to Joint probability.  And if you want to know I want to know if I can into red balls. All I have to do is go down that pathway and then go on that one and you can just multiply through the tree.  Okay, we already seen P A and B and we got the answer 1/10, right?  So you believe me when we multiply them and that's also the P of A and B formula right there and you can go do this for every one of the pads.  And then if there's a situation where you don't care about the order they came out and they sort of collapse and one red one green is same as one green one red.  Then you can start adding those together in case I added these two cases right here 620 Datsun 620. It's good me that 12/20 things. You probably don't care.  Set a time you can do all of them important thing is to remember in a tree diagram where all the different three kinds of probability show up. So if you have a problem that gives you lots of conditional probability the tree is incredibly Natural Choice a model that  Where is the Venn diagram with suck it doesn't do conditional probability naturally?  Okay, so you're a general thing whenever you have to venture excited about in life. You can choose one of them and make that the first break point and you're going to probabilities that are marginal. The second event will be Xerox.  For each branch that you had in the original and you can go put the probabilities on that and they are conditional.  Okay, so here are the four different things going to happen. So in this pathway we started by going down the not a so that's definitely given and then we are heading toward the not be so that's why it's not be given not a you can write then. If you want you can write the complement symbol.  Hey, there is a proliferation of symbols around an odd idea because it's so important.  Now that's just the tree if she could have blast through it and explore the different possibilities that could happen. That's where you get all the joint events. Okay. This one right here is a not because we went down there and then we go and if you want to know the probability of that happening you just multiply the probabilities that happened along the way and that will give you the probability of A and B complement.  and again, you can see if it like in the previous example things collapsed but here and not be may be different than not a and b  a visual difference intentionally in the slide  marginals conditionals joints  enough for me. I'm for you.  time for you  Let's go to Socrative.  If you don't know much about cards, it's time for you to learn about cards for some people. They've been doing this their whole life a standard deck of 52 cards has half black half red.  There are four different suits based on the picture that appears in the card from a club a spade a heart and a diamond. You will definitely be familiar with some of those symbols from everyday life. The cards go from a up to 10 and then you start getting pretty pictures Jack Queen and club or king. Sorry Jack queen and king come there after so he's at the 52 cards to see how you doing. My Progressive difficulty question.  Number one. What's the probability of drawing a face card?  It may surprise you that usually about 20% of the class has never done cards.  I know that's talking to you is true.  That's why I had to start showing the picture and talking about them.  And lots of other countries don't use this American Centric deck. There's all sorts of other decks of cards out there.  How to do probability a face card 92% Okay all the people that shows D. Sorry the ace is not a face card. You're probably all including the ace doesn't look like a face to me so that the definition of thing there you go. So that's probably most of people that just haven't done a lot of cards drawing a black card or a queen. Let's see if you can use all of our fancy rules.  If you want to make it harder on yourself don't look at the picture and get in your head.  Then you have to occupy more of your mental bandwidth with Imagining the deck of cards in its layout.  where not to 2/3 jet  if this is Progressive difficulty.  The percent to get this correct should be lower if I've done this perfectly.  are you people that shows a  you can probably see that you were just using the Orville Wright and just adding P A + p a v but unfortunately, these aren't just joint.  They have an overlap.  Cody to Black Queen's right? Here are the overlap. So anyhow, if you want to do this one way, it's just to take all these cards are here. It is 26 of those and then out on these two queens that haven't been counted yet. That's one way to do it or you can see in the solution to your use the fancy rule that adds it and then subtracts away the overlap to get to 28.  Uh, oh, we're already at 70% We're going to keep going down.  You draw two cards without replacement.  What is the probability of getting two black cards?  Oh not Progressive difficulty.  I have to reorder this now.  Okay.  Hopefully you did this little thing in your head worried about getting the first card Black and then worried about getting the second. Once you knew the first was already black.  events draw King and draw a black card or just joint  I can tell by the rate. This is counting up that it's too easy to remove that.  Drawing the king of drawing a black card or independent.  Well, that went downhill fast.  There is no fast way to play this game. You just have to do it find the probability of drawing a king 113.  Assume the card you've drawn is black.  Figure out the probability. It's black. It's a king once it's black. So you have 26 cards and only two of them were Kings on 13th.  Same answer right? You get the same result. That's what independence's you simply have to sit there and think you can use your stole cuz you saw what happened when you lose your soul, right?  It's counterintuitive.  Some people went the other way.  And first I thought about drawing a black card and they said okay, let's say he's holding a king. What's the probability of a black king and they said there's only four Kings and half of them are black so they can got 1/2.  So it's interesting how your intuition will destroy you you could have randomly guest and got an 50% correct?  You draw two cards without replacement probability you end up doing both the red and the black.  crazy for you  There's two thirds.  There we go. People chose to complicated looking thing, right?  Okay. See you saw me here. Just saying well, if the first cards red make the second card Black if the first card Black make the second card red.  Those are different things. They lead to a outcome that you don't care. They're the same outcome basically, but they're created in different ways. You have to conclude both.  If you simplify the answer from the last problem you get 26 / 51.  knowing this  describe a simple way to immediately see that the answer should have been 26 / 51.  That is if you know what the answer is, can you come up with a super clever way?  ticket to the answer  you don't remember the last question.  a red and black  that was the goal.  Is it fun texting me?  what it feels like  I get a lot of texts.  Yeah, and you're also texting the whole class. You're right cuz it shows up.  Here we go. Let's see what we got so far.  What are you doing?  I'm impressed by that.  How many people know what that's talking about? You guys should look up tdq. If you don't know that is.  Your first card draw does not matter. The only thing you need is that the second card is of the opposing color?  Draw a card. What's the probability of drawing a card?  One not done it.  Look at it.  If a color right  How many cars did the other color left?  All of them 26 and it's 51 cards left in the deck.  So this is a very weird way of conditioning condition on like the first one red or not. You can just say draw a card. That's a 100% action. It's a very strange thing to condition on.  Let's see what the very first person wrote.  That was good.  Okay, and I'm sure all the trolls stuff is at the top.  That's one reason. I love probability. There's these clever ways of thinking about things that the first moment you see them. You're like, oh my goodness love this way of thinking super clever and then you become clever and then you can share that cleverness and then you seem clever.  You should choose better ringtone.  Actually, I kind of like that.  Yeah, that's kind of cool. Anyhow.  Any board game fans in the room?  Yeah, you play Euro games of all the complicated rule sets and stuff were lots of dice and spend lots of spinners. So here's a problem based off complicated Euro board games free to think about  Play the board game. You need to kill an enemy 3 Health points.  Well, usually the way you figure out how much damage you do to your opponent to some incredibly complicated mechanic.  Because that's what makes these games fun, right? Okay. So here we go. You spend this dial it can either come up a or b and it's more likely to come out to pee then it just be 2/3 1/3 know if you got lucky and we'll be in spun the a then you get a four-sided die label interfor and if you got lucky and got to be you roll a six-sided die.  Now one of these Luxe is better than the other.  You probably want to be rolling the six-sided die because it has lots of big numbers on it and big numbers are how much damage you do to your opponent?  What is the probability of your enemy dies when it is your turn to attack?  Now this is a perfect problem for a tree because we actually have conditional probabilities.  Okay, there's there's two things going on. There's an event that then dictates different situations. We should feel very tree for you.  So typically when your conditioning here in building your tree, whatever happens first you put first in the tree cuz it's the natural way to think about it. So you roll this is so you spin the spinner and it's either going to force you into using dye or Dye be based on whether the spinner comes up a or b. Okay, so you could have used the spinner language here, or you can just jump right and tell me what day you're going to use and you should go put those numbers on there and make sure they had to one that's her metacognitive Pro tip for the day.  I assume silly that I could say that right. Lots of people their numbers don't have to 1. Okay, then what happens next you roll this thing?  And now you have to say what do I actually care about when I'm rolling this thing? Well, you probably just care about whether the opponent is going to be killed or not. Sometimes the problem will tell you what you should care about him like enemy dies.  So that is forming your second important thing. So on the four sided die, you would love to see your 3 or higher and the same thing is true on the six-sided die.  Sounds good to me. Right and if you didn't want to put these things here you could have used an event like and if he dies and if he doesn't die, I wanted to avoid the word died in a problem that has Dice and that has negative connotation.  One thing another metacognitive thing to pay attention to when you go to the numbers on the next level deep.  It would be really nice if those numbers look different as you look from one branch to another.  Because if you really have some dependent things going on here.  Then you should see different numbers. Cdib just has four of its six sides that are helpful. It's killing the enemy where Diane last to the three in the four.  If you if you get the same numbers on each of these branches like to force their looks like to force their and similarly the compliments with the same, then you don't have dependent events. You have independent events. Then you probably should be using a tree to be doing the problem. You're using the wrong tool for what's going on.  Now all we care about in this problem is getting toward that 3 or higher so multiply your way through the tree as you take the journey along the branches and figure out how you get to three or higher 2/3 times 2/4, or you could do one-third times for 6. So you have to claim your chance of getting the Good Die but once you have it, it does a very good job of killing the enemy.  When you're designing board games for a living, these are the kinds of calculations you end up doing or you run a simulation in R to help you figure out if it's super complicated and you just adjust the rule said so everything comes out probably Stickley where you want it. So anyhow, you're going to add those two together because they are both.  Exciting things that lead to what we want in life. They do it in different ways.  may result in the same outcome, but  you would care for this or you would care for that and these are disjoint. There's no way to go down two pads at the same time.  So I'm just using the simple or rule to add those together.  I can't believe I wasted all this time getting common denominators. This is silly cuz you're going to write all these silly things which you know how to do they know how to do.  Okay, so there's an example of a tree being used very effectively on a board game problem. Now, it's time for the most important theorem about conditional probabilities.  This is named after Sir Thomas Bayes. He was a reverend and Mike 1600s and you came up with this clever idea. So he notice you can ride TV A&B and condition it out. Like we've been doing make be happen and then once these happen to make a happened.  Elizabeth II couldn't we do things the other way.  Or could we just switch the roles of A and B & F Formula if you want.  And now you're the probability of A and B is well here you making a happen and then you're making be happy same thing. You couldn't be at the end and he said what if we set those equal to each other but anything interesting on kase O P A and B is the same with B in BNA. So then you set the messy sides equal to each other.  And we're working toward what's known as Bayes theorem.  now here's the first incarnation of it. A given b e x p v equals to be given a  turns out this not the most useful for Malaysian.  What days was smart about is getting one of these conditional probabilities all by itself? So here's P of a given b equals. He'd be given a x p of a / pfp.  And when you first see this year like why would I ever care about this big hot mess?  And this was the inside bass hat.  on the left your conditioning where be is known and he's trying to think about a  but that might be an unnatural ordering of things. You may not actually have information about that. And so with the right hand side is doing its switching the ordering so now is the known thing and you're thinking about be here as a thing that would happen based on a such a cool formula and then it can reverse the order around the conditioning bar.  And sometimes you desperately need to do that in life.  hats various the inside of FaZe  Now that's not always the way they staring shows up in textbooks.  Sometimes people will take this denominator and write it in a more complicated way. Sometimes you don't know about TV.  So they write with Cody Advanced Bayes theorem. So everything here is exactly the same except that P of B has been written in a way more complicated way.  And let me help you understand how you get to that.  Pnb is trying to act like the occurs and you could say well how could be occur in life?  The only two ways to get B.  One is to get a first and then be follows and you got me.  The other is for a not to occur and then 4B to happen after a has not occurred.  Those are the only ways to get be in life.  There's this other event a that either occurs in a needs to be or doesn't occur and Beach to be.  They might say why what do you ever make a big hot mess with my beautiful days formula and the truth. Is that often? There's a marginal probability that you don't know what a problem until what I'm doing is taking the marginal probability and converting it over to other things that you tend to sometimes have and it feels awkward. But as soon as we start doing some examples to see that it's very weird to have this denominator and in natural settings you tend to have all four of these pieces and not TFE which is unbelievable when you first do it  So let's try a little baby version of Base here.  183 30% of students got an A on midterm 1  40% of students studied a long time or there's some definition you have of a long time.  It was probably you got an A given that you studied a long time to 70%  What is the probability that you studied a long time? If you got an A when you first read this which will notice in your mind or out loud as you tend to say almost the same phraseology, but you do it twice in one time. It's reversed.  Here I said.  The probability that an egg and when you studied a long time and then I asked about the probability study a long time giving you got an A and you can feel the reversal of The Ordering of what's being what's going on here. And this is a sign when you feel like your soul that you should use Bayes. So we need to start with some events. I'll be kind and to find them for you. I chose the Natural Things based on what was going on in the problem Azor on that pretty little exam in s is you study time.  Now one of the hardest things when you put these big blocks of text in front of people is decoding them from the word Universe into the mathematical notation universe.  You need to practice this. So here we go. I'm going to underline some pretty things and colors.  I hope that these colors are not colors that you're color-blind to. Otherwise, we'll have a problem. It's  11% of the world has colored lines, so  It turns out there was no choice. I can make that helps everybody. It's very frustrating.  When you take an information visualization class, you study color patterns and maybe in CS a lot of your CS people you might do this to when you do web design you have to study color blind helpful color palettes to use on your website, but don't you know, cause all the colors to look the same to 10% of the population or whatever it is. So that's why you design people. Anyhow, someone go first tell me how to turn the blue thing into a bunch of simple math notation.  Someone be daring and raise your hand.  Go ahead.  Houston, please.  PVA is .3 I love you already using the decimals to you don't need that percentage nonsense anymore. Who wants to do red. Go ahead.  PMS is equal to point for you might want to change is equal to 2 equals. It's one word instead of three condensed down the language hunch it okay. Now it starts getting hard when we do green.  someone new  go ahead.  P of a given s equals .7, there you go now this gets tricky you got to make sure you get this right so you need to look for words that are suggesting what is given absolutely suppose.  He probably got an A given that you studied. That's very gentle when I use the word of given the strongest word. I can use. Okay, there's other words you can things like if I know that Bob ate a cow.  What is the probability he liked it? Okay, so here's to finding the thing that you know is given and even though the person appears first in the sentence. It goes to the right side of the bar. You can't use the placement in the English sentence to decide whether the given or not and then finally you can do our last one because we didn't get to calling you.  So you can do yellow.  Miracle you even chose  the symbol I would use for our unknown. There you go.  Now as soon as you do all this the problem just falls out. Okay, I simply use a base theorem. We care about us giving a I don't know anything about that. But if I could switch the order it's super helpful because guess what I know and give an S. It's right here .7 so I can use the simple base. I don't need to go super complicated here because we just happen to be lucky and have the denominator and problems so you don't have to move to Advanced and I plug in all the numbers and get some big mess.  Now I want to show you one where the baby version of face doesn't help you very much and you have to move to the advanced and it looks like a real world problem. And this is always really fun the first time you see this.  It's sort of a shocking problem. So here we go. Some of you might go into medical things and testing and this is a great example where Bae shows up in real life.  So doctors want to study the effectiveness of some HIV test guy.  That one thing you often do well testing on people, you know have HIV they've been diagnosed in the past and see it in their bloodstream Etc.  So 99.9% of the time you're beautiful test when used on people that have it says guess what they have it.  When you test it on people known to not have it. That's what it does a pretty good job, right 99% of the time. It says you ain't got it, but you have to realize that sometimes tests mess up.  You can have something in your bloodstream test won't find it. You could not have something in your bloodstream that says guess what you got it.  Cancer tests are fallible suppose someone from San Diego hears our HIV rate in San Diego. It slow as you might expect of a sort of developed Nation test positive. What is the probability that person actually has HIV?  You can imagine the scenario for yourself. You wouldn't. I be test it says positive.  Does it mean you have it test could be wrong right? So what's the probability you actually have it in your bloodstream. So I like to think what's in your bloodstream. And what's on little pest spits out on a piece of paper does the two ways I think about this to really keep them separate in my head. So first thing we need to find some events.  Okay, so I chose these four events.  And I did this intentionally so you feel frustrated with how much you have to write in this moment.  Yes.  Exactly. That's the feeling. I want you to have in this moment.  The negative sign it's just the complement of the positive side. I don't need a whole new sentence to Define it but I'm going to do it. So you feel the frustration.  50% of people to come to my office or the last week will define an event and then we'll Define another letter for the compliment waste of time. Stop doing that use the complement notation to your advantage.  So let's feel it out.  Does it feel frustrating to you already? That's good your personal use as compliments already?  Okay, so I gave you these events. We had a meta discussion to buy you time to write.  Now, let's go to the colors again. You have my notation you can use it.  Who wants to start with blue?  Do people really know those other people can do all this decoding?  right  94.99  The probability of plus given yes equals .999 you got the order, right? How did you decide what was given what was the word you used?  People never known to have so there's the English phrase this time around. The word given. So you just pick that up. Are you native English speaker?  Okay even got helped.  I don't know something something other department. Not off. Okay?  red  This is how you get good. You slow yourself down and write these things out.  No one wants to help us. Go ahead.  negative given no equals 0.99  Okay looks good to me going on.  We're 3 minutes. Clark is totally off. You didn't look at that. Okay, I'll do the last one cuz Running Out of Time T of yes. This one just mentions the HIV rate stuff in your bloodstream and has nothing to do with testing does a marginal probability.  So you'll notice this is a lot of Heroes when you convert that weird percentage, you have to move the decimal point and make lots of zeros, right? And this problem cares about. Yes given plus that's where we're looking for.  Okay. So here are those Stacks just written again that if you use simple base like we did in the previous problem. Here's what you're going to write I care about you asking and plus I don't know it so transition over to plus giving yes.  And now what you're going to find out if the denominator is not known.  This is the probability. The test says  Positive and it's a brand new test. So we don't know that. Okay. So here's where you would maybe move over to Advanced base. Now. It seems like it's going to be a disaster to move in that direction because it creates four terms instead of one. But the cool thing is you actually can find all of those terms believe it or not.  So let's look through them here. You can see the numbers I put in let's just think about the denominator plus giving yes. Okay. We had that number probably. Yes. We've got that also.  What's given? No, so does it look like we have that in our list, but guess what? It's related to - giving no because it's compliments and if you were using complement notation, you would feel it even more.  Okay, so 1-49. I really know don't have it. Guess what? It's the compliment of yes or 1 - vs.  And then you just talk at all in and you get 1.7.  No one was shocked by our result.  You only have a 1.7% chance of actually having HIV when the test comes back positive.  How is that possible?  You want to know how that's possible?  There is a great mismatch 9.9 % accuracy and 99% accuracy on the negative side, right the promise you're looking at something that is so incredibly rare in San Diego that there's a mismatch between how precise it is and how low the probability of seeing this thing.  This is something you have to learn about testing. You got to stop though.  See you guys later. "
