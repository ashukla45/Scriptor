So I said you need to have at least one standard deviation above the required 10 arrows standard deviation of what  okay, so it could be the standard deviation of what happens when you break one barrel, which you can go figure out using the information above but that's not what I intend.  Okay, so finding the variance and the standard deviation of breaking one barrel is not the intention for be it's to say let's break a certain number of barrels call that n.  When you break those in barrels you total together all your arrows. That's a new random variable. Some days. We'll get lucky and you get big valleys for it. Sometimes you get low values, but that new random variable which is the sum of all of them has its own expected value and it has its own standard deviation and standard deviation that you're worried about and you need to set up account for an iPad your answer by how much the total will they not the bearings going on in one barrel?  And if you breath of the wild people out there, I just completed my 100%  all 900 korok seeds  Some of you will know how painful collecting 900 korok seeds was.  I got the first 650 with no help from anything and then  Only then did I use the internet to help with some of the ridiculous ones?  Okay, we are on the chapter 3 out of chapter 2.  So what's happened? So far is this last class? I had the super contrive game and you like when will this ever happen? I don't care about this and we went and built a probability model or table for it mean I should do things that could happen those of the values of the random variable and How likely they were to come up. Those were the probabilities.  And from that table we could do all sorts of things. You could find the expected value what's going to happen on average? If you do this millions of millions of times or the variance and standard deviation how spread out are the kinds of values that are you are experiencing I should do it the trouble with this is this was super contrived and what you really want in life is to focus on the things that actually occur the naturally occurring questions. So we're going to do is figure out some of those common questions that always show up figure out what the probability tables are for those  And then along that Journey we will then be able to go find probabilities expected values. And so then you just fit life to those existing models now not all of life fit for that. But hey, if 85% of life can be put in pretty little boxes then put them in there.  But other people deal with those boxes and then you get to deal with the 15% of life is complicated.  So the groundwork we got to start with the simplest possible situation in life.  So this is a random process that has binary and results in one of two possible outcomes.  And every time you do it it has no memory of what happened in the previous one all the trials of this are independent. This is as nice as it can possibly get is simplified so you can see a coin flips here. These are nice processes with two possible outcomes. Now some things don't have two possible outcomes, but you can think of them in binary terms like the dice roll being even or odd one way to think about it. There's other ways to Binary turn it binary. Gene mutated emails being spam or not stand soccer games win or not when I guess not win with a tie and loss.  So, there you go.  Now this is called a Bernoulli trial named after the person who first sort of built this Theory you probably seen the name for newly all over the place in math physics. And so on one of those Bernoulli brothers or whatever.  And one way to sort of quickly, right what's going on is to say the two events. I'm going to call success and failure and success doesn't mean something good necessarily just mean something that you were focused on and you might care about and be looking for for example.  And you can assign a probability to getting that success has one and zero you don't need any words anymore.  Okay. Now these things have to add up to 1. So the probability of the failure idea is just 1 - p and people tend to write you to just simplify the notation cuz otherwise it's exhausting writing 1 - POF place. So we will do that. I know it doesn't seem like it's exhausting. How could it be exhausting to write 1 -  but it is  So let's start in so crowded and see if we can break the internet and think about some Bernoulli stuff.  No one's in the room. That's not good.  Hello.  internet's down  hit some buttons and see what will happen.  Oh, yeah, you got to think I forgot. Sorry.  Portland Timbers play some soccer fans in the room  Yeah, my best friend obsessed with the Portland Timbers.  I like it when they cut the log whenever anyone anyone scores a goal. You don't watch enough.  top American soccer  International soccer. Okay. Well, I can't see how you're doing.  Have you entered stuff? Okay, let's just hit the button. No one got be correct according to the system.  Probably they lose their Knights game.  Okay, the 9th game is just like the first there's nothing special. So it's just a complementary probability. Let's try another lose their first two games and win their third.  seeyourchart  Innovation it's in our DNA.  What do you mean?  I hate nonsense shirts.  Well, what's the right answer? Apparently? It's B again.  You probably found the explanation here. We're just stringing together a bunch of Bernoulli things and Bernoulli things are independent.  So I guess we're assuming they're independent here.  Soccer players don't remember what happened the last game. They have no moods, right?  Okay, let's try another one lose every game in the 16-game season.  Should I hit the button?  Yeah, you can people ready. Okay.  So just string together lots and lots of losses and become multiplications when you have independent things. So if 16 things multiply to get something raised to the 16th, I'd love to know how many people should be right. Now. Those are people adding stuff together. For some reason now for my favorite question, which of these could be for newly events for newly trials.  Got to remember. What is a Bernoulli trial?  Is it only lettuce supposed to let spread into?  well  Here's a programming fail Socrative writes this thing, right? Okay. I select the correct answers. And so it's like oh there must be two correct answers. I won't let people see more than the number of correct answers in the system.  socrata broken  you want to see the correct answers?  How'd we do? So what's wrong with a comes up on a fair six-sided dice? There are six possibilities. Not too. It's not a binary each by the pizza taste good. These are not independent.  He probably saw in the answers.  It's not like I take a bite in the next fight. You don't know what's going to happen.  You know exactly what's going to happen right whether it rains or not each day this week storm systems move in So Random Number generators are a good result or a good example of a new Leaf things if it's truly a random number generator and all you see if people can bark about pseudo random nonsense. I don't care.  Red or green ball those in the binary Choice has only red and green balls that helps to get binary and you put things back.  That re-establishes the original state and makes independent events.  Okay.  So there you go. Now, you know some things I'm curious what's going to happen when I download that the empty file. I don't know. We'll see so now you're up on Bernoulli things and you can combine them all together, right? So we're not ready for the common questions. He was our first common thing that comes up all the time to think about what human beings care about in life like best in first or cesspit these things. So what's the probability it takes exactly k,  Okay, good Berry Bernoulli trials to get your first success is going to do something over and over and over until finally the miracle occurs and you get the success you wanted in life.  Now it may not seem immediately. Like these are things that commonly come up but playing games until you get to win flipping coins until you get a tails.  Looking through emails until you get non spam. You don't have to deal with too much of that anymore because Google made your life better didn't they?  They just filter everything and make decisions for you about spam and not fam. You don't have to make your own decisions. So this is one fifth time that I will get that success and the first 24 were all failures. Another thing of my tasks on an average how many times have to do something before I finally get the success? I want in life. How many job interviews do you have to go on before you get hired? How many dates how many times have to swipe left before? You can finally swipe right same thing?  So these kinds of questions whether about Tinder coins cards, whatever.  When they're about the first success, this is called the geometric model and it's the first one that people tend to learn when they're doing probability Theory because it's the gentlest.  They only get more complicated now, there's something different about these kinds of questions here. The first round of questions was all about probabilities, and these will actually be Rose in our probability table.  And the second big question here was all about the expected value. You can also ask about how spread out your experience will be. Yes, you're wiping left and right hoping to Fall in Love or Whatever tenders for.  I'm not sure what it's for anymore. I've never been on Tinder cuz I don't have Facebook.  Any sort of needed one of those for the other for a while maybe now you can do it. I don't know about Facebook.  So let's go build a probability table first and those Socratic questions were sort of a warm up for this. So one thing is interesting about this probability table that we haven't had before is it goes forever?  It is possible. You have to flip the coin a million times to get heads. It's very unlikely but it's mathematically possible. It could be a billion. So there's no end here to the table. So you just put it... And we'll figure out a couple of the Rose and then we'll just do a general row.  So first if it's going to take exactly 1 trial to finally get success in life. There's only one way to do that you succeed immediately lucky for you if it's going to take 2 trials, you have to fail then succeed. So that's what the Q in the PIAA representing and you need both of them to occur, which is an and so they get multiplied. You can imagine what fee of three is going to be. You got a failed twice then succeed and that's how you finally got your first success on exactly the third trial and it's actually includes the success in the counts.  Directions to see it because you know, you stopped so that's why it's included in the counts. You could probably fill in the Row 4 x here it's going to take exactly x times before you finally succeed and you failed x -1 x which is where we get all these beautiful tattoos. And then we had R16s on that last time it was so beautiful.  So you can see every row here is basically answering a probability question probably takes three trials exactly.  and you could think about  I took the expected value. It's this waiting of all those possibilities based on How likely they were.  So we need to go figure out what the expected value is of this random variable. And guess what you got to add up infinitely many things now contrary to what I heard an office hours today.  It's possible to add up infinitely many things and it ain't Infiniti.  Sometimes it's Infinity. Sometimes it's finite you might recall 20V. You added up some infinite geometric series.  We got up to a finite number 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + to me so long, that's too.  So just cuz you haven't been in meetings to add together doesn't mean you get infinity. Sometimes you do homework problems about that. Anyhow, so we have now figured out the probability for any Row in the geometric model X 2D X - 1 x p  Now if you want to set up a random variable that is modeled in this way there two different notations people will use wanted to say okay. I got this random variable X and you can just say equals GMP pajamas geometric model and is telling you the success probability for the Bernoulli thing that you're doing over and over and over be a coin flip be at rolling a die and looking for an odd number maybe.  other people who use this little Tilda answer your books and you can read this as X is distributed as  And we'll be using the word distribution A Lot distribution probability model. All these things are kind of interchangeable.  People aren't really super careful about they also to blend together. I will go back and forth between these notations so you can feel them both and decide what you like the danger with the equal sign is you're putting an equal sign between  strange things random variables and it's unclear what it means for two random variables to be the same.  Basically, they need to be able to take on the same values the same probabilities, but you're using equal sign in a way that you've never really done before and is pee is what we're going to call the parameter. This is some summary information about a situation. So the perimeter is that you need to know about geometric model are the expected value and the standard deviation deviation. You can get the variance by squaring it so you can prove in a class like 180 a  at the expected value for geometric model is 1 / p  This makes sense. What's your flipping a coin in the chance of heads is like point one very unlikely to come up heads.  And you ask yourself? How long do I have to flip it before I get heads while you have to flip it a lot, right?  And if the probability is very big and getting heads you shouldn't have to flip it so much. And so this reciprocal creates a kind of thing. 104.1 is 10 your foot a lot.  Standard deviation is not obvious where this would ever come from. If it is also just a fact that pops out when you do a complicated calculation answers of any random variable. So you just have to apply it to the setting now the calculation is complicated and takes a long time. So, let's see if we can do this quick your turn.  Flip a coin until you get tails.  How many times on average?  dos  So the knights way to restore the model this is to say, okay. I'll set up a random variable X and you have to remember what x means this is the hard part is just a number of times you're doing this thing. Whatever it is in the problem until you finally get your success with a number of Trials.  So here it basically an average takes to Flips to get Tails, maybe believe that in your soul.  I don't know. The standard deviation is have spread out. The experience will be from one person to the next if they're desperately trying to flip tails and this case is square to so you can use to sort of Addis standard deviation and subtract 1 and this will give you a good sense of what a lot of people are going to experience. There's no exact way to do this and we'll talk more about that later, but I want to show you that.  We can actually stimulate all these results. So here's are we going to do I don't know if your cat is going to work. We're going to figure it out just flip a coin. Calm your all going to go there.  your goal is to get tails and you just going to Flippin Flippin Flippin hit the button until you do what you have to count how many flips  and then you going to send me that number in so proud of  Not looking good for Socrative right now.  sokratis broken  Luckily, we'll just take this dataset and pretended to you. How's that sound?  Let's go to minitab never seen this before this what we use in math 11. I thought you might want to see it.  So here we go.  Minitab is like Excel but a tiny bit better?  So here we go season number of flips.  some of you got there immediately with all the ones  did you get some different kinds of coins or did you just use the one that gave you?  It's kind of cool as you can flip all sorts of different coins from different countries.  Okay, I'm looking through the data.  Hey, this is a star. I'm going to take the word and when I converted it to a numerical and it's like  I'm just going to ignore that 110. How do you feel about that?  Can I throw it out?  It's possible possible. Is anything anything is possible.  Okay, it's not even that unlikely. It's like 1/2 ^ 10.  What's that one of the 256 or 512 whatever multiply that by the number of people in the room will probably get one of them, right? Okay, so I'm not going to throw it out. I'm going to stab leave a bowl.  Anyhow, let's make a pretty little histogram of what's going on.  So you see this variability everyone took a different number of times to finally get your your Tails or heads or whatever you were looking for. Okay. So if you make a histogram, it will sort of show How likely these different outcomes are and they should stretch all the way to Infinity. They won't  But here is sort of the picture of the probability model now, it's not exactly the probability model.  Because we use real data instead of theoretical things, but you can see things that are more likely to borrow will be higher than K1 was the most likely thing apparently.  It will turn out that's always true for a geometric model and Minnesota falls off and it could go forever if we had infinitely many people doing this.  This could be your job. Just generate data for the rest of your life for the simulation. Now, let's say I wanted to find the expected value.  What operation do I need to do to the dataset to approximate the expected value?  You think I should just take the average? Let's win some basic statistics.  Some people said the weighted-average.  Okay, this is  A simple average you say they're weighted equally already.  Okay. So this is where it gets confusing. You can either take the possible outcomes and do a weighted average which is what expected value does or if you just generate lots and lots of data it already has the weeding built-in. If one is more likely I'll see more ones in the dataset. So then you just do a simple average. So I'm just a simple average. If you want to know the spread you can go say I want the standard deviation, which is one of these checkboxes here.  Okay, so hopefully it's already checked it is.  So we're expecting to get the numbers to which we get right here.  Today is the expected value and we're supposed to get the square root of 2 for the spread. So if you look in the standard deviation.  Is that about the square root of 2?  Do you know what the square root of 2 is?  1.414 close enough, right? Maybe we'll throw up at 10 and then the data will be more perfect. Now don't do that. Terrible manipulating the data. I'm sorry, so crowded was broken.  The internet doesn't work.  So what's visualized the geometric distribution in general?  We're going to get a picture very much like what you saw. So let's deal with a probability of heads here that to you should change it. So it's not the normal thing that always happens.  This way you can see that we get a similar picture. Okay. So here's the probability table just to remind you. It's basically lots and lots of fuse with a p at the end of them. And here's what a picture is if you make a nice one and some piece of software. It shows all the possibilities that could ever happen for the random variable goes on the horizontal axis or on the x-axis, which is weird. That's not normally normally like looking over at the y-axis to see like what comes out of something but it's on the x-axis here and the y-axis measuring How likely you are to see that  now you might say like is this always going to happen is the first bar always going to be the tallest in the answer is yes, if you just think about the calculations okay in this tasty is going to so that's how high the first bar is as you can see from the formula the next bar supposed to be Q x p l q is less than 1  so whatever. It's what is scaling it back to make it even smaller.  As for the next one, we're only doing 80% of the number to which gives us .16 and every time as you move from one bar to the next 15 x q with Peach and bringing it down.  Now if you wonder why it's called the geometric model.  Anyone have any ideas?  Yes.  Say that again.  Okay, so if you go calculate the expected value in the middle, you have an infinite geometric series the class can't see that right now. So I'm looking for something that is more visible on the screen. You need to be less clever. You're too clever.  What you say?  It's like a right triangle. How does that relate that the geometry? Okay.  That's a bit weak.  This is going to be curvy but you're making it straight. It goes forever. That was nice. No, never done that before I go ahead.  I can't hear you at all.  How is that geometric?  Are you guys keep saying the word series when I adding things together? There's no additions. Yeah.  Oh my God, I'll draw the red fulcrum for anything. Even the non geometric ones.  Okay, I tired of waiting. Look at these numbers go spawn a geometric sequence.  the common ratio is  Cute, that's how you get from one to the next right? If you add them together and do some weeding, whatever you get geometric series. Anyhow, okay, so there's our balancing Point you'll notice it's not at the highest point. The expected value is not wherever the graph is highest. It's where the thing balance is when you put your finger in her knee didn't cut it out of cardboard. Let's see how you do quick spam problem.  This is true. By the way, 91% of all emails are spam.  Google hide that truth from you in Gmail.  You turn off your spam filter in each day. You count how many emails do you need to read before you finally get to an actual message?  Then you go to the beach. How many messages do you expect to have to read when you wake up tomorrow?  Would it be strange to have to read 20?  How did you define a random variable?  With a capital letter the values of which are the values that are interesting in the problem. So here x is the number of messages you have to read.  Until you finally get a real one and it includes the real one.  Now we're looking for real emails.  The probability of getting a real one is .09 so you shouldn't have the .91 that's you hoping to get spam in life.  That's about 11.1. You should not be rounding that then you can go calculate the standard deviation in this problem by using the formula to get 10.6.  And it looks like our results.  20 would it be strange to read 20 that's within the standard deviation. That's very common even within two standard deviations is usually considered quite common, but more on that later.  Consider this geometric model you got to make sure that you set up. The thing that you're looking for is the success probability P that helps to have memorize these expected values and standard deviations. They come up so much in life. That's one reason to do it and they're also not into it is so if you forget  you're not going to guess your way back into these.  So that's one reason to put them in your head forever. So that the first kind of common question now II.  It's about to get harder.  So what happened last time this we didn't did the Bernoulli thing over and over and over endlessly until we finally got a success so that can go in a billion trial so you can get lucky and six the thing that's different about what we're about to do is you're going to do the Bernoulli thing a set fixed amount of times. That's a 10 and could be whatever number you want. As long as you just said is the beginning flip a coin 27 times go. Okay. Now what you care about is how many successes you get out of those end.  You can put the same thing this here. Now we tend to think about wins in a season for some team. So there and is Fix-It. How many games you play? And you would care like How likely is you win two games versus 20 and you can ask the same thing on average. How many wins are you going to get out of those fixed and number things are going to do.  This can have the same settings also. So this model when you fix the number of times you going to do something and then look at how many successes you get within that is called the binomial model.  So if you're ever going to be using this you should be searching for that fixed value.  Now the number of successes that are going to happen can vary and that just creates the different rows in the table.  Let's see how your intuition is about Bernoulli or a binomial things that is confusing cuz now, you know, Bernoulli and binomial Bernoulli is the simple little cookie. That's binary success failure.  Binomial takes a certain number of those in xeroxes it end times.  They're going to flip a Fair coin exactly four times.  probability of no heads  probability of no heads versus probability of one head  and what's the most likely number of pets? I'll let you think about this for a few minutes.  Listen to build intuition around binomial things.  All you people thinking about be right now. I see a lot of people saying that they're the same.  And the logic goes something like well to get The 3 Tails.  What's 1/2 cubed and to get the one head? That's 1/2.  Sure, seems like 1/2 to the fourth. Doesn't it? What's the problem with that logic?  Portland  There's more ways. There's lots of ways to get.  3 Tails and a head  you can in fact list them if you want the head could come first.  The head could come second.  Those are different things, right?  They made all reduced down to the phrase one head.  But there's actually four ways to construct getting one head and three Tails. Now what you're noticing is if you look at any one of them, it's a 1/16 event, but there's lots of different ways to make it. This is so confusing. Why does life have to be so complicated?  most likely thing  That will be the value two heads. The reason is there's lots of ways to get two heads. Now, if you look at any particular Arrangement will have two tails in two heads 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 at 6:20.  But there's so many ways. You could be hhtt you could be htht could be and so on affect their six possible Arrangements.  That's how I got 6/16.  1/4 is getting exactly one head.  And the second question is exactly two tails.  Now that's a little warm up so that the following slides don't hurt as much. So let's go through these we're going to do a Bernoulli trial a total of end times each time. It's are there a success or failure heads and tails if you want first thing we can do is build the probability table and one thing that's interesting about this. It doesn't go on forever.  The only possible things if you're counting the number of successes and you're doing something and times you could fail every single time. You could have one success to all the way down to succeeding every time a miracle.  Oh, wow. Now two of these roads are easy for human beings to do in this class. So here's the easiest you're going to know success is you just need to fail every time. So the first one is a q. The next one is a q they're all cues and there's any of those because they're in different times. So you get to the end you can probably guess the other e0  the last row because you just win every time in life.  If I going on Oprah, right, everyone's a winner or something you get a car and you get a car and everybody gets a car.  So just go succeed in times. Each one has probability p  Now in the middle are the complicated ones and the reason it's complicated is because if you just think about one success.  You've got these different slots that I could occur in.  So what you need to do is go figure out how many different ways there are to list the letter s when there are any spots and all the other spots are going to be failures.  That's okay. Another nice thing is if you look at any one of these you can go calculate its probability, but they're all just joined from each other. So you got to add them all together.  Mk7 any one of these you're going to succeed one time? That's the key and you're going to fail all the other times that skew to the end minus one. So the hard part is simply the counting process now, it's not hard when there's just one success to put down. Right most of the people in the room will realize that there's any possible locations for it.  Okay. So what we need to worry about is when there's more successes to be put down and we're going to need the chew symbol to help us with this. She probably come across the symbol before it's a way to calculate how many ways there are to do something in life.  So here you might care about listing One S among all the apps. I just said the answer was in but in general if you've got any spots and heat spots, I there going to be a success or failure letter in it. I must say you want to drop down k?  successes  Well, there's lots of ways to do that. And so what the symbol n choose K. Does is it counts how many ways?  But you can drop from the sky a different success has befallen spots.  And the other spots must be failures. So there's nothing to do there. You can just automatically write in all the failures.  Now this is new for a lot of people you can use this nck notation, but it is less common. It's on the way out. So you may not want to just dying notation.  Now, it's me putting a new notation on something doesn't actually help you calculate it. I just renamed the problem to some symbols. So it'd be really helpful if we had a way to calculate it and it turns out you can show a sequel to any factorial / K factorial times and minus K factorial and you will call the factorial just multiplies integers starting at 1 and going to whatever place you tell it to go to in life.  So that's the factorial.  Okay, so if you want to do this in a calculator and get a TI-83 or some TI family thing, it's under the math probability menu for probability. What do you know? They got one for stats to all calculators do basically NCR. That's the way they do it and you can just go type in something whatever you want. Okay, so apparently if I choose to attend  If you like or instead you can just use the word shoes and it will do these calculations for you. And you also get 10.  So now we're back to the probability table and we can complete it.  So let's slow down our thinking and dig through this.  We would like to think about one success.  The inches one is saying hey, there's a lot of ways to do that. It could be in the first spot.  The rest are failures or could have been in the second spot the rest are all failures. And so it's counting up how many ways there are to construct this idea. And then each one of those will have probability to the end - 1 * p  That's just making the successes and failures actually happen rather than identifying the spots in which they will occur. And how many ways there are to name those spots. Okay, if you want to successes choose your two places among the end spots were the successors will happen. Boom. Okay, and then make all the successes and failures occur in those spots to the end - 2 * P Squared  I just called the binomial model because it's using these choose things and he's actually show up in the binomial theorem.  X + y ^ n equals some horrible summation remember this from your past?  Hey, that's why it's called the binomial.  And you'll notice here that I also rewrote the first line so it had N20.  And the last one so is and choose one and she's in now both of those are equal to 1.  Okay, if your goal is to have in spots and you have to put in successes into them, there's only one way everybody's a winner.  And if you're going to have to have any there's only one way to do that.  Everybody so loser.  That didn't come out, right?  And if you need to actually see what's going on, some people like to see any actual example. Okay, so I say you're going to do something 5 times and you care about succeeding twice. What here's me listing every single way that can.  where those successes occur this n choose to defy choose to  And it's telling you that there's 10 things in this list year.  That's what they choose symbol does and if you look at any one of them anyone actually accumulate all its probability.  Then you have to go multiply the cues and peas together.  Essay on an exam and you need to evaluate some shoes symbol. You can always go back to factorials help you do this.  And you can wait everything out the long way and then do some canceling.  Okay, you can think about canceling before you actually write everything all the way out or whatever way you want to do. You'll get the right answer there as long as the steps are good.  This just gives us the probabilities.  Now I have to worry about the other things are going to happen.  So if you set up a random variable X it remember, what is it doing? It's counting the number of successes that can vary.  When you do something exactly end times she had to be told what it is to make any progress on this. You also have to be told what the probability is it anytime you flip a coin. It's going to come up heads or anytime you read an email. It's going to be spam.  So that's part of the model parameter list. So this is harder because it has two parameters that must be specified to make any progress in life. Where's the geometric which only cares about one for the probability of success? Okay. We just figure out the probability of getting K successes with n choose k x the appropriate peas and queues.  And now we need to go through and do the expected value in the standard deviation. These are kind of believable for a lot of people.  If you're going to do something in X and on any particular time.  It's going to be a success P percent you might believe you could just multiply those to figure out what's going to happen on average.  You didn't need any fancy things to do this.  Okay, if there's a 50% chance someone identifies as female in the room and there's a hundred people in the room.  You expect to see about 50 people that identify as female right? Boom Miracle approve this with all the horrible things definitions of expected value, but you don't need to do so, the standard deviation is not something you'll guess your way into the square root of npq.  Hey, this is just some fact that you want to go memorize.  Now if you want to practice these I have some problems here at the end, but it really get you going.  And you might want to try these before you start digging into homework about binomial stuff, but that's way in the future after the first.  San Diego  visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
