I think these are the Yeezy coming down off all the difficult things from the course. You've already seen all the Frameworks everything difficult. Now, we just do everything with proportions. Okay.

Then we'll go over to two populations and will only deal with the independent universes. We won't deal with paired proportion stuff.

So let's start now you might think that we're going to need a whole new infrastructure, but we won't and the reason is the proportions are basically I mean, I don't know if you've ever thought about him this way. So you're saying calculator proportion you say well how many people how many people have the thing I was looking for it?  How many total people were going on? Well, that doesn't feel like an average at all but  If you take everyone that had the thing maybe they self-identifying some certain way and you give them a one and give all the people that don't have your trade is zero.

So first thing I want to do is set up our notation. So we're going to use P for the population parameter up in the cloud now, that's not a Greek letter.  Sorry.  And I mean is p hat down in the sample.  I guess that feels a little Latin to me. So that's going to be our parallel for X bar. The only thing we have to figure out is what the sampling distribution looks like. So imagine you want to study something. Like I don't know percent of people that identify as LGBT and you plan on doing some sample.  Okay, and maybe we'll make our population San Diego and here's the answer quote on quote for San Diego.  Based on huge large studies of the LG d80 percentage here in 2016.  It's about 3.9 and ranks us about 21st of the most LG G LGBT places in the US you can imagine number one would be.  San Fran  number two  New York good  Okay, I see you don't even know that now so we want to figure it out. So I imagine you don't see the 3.9. Okay. So what are you do you draw sample? Some number of people that use five hundred and then you ask those people how they identify and you figure out the percentage or the proportion in your sample that say they identifying this way now usually but you could imagine doing this with another sample and another sample after that and forever new sample, you get a slightly different value of P hat.  and if you took all those P hats and you dump them into a histogram you get this picture and that's how the sampling distribution we saw this when we did means  So all we have to do is figure out what career we think that looks like where we think it's centered and how spread out it is.  I can imagine you can already see some of those things. Okay, so you probably see the normality.  And this case it really is normal. I'm not going to like change it to some other distribution in the future.  You can see just by looking visually where it seemed to be centered. It looks like it's about at 3.9. And guess what? That's the value up in the cloud.  If things really are 3.9 in San Diego and you go ask a bunch of people your sample wants to tell you what's going on. Just want to lie to you and give you 17%  I mean, I guess maybe from Hillcrest or something, but then that's not a random sample. Any more like an is a reason it's bigger. It's not easy to see from all this is the standard error that is how spread out this picture is just another case for I tell you the formula and you can't approve this and like 181 a 9 x q that's one minus your proportion or 100% - if you're dealing with percentages as we are here and then you / \u221a and so one thing will feel familiar about that and it said square root of n in the denominator. We have that for me and also right so the numerators just a little different here.  And there's no more standard deviation.  Because we're dealing with proportions so we couldn't put a signal up there would make sense. So let's try little one here has 200 random UCSD students.  Do you self-identify at the current moment as LGBT? However, that's too fine for you and 8 say they do so let's build a 90% confidence interval for the true proportion.  Whatever that is of UCSD students, they will self-identify.  Case of the framework is going to look similar to what we've always been doing. So first of all figure out your best guess this is your sample statistic.  It used to be called xbar but now we're dealing with portions. Right? So it's p hat. So it looks like 4% of our sample said yes, I identify in that way.  Then you break out of confidence interval formula. Now. This is always your best guess padded.  The pattern is always going to be on some curve or be related to some curve that was her a sampling distribution here. It actually is normal. So you really good to use yeast are here and the standard error formula. I just had in the previous lied.  Okay, so if you want to do 90% confidence draw yourself a normal curve, but 90% of the area in the middle and then figure out what place you have to go to the left and it's negative version to the right to capture all that area. So I'm using our to do this with our handy. Dandy to Norm.  And that tells Destiny star that's go there critical value.  All look the same right? Nothing's new. That's the cool thing and then finally just plug it all into the formula. Now, here's the new thing about all of this you need to decide in life with your percentage person or a decimal person.  Make a decision to decide where War right?  Four barriers to say that okay, so you can see me here doing things with percentages. I decided to be a percentage person and it matters because you need to be consistent. You can't use .04 at the beginning of the expression and then 4% and 69% next.  Okay. Now you'll notice in this case. We don't actually know what p and Q are the whole point of the problem is to  Come up with a reasonable range in which they live so as we've been always doing.  You don't know what's supposed to be there. You just approximated. So here I put key as 4%  I put P hat in. Does that bother you?  You're more last time when it was Sigma over the square root of an and I just started putting in the standard deviation.  And you were like, oh and some people got all worked out and they came to me an office hours me like can you do that? That's not really Sigma standard deviation. And then we came back like a month later and I was like other assistant call the T distribution we have to use if you go any make that substitution and you replace signal with the standard deviation. And then I told you the truth, right and now we're going to find well in this case. We don't actually have to go to some new distribution. The normal model is still really the best choice. Okay, so make that p and p hat feel good about it and don't be worried that I'm going to pull the rug out from under you in the future.  Okay, then you get some answer. So that's what we think. That's our best guess of what's going on at UCSD. Does this feel like a reasonable range given your experience with people on campus?  I don't. Did you feel the LGBT Ness of the school as you walk around or not?  What's that mean? You need more LGBT friends?  I don't know. I don't know what the real answer is. I just feel pretty good. It's in there 90% good.  Oh my God, that was perfect.  Should we ask everyone in this room know?  Oh my goodness.  Let's out everyone. Is that what you want to do?  Because you can't trust anything. You can't trust any data, even if we get through socrata.  10% of snow crabs always trolls every single time. It's always trolls.  We can trust any data. Okay. Now maybe you're upset with me right now cuz you're a decimal person person great. Here's what your problem is. Like you spend a lot of time riding a lot of decimal points. And that's fine. Okay, when you go find p&q you have to do one minus not 100 - look that's different. Okay, that's fine. You won't be that small person now the pros of being a decimal person.  I don't know the cons you spend a lot of time writing decimal places. And if you round to three decimal places you basically round away most of the answer over here when you're around a couple decimal places, you like 14 deeper into the expression, whatever. I'll let you choose what you want to be in life just be consistent.  Now's the moment. You say wait a second all I care about in life all those pesky conditions. You keep bringing up all the time.  Do we really get a normal curve like seriously?  Like if I build a garbage sample every single time, is it going to make a normal curve if I keep building a garbage sample now, so here are the conditions you need to actually get a normal curve. So first of all, when you build your sample, the people are items that make it up better be independent. That is you can't just go into Hillcrest and make your decision about the LG to be LGBT percentage because Lucas has a high LGBT percentage. So soon as I know one person from Hillcrest Inn at the Hillcrest example. I know most of the answers are that's not  Where do things out? You can check you the randomization and 10% like before so there's nothing new there. Okay, that's the way it's worth human beings deal with this one. We used to have something in the population or if it was skewed then it was okay. If and was big fish. That's what he used to be in spot to but now we're not measuring a quantitative variable anymore.  We're just like it's a yes or no. Do you self-identify as something? Okay. So here what you need is at least 10 successes and failures or successes. This is what I'm looking for in a failure is that's not what I'm looking for.  So what this effectively does why you want this?  If you're trying to study something and it basically doesn't even show up in your population. You have a problem you needed to show up a few times for the statistics to start taking other one.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  10 of each so  If you look at our last problem, for example 8 out of 200, so we had eight successes. Whoops. That's not good and we had a lot of failures.  OK Google always add up to the sample size. So we shouldn't have said we should have built our confidence interval in the first place. That was all a lie on the previous slide or imprecise if you prefer that so let's go and get some 10% roll data.  Where does one buy a fan?  That's fantastic.  What conference?  host m  if you guys are interested.  I was down since 4 out and stand so if you self-identify as LGBT or maybe you're straight supporter and you want to go see what that was like and see what stem looks like for a queer professionals. You can go do that.  Let's see 810 out of 1012 randomly selected us adults.  I don't know how they did that favor creating higher fuel efficient Lee efficiency standards for autos.  What on Earth are we starting in the problem?  What is a parameter?  How'd we do?  Very good all the people that shows are your thinking sample. You're still in a sample parameters are in the cloud.  Okay. Do you want to build a 70% CI what calculation would be most helpful in the middle of all the work?  Did you visit SpaceX?  You're just a fan of Elon Musk.  Of his intellectual capacity or of his personal identity.  intellectual capacity mostly  okay, if you want to build a confidence interval you need that thing called d-star that's a place on the horizontal axis que. No one finds places on the horizontal axis and finds areas.  that's why I P Norm isn't right which of the following correctly find 70% CI select all  call Christian. Okay. So what just happened it says select all why would you choose just one?  Because you think I said select all is a trick to get you to select more than one.  Text The Meta Meta level.  How'd we do?  Good.  Most of the weight of the answer is on the correct ones.  Look at those people mixing.  How's that feel?  decimals and percents in the same problem you say  Do we meet are we allowed to do inference?  Okay, the people that shows a that's not a condition related to proportions.  We need to be because of randomness.  And there are more than 10,000 120 adults and we definitely have 10 successes. We have 810 successes and we have three 200 is failure. So we have plenty next one.  Here's that your poor your confidence interval.  Now we're going to having lots of percentages. We are 70% confident that the percentage of u.s. Adults who favor is between 78.7 and 81.3%  Okay, so it's currently 78.7 and the other number right? So whenever you have a percentage it's a percentage of something or have some property. So here this would be all us adults.  And what are they have? They have a desire for higher fuel-efficiency standards.  Okay, this interval is built around trying to figure out things.  related to the idea PE  Hey, let's try the next one. What is the percentage on the number 70 refer to?  Oh my goodness.  You finally have it.  What is the silly confidence level it's measuring what percentage of the random confidence intervals that could have been built based on different samples would have the true population parameter in them. So if you've ever wondered precisely with the 70% about it's about random confidence intervals that come from random data sets and they're centered around their particular P hats.  Anything you want you want them to have tea in them?  That's what that refers to it takes a long time to understand that. Okay. Let's finish with that.  yummy troll data  now you're ready for hypothesis. Testing.  And one of my favorite problems.  You heard of this before?  you have  death postponement  Do you have control over when you die?  Mostly, let's say you're not intentionally trying to do it.  In fact, you're trying to keep it away.  Mostly, what about when you're in the end of your life?  be like, I just want one more day and then the next day I get home or  Now when people first see this idea. This is insane. Okay, just postponement. Theory says people somehow can delay their decks until after some important life events another lots of different important life events. They may be your kid is going to get married in the marriage is scheduled for three months from now, but you're pretty sick from some disease.  You hold on to fight everyday to see your kid get married.  Does it matter if you cry or not? Can you control this?  When you think in your head changes reality?  Placebo effect you think we placebo effect our death. Also, we placebo effect lots of things. So let's go figure this out. I'm going to set up a variable for us. The parameter is about the population percentage of people that died in the three-month window before their birthdays. Okay. So everyone has a different birthday switch have to do with your taking human being see when their birthday is looking at three months before.  And then see if they died there or not.  Well, everyone cares about their birthday, right?  Oh my goodness. Can't you get me anything?  So right H, not NHA using my beautiful variable P that I was kind enough to Define.  Everyone dies.  Maybe that's true Kayla take a bunch of people that are dead look up when they died.  Look up when their birthday is.  See if that's in the 3-month window before or not.  Okay. We'll see how you did if death postpone is pure nonsense, which is probably what most people would walk thinking in.  Then 25% of people should die. There's these 12 months three of them were before your birthday. And if they're just dying at random points and has nothing to do with your birthday it sort of uniform through those 12 months to expect  3 out of 12 or 1/4 people are going to hold on.  And if they get near their birthday, they're like don't I don't I don't die in the birthday hits and then they can let themselves go there after.  Wait till you see the data if we assume it's not as true. What is our sampling distribution when we reach out and collect data from the universe. Where do we think it comes from?  So I want a specific nervous or place is Pacific spread out in s  Okay, someone tell me what you think.  Go ahead normal. I agree next where should it be centered where we think it's a nerd.  1/4 + 25 write are you a decimal person?  Okay, we'll keep being definitely spread out as it is variation rights not always going to be recognized as weird.  P x q around with a square root. Okay. There we go.  So I did that fool just for you.  Wasn't that convenient got to pick on the people that you think are definitely at that moment in time. Otherwise you get in trouble. So I'm expecting the universe to tell me 25% but I know that this is a little higher 1.58% higher maybe a couple those hire a couple lower and be reasonable.  Now the data comes in so they did a study in 1978. They looked in Salt Lake City for some reason.  okay, noodle 474 death certificates  And 60 of those deaths when they looked at birthdays happened in the three-month window before the person's birthday.  So take all those numbers and put it into a tight little cookie for me.  With the right notation on it.  You got to believe in yourself. You can't use my facial expressions to decide whether it's right cuz you know, I'm just going to manipulate the truth.  if it's right, I'm always going to be like a and if it's wrong I'm going to like  okay, hopefully roky hat this is information about the sample use P hat for the sample statistic going on in the actual date on okay 08.  that weird  draw me a picture of the sampling distribution of P hat on it and shade me a picture of the area that represents the P value.  Where is through the same steps?  Maybe they're starting to feel repetitive now since we've done them so many times.  Define variables set of hypotheses.  Draw me a picture of a sampling distribution shaded area find a p-value draw conclusion. Looks the same on every homework problem. I give you right.  You put .08 pretty close 2.25.  How spread out is this curve?  You want to see the actual picture?  Look up all your .08 are so close to your .25.  Through the actual picture when you drive in a piece of computer software and you actually put the appropriate spread out and it's on it. I was expecting something near 1/4.  .25. We got 2008. Well, that's kind of far away. But is it really that far away all depends on how spread out the sampling distribution is the sampling distribution, isn't that spread out you were willing to tolerate like one? Who is this number?  1.58 you go down that much or maybe twice that much.  But look how far it is down. So there are shaded it and there's our p-value. Oh my goodness.  Still think that postpone run is nonsense.  Placebo effect over someone's life.  Now I know what you're saying. Okay, you want me to reject H. Not remove DHA doesn't prove the death postponement is true. Maybe Salt Lake City is a weird City.  I lived there for two years. I would know and you say okay, but that's just like you know, what's in Salt Lake like this does Americans right? Like Harvest Moon Festival has exactly the same phenomenon.  And if you look in Israel around important events, they're the same phenomenon occurs. They're basically every single Society has this phenomenon of death postponement is pure Insanity people hold on until important things. Your birthday is coming up. You ain't going to die.  You're going to fight right?  You want to get to that number?  So this is an example of a statistic like I don't even need to run the statistics when you sees 8% you're like whoa, and if this feeling in your soul like something crazy just happened. Okay. Now let's talk about sample sizes.  What's my little problem here?  measuring Donald Trump's approval rating  you can ask her for the 95% confidence interval.  And a margin of error of 2% or perhaps less would be okay.  You see currently it's hovering around 41%  I was watching the political shows on Sunday and they bring up this number 40 41%  Donald Trump can always get 40 or 41% on almost any question you could possibly ask they're always 40 or 41% of Americans that are die-hard and it's a true actually have lots of political parties. There is always a die-hard base, but it doesn't matter almost what happens.  But you still believe in your candidate. Okay. So anyhow 41% That's the best info we have walking it. Now what sample size should you draw to meet all these weird demands?  The first thing you want to do nothing about the confidence interval. Here's the formula and you noticed that the plus or minus amount is what dictates the margin of error you have your best guess if he had you go up a margin of error that makes the right arm and you go down in margin of error. So what we like to do is set that expression for margin of error equal to what our boss has demanded.  and when you're actually drawing samples in real life, this is how you decide how big the sample is going to be how wide you want the margin of error to be when you put the study up there on the screen on CNN and in tiny print you reduce the margin of error that no one cares about her pays attention to  that's what dictates your sample size believe it or not when it comes to proportions.  Okay, so 95% you're used to this 1.96 here. Here's me putting in the formula. Now. The problem is the formula wants the true value for p and the whole point right now is to build a confidence interval because we don't know Pete.  Now, what do we do? Well, sometimes we'll put P hat there.  In order that P hat you have to have already drawn the sample.  This is so infuriating.  So what you can do as you can put in your best guess based on some previous data.  That's one option right here. If you have some previous data, okay, so if you have to use it, if you don't have that then use your best guess of what's going on. If you don't have that then we'll deal with that in the moment and you have no idea what's going on. Okay, so here as soon as our best gas 41% I'm going to go put it in there.  the reason I used the percentages here instead of the decimals is because  has nothing to do with these are my taste or anything like that.  Well, the question wasn't percent. Okay, so that's when we like I wrote this it's too right here is 2%  Right. It is 4.02. Then I'd have to appoint for 1 exactly. So how are the problem giving it to you? If you use that then you need to maintain it and if you want to change it to your system then fine or change it to your system has just become solving a pushing around a bunch of stuff, right? Okay, so I got the square root to the other side. Then I broke up my calculator.  In squared both sides and did all the math and when you do this you going to go to horrible decimal.  And you have to decide what you going to do with it now and represents a number of human beings.  So unless you believe in fractional amounts of human beings which our constitution did for a while when it came to voting rights.  What was the Pro Bowl?  3/5 without the percentage. Okay. So like people are in this world. I just don't understand. Sometimes we're going to make this and you should round up in these problems. The reason you round up is because if use exactly twenty-three 23.2 people it exactly makes the margin of error what you want.  If you use slightly under that number if it's a slightly smaller interval.  Play slightly bigger interval.  Because your n in the denominator here.  Is the square root of ending this denominator if you round down it divides by a smaller amount which makes a bigger margin of error by a tiny amount there is Roundup on these problems.  Okay. Now I know what you're saying like isn't it sort of cheating to use the previous data about the approval rating to decide on what you going to do for the new rating like I could have dramatically changed who knows what happened in the last 5 minutes in terms of tweets. So let's try another problem. And this is what actually happens when you have someone when you have no data about someone. Okay. So like some new Canada joined some brace and you must have proxxon 8 what percentage of people plan to vote for her?  I know Paul has ever been done how large a sample must you draw. If you want your 95% CI to have a margin of error of 3 and that phrase means exactly 3 or I'd even okay if it were a little smaller, which is what happens when you round up. It's a tiny bit smaller.  Okay. Yeah, I usually want to find the fewest number of people to guarantee that 3% margin of error.  Okay, so you have to take the words in the problem and realize what they're really asking. What's the smallest sample of size? You could draw that would guarantee a margin of error of 3% or less. So here's our formula again.  Okay, and we get the same problem. I'm using decimals this time.  How's that feel?  If we have enough metal conversation about the silly thing that no one will mess it up.  Don't you think?  Yeah, I still mess it up myself. So okay know where we going to do here.  What are we going to put in for p?  when I can move things around, it doesn't solve the problem that we don't know if he  We don't have a sample.  We're going to figure out how big to make a sample we don't have any previous data what you want to do.  Why would you use point five?  I agree. It's in the middle of the range 0 to 1.  But I don't know why that does anything for us.  Right. I agree. We don't have anything and I agree. Yours isn't middle. I'm just not convinced. It does anything. It's the right answer for some reason.  Go ahead.  Maximize the what?  maximize p x q  Okay. So what you want to do is plan for the worst possible thing that could happen.  Cuz we don't know what's going to happen Okay, so if you look at this right here and you say okay. Well the size of an is going to be based on the size of p and Q the product actually.  And I don't know what that is. So let's plan for the worst possible scenario. Let's draw a sample size. It would work regardless of what p&q secretly are and we'll never know. Okay, so we'll just choose the valley that maximize the expression p x q now is it clear that 1/2? Does that?  Why does 1/2 maximize or make the the worst possible case for p x q?  Go ahead not even in. This class near answering stuff is amazing.  You need at least 10 successes and failures or answer must be pretty big.  So we're about to get an answer is probably in the thousands. So we're probably going to attend successes and failures and that's were studying something incredibly rare. What do you say?  Out of all the rectangles squares have the largest area.  Do you mean out of all the rectangles with some constant fact about them Squares have something?  out of all the rectangles have some length and some with  Okay, your your soul is in the right place something something something about maximization. What's true about p and Q. How are they constrained?  There's some equals one case out of all possible p's and q's that add up to one supposedly the maximum p x q is when p is 1/2.  Derivative. Oh my goodness.  p x q is equal to  tee times what?  That's equal to P minus B squared something about derivative setting the meatballs setting it equal to zero.  Okay, you don't have to do that. Pete * 1 - P that's a parabola with roots at zero and one it goes downward because of the negative P Squared. So the maxim is right there at 1/2.  So if your goal is to maximize that expression it happens it 1/2 Okay, blah blah blah. Lots of words look plug in 1/2. You can just memorize this. This is in fact that they do in political polling often.  So just said worst possible scenario. Okay, it gives you the biggest possible sample. Could you now. The biggest thing here but it will guarantee regardless of what's really going on that you meet all these requirements. So here's our huge value. Now, this doesn't necessarily guarantee of X successes and failures. You're studying something that's incredibly rare less than one out of a hundred ninja starting to get into a danger but usually no like  independent political candidate more than 1% support  I hope you know I can probably not studying someone that's so off the radar. Okay now let's try another one.  We'll get edgier and see how you feel. This is an actual study.  From a recent Journal article Daryl bem is the author if you want to know.  Found evidence for extrasensory perception.  Now here's what happened. They took a bunch of college students just like you they walked up to a computer there were two curtain shown.  Behind one of the curtains was an erotic picture.  Behind, the other curtain was nothing just blank.  And the person walks up they look at the screen and they are hit a or b based on which one they think has the erotic picture it reveals. Then it brings up a new thing again.  Now I put erotic picture here not to be Sensational but because that was actually the study they tried it with all sorts of other pictures non erotic imagery.  and college students couldn't get any better than chance, but when it came to erotic pictures  You can go look up the study it got published in one of the Premier psychology journals.  During a room there in a room. There's no like outside forces. It's all computer randomized. Okay. So the way it works is like it puts the two things up. Then the computer randomly chooses. One of the two things to stay it's behind and then the person text images that does the reveal don't even know and the grad students running.  Oh my goodness.  So 1560 trials?  829  we're done correctly.  now you probably have some feeling like  this is totally reasonable. I believe in ESP or this is totally ridiculous. I have no idea what's going on right now. How could this possibly be the case?  But this is the study. This is what came out.  Okay, so let's go run a hypothesis test.  First thing if you super boring if USB didn't exist, you might get excited in life. It's suddenly someone had some extrasensory perception and could tell what was going on behind the screen of a computer.  Okay. Now we need a parameter. We need a variable. This is the percentage of times that a person can guess which one is the erotic image?  And if it gets pee doesn't exist, then you just randomly guessing A or B is a coin flip me trying to guess what how the coin comes out. Okay, so that's why I P is .5 in this is a one-sided alternative cuz he said something very specific. You can do better than chance.  Now, what's our data? Let me divide the numbers for you 53.1%  What do you think? Is it so much bigger than 50?  That you're ready to move to the alternative.  Or is it close enough? That that's just sort of a brand you get that from random processes?  Well, we have to know the sampling distribution. What are all the results we could have gotten?  If we assume the null hypothesis, so let's go put that down just a distribution will be on were expecting the universe. We do the study to give us something your point five, but we recognize that there is variability and what we can get out on a call if the universe because Randomness makes data weird some time to get things a little ball. Sometimes you get in below.  Now how much is the universe willing to tolerate in terms of how weird it gets hears the spread .01 to?  It's willing to go up one of those are down one of those or maybe up to those and down two of those.  53 is right on that cusp, isn't it?  So let me draw the picture and let's exactly calculate what's going on here.  So this red area here is our P value. I should had one way because we have a one-sided alternative only excited about big results. They lend support to the alternative and make us want to move there basically.  Okay. So here's the calculation P Norm on finding an area under a curve. You can see me doing it on the sampling distribution It Center 2.5. There was the spread here's the number and I want to say to the right. This is our P value.  .007. So if you use a .05 you are about to reject the null and move to the alternative college students are better than random guessing. It's selecting erotic imagery behind computer screen.  I know some of you don't like working on that distribution you like working on the normal distribution. We can go do that if you want.  All you do is you go calculate the z-score they take what's going on? That's our value here subtract the mean and divided by the standard deviation and it will tell you in this is Basis the says like this is 2.45 standard deviations above normal.  That's all that says normal point five nights how far it is above?  What do you think?  Tell me how you feel right now. That's the end of this example.  What do you say?  somebody  Okay, so you're saying if we did the study times over and over and just have you look at erotic imagery all day?  Eventually some weird samples going to show up. Okay, and you feel like that's what this is. In fact, that's exactly what this is. They did the study on all sorts of imagery friendly imagery, you know pictures of dogs and clowns in this kind of stuff and they did it on the slight negative imagery and they did so many kinds of imagery and then they get this one that pops  And all the other stuff, they don't publish the 19 out of 20 studies that we're just sort of like there is no USB, but the one that did they go publish and then the research literature gets flooded with all this nonsense. That's just weird random stuff. Like you said, that's exactly what happened to her. Don't we got to stop we can talk more have a great break. Thanks for coming today. I'll see y'all Monday. "
