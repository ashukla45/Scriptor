These are all probabilities.  Okay, here's a picture from 2016. This was the day of the election that morning and you can see that 5:38, which is a data journalism website.  Gave Hillary a 71% chance of winning you obviously know the result of that.  But I should point out that if you go to sources that actually know what they're doing when it comes to probability modeling you get this kind of result, you know, this basically a 70-30 split.  If you go to places that don't know what they're doing you get Hillary has a 99.9% chance of winning this right?  Now if you can get a good data about what's really going on it changes your reaction to What happened if you were shocked.  The Hillary lost and Trump won.  Then these weren't the numbers in your head. You didn't have good probability information. And if these were the numbers in your head from had a one out of three chance roll the dice it comes up one two, are you shocked?  You're not shocked at all. It's a very boring event to could have happened, right?  So we need to start thinking about probability and making this very rigorous. Now. There are three different main ways that people conceptualize this idea.  First empirical probability if you want to know the probability of something happening do it lots of times over and over and over and just see what proportion of the time it happens. The coin comes up heads 50% cuz if I flip it ten thousand times I get roughly five thousand heads empirical means Based on data. So just go collect a bunch of data.  So this is in contrast to theoretical probability, which says let's build some sort of mathematical landscape for what we're talking about and somehow use that landscape to back to arrive. What must be going on.  Last time I checked the coin had two sides.  So one out of the two sides is heads one out of two is 50%  There's a more mathematical way to do this and it would be more useful when we do more complicated things already. You can see here with the dye coming out to an even result. You ask a small child with the chance and even number comes up in a die. It's not so obvious. If they don't have this mathematical model where there is six different phases half of them happen to be even intense 50% might be the reasonable value for an even roll.  Now the problem with the first two.  Is that they don't always work. So subjective psychological emotional probability says feel it in your soul and spin out a number.  What's your chance you get an A in this class? Well, we're not going to repeat this thousands of times, right?  And how do I model this?  You either do or you don't 50% something's wrong with that model.  Okay, so we got to deal with these different interpretations and they'll bleed together in real life. And so we're going to extract out some of these and look at the more deeply in this class.  Now you might say it just the first one even make sense. Can we figure out how likely something is by just doing it a ton of times?  And maybe it's totally obvious that that should be totally fine.  But it turns out that's not so easy to prove.  Okay, so we've done this with coin flips probably at some point in our life like in first grade maybe when you didn't know how likely it was so what did you do just started flipping it a bunch of times and you get lots of different results H's and T's and you can sort of accumulate those results and you can look in your accumulation how many you have their ages versus the length of the accumulated thing and you would really hope that about 50% of those letters are H's in your big string of things  Inferring fearful probability to work you need this to be about 50% When you do it a huge number of times. You never flip it once and make a decision, right? That's not enough data to do this with a die. The singular of dice. You can just roll it and roll it and roll it and you can say will how often do I get the number for so this access is the number of times it was rolled and this access is keeping track of what percentage of those roles actually came out to be for since it's one of the six sides you would hope the answer B16 2.16 repeating you'll notice when you don't roll it many times you getting very erratic Behavior.  But the cool thing is and this is the important thing about empirical probability as the number gets really really big.  Everything approaches through a limit the true value of a this graph has a limit that limit is the probability of rolling a 4 on a dice.  So the law of large numbers says if you do something lots and lots of times it will have a limit.  Super Convenience, because that limit is a number and we will assign it to be the probability of the thing. We're doing lots of times and looking for  Having trouble with the law of large numbers.  Is the people forget the word large in it?  And they feel like you don't need a large collection of data to get something to look like how it should look in life.  And when you abused the law of large numbers and ignore the word large people called the gambler's fallacy.  So gamblers have this idea some if you were not old enough to do this in America.  If you start gambling at some game Blackjack Keno, whatever.  And you've lost a bunch of times you feel like you deserve to start winning.  The universe owes it to you and the truth is the universe does over to you over a large.  Number of Trials. So if you go in for bad dates, the universe doesn't owe you the perfect person on day 5 it owes you the perfect person over a million dates or whatever is going on. So the correction doesn't necessarily happen in the short-term. So I lost three hands of blackjack time to bet big cuz I'm going to win that next when I'm due.  The short-term is such a frustrating thing. You do this when you drive right I do this when I drive I get pissed off how many red lights I sat at night deserve a green.  Well, you just didn't pay attention when you got all those greens last week the university gave you the niceness. So sorry now you really should have lots of Reds in your own the Reds and even pay attention.  So the issue with that thinking is all about short versus long-term and the word large in the law of large numbers.  So there's some thoughts on empirical probability and anytime you can repeat something great. That's a nice way to figure out the probability. In fact, you can ask really really complicated questions.  That are simply solved by just doing it a bunch of times.  Now, let's go to theoretical probability vocabulary here and see if he has to learn these and some various settings and we're going to have all these come up through the class the first trial. This is some sort of action random action that will create some data people like to flip coins that I could pull cards out of decks of cards, but I wanted to show you in this last one the bottom that it can be more complicated. It can mean walking up to three human beings and saying are you on Facebook and the answer is  Yes, yes. Yes. So the date on that I just collected his three wise.  Okay out of this trial that we just happened. Now anytime you go collect the actual value get is called the outcome. That's what actually came out of your thing.  Yes, yes. No.  It's different than no. Yes. Yes because you are different person than he is. So there's an order to these things. Sometimes you don't care about the order of stuff and then yes. Yes. No would be the same as yes. No. Yes, you just got no, but sometimes it's different human beings and the order matters great question.  Now the event is something you care about in life. Sometimes it's getting a particular outcome.  But sometimes it is the collection of lots of different outcomes. For example, drawing a spade. There are lots of outcomes that will satisfy your event that makes you excited in life.  The Jack of Spades the nine of Spades each of those individual thing as an outcome and together they make up your event.  So if you know about set theory that is just a set of some of the outcomes that excite you.  Now the sample space is everything that could possibly happen. If a list of all possible outcomes, so heads and tails on a coin 52 cards and when it comes to asking three people and Order really matters on who says what then you can see we have all these different possibilities in factor eight of them. Each of you had a yes or no to give me and so if I multiply two by two by two choices, that's how you going to hate.  Sample space everything now. The reason this is helpful is because once you have the infrastructure in place, you can actually just to find probability.  So let's say you have some event a it's a list of things that you would be excited about occurring.  So the probability that a occurs turns out you just be the size of a that is the number of things that are in it divided by the total number of things that are possible in the universe. This is why flipping a coin coming up heads probability one might think I'm excited about head is one thing and it the sample space is heads and tails  This only works and this is super important whites and read this definition only works if the things in the the possible outcomes in your sample space are equally likely.  And here's the perfect example to show why this matters if you ask someone what's the probability they get a hole in one.  the next time they go up to haul answers not 1/2 you either do or you don't want over to  the trouble with this is yeah, there were two outcomes or either do or you don't but they don't have equal weight. But getting a hole in the wind is a very rare event. Where's the knot is incredibly, so you need everything to have equal wait before you can count up and say Here's how many things are in it, and I'll / how many  Oh my goodness. Now one thing that comes out of that definition immediately is the probability will always be a real number between 0 and 1.  Now you may have thought about probabilities as percentages in your life 40% You can always convert percentages over to decimals. So I think it's very very helpful to just commit to using 0 through 1.  Instead of percentages will go back and forth. But the one you've done less with is it the .25 rather than the 25% So just live with it for a while because it's the uncomfortable rare thing.  Can we try some?  Here we go. I'll go first probability of rolling a prime number on a standard six-sided die.  Oh my goodness. Prime numbers are the reason I do this example first is to establish beautiful notation.  If you want to get good in this class having good notation is the first thing you should do is the transition from the problem in the words in English to the mathematical Universe you need connective tissue. So here's an example let a be the event of rolling a prime number now. I don't ever have to talk about primes or anything anymore. I just talked about  And this is where the efficiency now takes over. Yes, you have to wait this long sentence, but now everything thereafter is quick. For example, you can represent a has a set here are the prime numbers one is not prime. You should know that.  It has to do with the definition divisible by one and a number other than one and only those two things.  Okay, sample space you can use S if you want in this class. It's a natural notation and you'll notice already. If you're paying attention. Did I use uppercase letters for events and uppercase s the sample space which can also think about is the event the event. It's something occurs in life. That's what the sample space is.  Now I have to do is take the size of the event and divided by the size of the sample space 50% chance. I'm getting that prime number on the fair 6 sided die.  Will make it harder.  And I strongly encourage you to Define your events.  Here we go coin flip 3 times.  Find the probability of getting exactly two heads. Good luck.  Two people have the answer 3/8.  That I looked at.  Must be true, right?  Does the order matter?  Okay. Well, this is where it starts getting complicated. There's me to finding an event getting exactly two heads in three flips.  Maybe order matters to me.  And then when I lift things out, I will always care about order.  Maybe order doesn't matter to you and you will never think about order.  And then you might have a problem. So he was molesting everything that could happen.  There are eight possibilities here 2 x 2 x 2 based on each coin coming up heads or tails and you multiply you don't add the way you know, you multiply I just listed a different thing so 6 can't be the answer proof by example.  Okay. Also called the multiplicative rule in probability and Counting. Anyhow.  I'm just going to put a box around the ones that are ones I care about their they are clearly I care about order and how I'm doing things, right? Okay, so I'm going to get the answer 3/8 like everyone did the problem with not caring about order is it's very dangerous. If you don't care about order and just list them alphabetically Kayla's heads heads Heads. Hht right.  The trouble is those two things HHH and hht do not have equal probability as you can see like there's lots of ways to get hht if you think about it ordered for a second. So most people think about things nice and ordered because it ensures that helps make all the outcomes equally likely  now, let's say you wanted to figure that out empirical you don't care about my theoretical probability This is complicated because you flipping 3 coins, right and you want to repeat that triple coin flip over and over and over.  So it involves like a 3 and then a do it a bunch of times. So you have to like go to lots of human beings. You can have three coins and you can have three coins in everyone can have three coins you all do it. And then you scream at me yes or no whether you got those two heads.  In the amount of gases I hear is dancer the percentage the volume of the yes is 2/3 of the room screaming. Yes. So it's a very awkward thing here to do this just cuz it's complicated another one.  two four sided dice plural, finally  What is the probability that the number on the first is it least the number on the second two minutes only this is harder.  and if four people have the answer 5/8  Let's see.  It written 100% of the people. I sampled got the same answer nothing. It's correct. We'll have to figure that one out won't we?  It helps in this case. I have a way to represent what's going on. I gave you that way in the previous problem are listed. Hht on the previous slide, so as to help you figure out how to organize it. Okay, you can do the same thing here. If you want you can put a, between them in parentheses, and now it feels like an ordered pair from math. Okay, but still just two things together United.  Now this is interesting because we care about D1 being greater than or equal to D2. And this is a case where the easiest just to list out everything in the sample space and then just to check off the ones that meet that requirement like in the previous problem. So here's everything in the sample space 4 x 4 of them then you can start to see the multiplicative nature of what's going on cuz you get a row idea and a column idea. It's why we multiply stuff and I just put a box around the ones that meet that requirement now, I have to decode what the phrase at least means.  If English isn't your first language, then you just have to memorize that in English. We have this weird phrase and it means greater than or equal to.  There is just a memorize fact. Okay, so these are all the ones that do it so you get 10 out of the 16 or 5/8.  Of course, you can never trust a front-row to be a representative of the class.  Because I don't randomly put you in seats, right? You know how the front row is.  So the question is do I accept drawing this kind of stuff out and boxing it and giving the answer acceptable. Absolutely. I can tell it's going on your delineating the sample space. If you put s hear it's really clear to me what's going on?  And I can see even if you put some other stuff up here to help me understand. It makes it even clearer. That's totally fine. Now. All I have to do is put a problem where I know you'll never be able to do that.  Which I will certainly do or I can put problems out there that it's doable. But if you do during the exam you're going to blow all your time on it.  So use it as an actual good technique, there's nothing wrong with this but use it sparingly. If you ever find yourself wasting your life listing things try to get more clever.  great question  Okay, a few more thoughts and probability next how do you actually get 0 or 1 and what do they mean? Well, if somebody has it probably zero, it means it will never occur.  We are still in the universe of a finite sample space only financially anything's possible. So the only way to make a fraction 0 is cuz the numerator is zero, which means thing you care about is nothing in it doesn't happen and the only way to make probability one when it's a ratio is when the numerator and denominator to be the same. So your event has to basically be the sample space which means your event has to occur.  I would like the coin to come up either heads or tails probability one. It will do that.  Immediately think about landing on the side. Don't you? That's good. That's a compliment.  So you have this event and it's just a list of outcomes that you're excited about life. The compliment is just everything that ain't in your list.  but still in the sample space  so you don't need a new notation for everything. That is the opposite of what you care about because you can use the complement notation on what's going on already and it turns out the probability of a complement is just one minus the probability of the event you care about will see an example of that in a moment help you convince you a visualization. Yes.  Okay, so whenever you defined you're the problem is you're trying to like get to real life too much sample space everything that it can occur event some list of these for the compliment then it's just a set theoretical thing. It's all the things in the universe that aren't in what you care about. So if you can define a universe for me and you can find these cases you're talking about.  Then you have compliments. So let's talk more after class so I can understand better what you were thinking about right now. Here's an example. It's like really simple you care about rolling an even number on a die. Obviously. The compliment would be something that's not even  odd 0 is an even number by the way, if you're wondering about that people get confused all the time. Now, here's the visualization of what I was just saying you can always make the sample space seem like a square and the stuff inside is the stuff that could happen.  And Evan an event then it's just some subset of this you little Universe. Okay in the complement will just be everything outside of the circle, but still inside the square.  And the sample space has to have area one cuz the probability that something happens in life is one something will always happen Okay, so now you just usually see that this thing to add together to make one.  I will get there great question. In fact, it's happening right now.  Okay, so you could make two circles in here. Is there two different things about which you might be excited? Sometimes you just excited about a sometimes be or you can say maybe I'm excited about either of them happening. So you can define a new event A or B and you can use the word or if you want.  It's easiest way to say what you care about.  Now it will turn out you can just see from the picture. If you're excited about either red or blue occurring you can just add those areas together if the events are disjoint and just  Oh my goodness, the World falls apart just like that. So just join simply means that the circles don't overlap. If you think about it from a set theoretical perspective is a big list of outcomes it to set another list of outcomes if they're just joined. There's nothing that lives in both. They have no join when you put them together, they don't join up.  So let me show you how you might use this mathematically and it will feel better as we go through this a little more Fair coin flip 5 times probability you get 5 heads or  Exactly 1 tail. These are the two things about what you would be excited. Okay, very heavy or just a touch of Pale.  Very strange, but okay. So there you go. You can put letters on these if you want yours me defining my events.  And now from here on out, I don't need words anymore.  Kind of nice, huh? Let's go list within these events their sets contain outcomes five heads. There's only one way to do that in life. Everything turns up heads are lots of ways to make one tail.  If you think about each coin as really being a different coin now, we're flipping it 5 times, right? So it's the first result and the second results and they're different things and the order matters to me cuz I'm going to get excited about Tails followed by a bunch of heads or a bunch of heads followed by Tails. I will get excited and both of those cases.  Now, you know just by looking at them. There's nothing in common between those they have no join or just joint.  So because of that.  If you want to find the probability of this or event we can just ask the probability of each of these now. This is our first case where we're getting to the point where it's exhausting to list the sample space how many things are in it?  I heard factorials and powers and all sorts of exotic are there. I guess it's just through the 5th.  It's a little letter here as two possibilities and you multiply to get the combined effect. So there's 32 of those. So now that will be the denominator when you find the probability of a and it will also be the denominator for be  And I just counting up how big a and b are and putting those in the numerators.  To feel okay about some more events now how to write them how to find them.  You're good.  Go ahead.  Oh my goodness. Yeah, you should always make every choice in life that adds more work for you.  The Re-Up, yes, you should reduce your fraction.  Oh my goodness.  Now just join this is hard for people.  If you've seen if you take a 109 for example, and you've done all the set notation, okay sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set if they have nothing in common when you try to overlap them and look for what's coming to them then notation doesn't help you then. Don't worry about that. Okay for me if I ever want to know if two events are disjoint.  And all I do is say can I think of something that's in both of them? That's it.  So here's some examples of disjoint things on the left and even number on a die. That's two for six the other vendors of five. There's nothing common there red or green versus blue or orange. And here's an interesting one any event and its complement. The compliment is a list of things that aren't in the original event.  So you can't have any overlap. So your turn. You got to tell me why these are non disjoint.  Who wants to be the first one?  Go ahead.  4 is an even number and a perfect square amazing. You found something that lives in both of my events who wants to do the next one?  two front row e tired of the front valve  Go ahead.  MIT is an Ivy League school. Is that true?  It's in near Ivy school. Maybe it's up to IVs now. I don't know.  You can also choose Harvard MIT Harvard, whatever there's no difference.  Is MIT was not an IV for a long time and then I was like a near Ivy and then now I don't even know what to do anymore. Maybe you can't use labels anymore. So okay last one.  Anyone, go ahead Bo Jackson. What sports did Bo Jackson play?  Is that it?  That's good. See different kinds of people know the answers to these different ones. I love it hard to like no all of them. That was a great answer.  Are there any recent people?  If they both have sports.  Reese recent  Who is Deion Sanders?  I've heard of him. That sounds true. Is that true?  Can anyone confirm that that's true?  Internet ask Siri. She'll tell you.  Oh my God, I wonder if she could do any of those questions.  Cuz I asked her for something about okay.  Here's the next thing you is really helpful. So I got to add to one. So if you think your sample space and you just break it up like cutting up a pie.  If you got it at the probability of all the little pieces they've got to add up to one cuz that's what the whole pie adds up to right. So here's an example of where this might be useful in some problem. I guess you take the weather in San Diego and that's what you care about.  And someone gives you a bunch of different probabilities for sunny cloudy rainy and they don't give you smelly.  And if those are the only kinds of weather possible.  And there aren't many choices for what's know we could possibly be you taking the entire universe. So there's only four things you care about and you've got three of the four puzzle pieces size-wise so you can go figure out the last one just by doing some subtraction if you wish take one and subtract away all the probabilities, you know, and we'll tell you what your left over with so it's obvious statement, but it turned out to be incredibly useful and problems and it's one reason than an event and its complement must add to one cuz they make up everything in the sample space. It's the most boring division of just like cutting a cake into pieces.  Now this is where it gets hard the following slide.  We have to start talking about what are called independent events.  This is totally different from the idea of disjoint. If you care about the join us in life.  Ask a random person in the class if there's anything in both sets and just join this is an idea that pairs with or a or b.  Independence is going to be an idea that pairs with the word Aunt when you want both things to occur in life, and you're only excited if both things occur.  So we're going to figure out what event what Independence means.  Now one way to Define independent events is just to say events are independent if the probability of A and B just equals the probability of a times probability. You just define this word in terms of some mathematical symbols. The problem with that is it to help you understand what the hell this even mean for two events to be independent. So we want to have that mathematical definition and thing in her head and we also want to put some other contextual stuff on here. So here is the sort of emotional thing event A and B are independent.  If the event a occurring has no effect.  On the probability that b occurs and vice versa and this is best explained through some examples here.  So let's go see through some things that are dependent.  probability of getting into Harvard  one out of a thousand  some number, right?  Probability that a random person will get into some college.  I don't know 1 + 10 1 + 5.  Something right? There's some number that here's the thing if I tell you that someone that got into Harvard, what's the probability that they got into any college?  1  they must have gotten into some college because I can exact name when they got into so these events somehow or tied into one another knowing one somehow changes your opinion about the other.  There's a connective tissue getting a red card on top of a deck getting a red card as the next one in the deck.  Someone explain to me why these feel dependent?  Go ahead.  Okay, so if event a happens.  Then there's one less red card in the deck. So when you go to draw the second card, it's the deck has less ready than it was before.  If you don't know anything about with the top card is and you just decide to go in and reach for the second card and you've no information just a normal deck. That's half Freddy half the cards are red. And so these are tied together now. These are independent.  the chance of flipping tails on a coin is 1/2  Now I tell you a random person got into Harvard. Let's flip a coin.  Is there sound like metaphysical nonsense the ties a coins to Harvard people near them or something?  no, it's still the same like  so things are independent when they stand apart from each other and don't influence each other in life. That's what Independence that's why you want an independent Judiciary stand apart and is not influenced by what the executive branch does executive branch doesn't change how you feel like the judicial work.  heads on flip one example to  and this is a assume assume some Fair coin or what? It doesn't matter what its fairness is but whatever happens on the first flip, the new one is a new event that can do whatever it wants in life. It's not tied through time to the event the previous flip electron cloud connection or whatever. Yeah.  The sample space should never change. Okay. So this is you talking about this example right here.  Okay, there is a sample space set. There's an event a there's an event be set.  Now to decide if they're independent or dependent simply say, what's your probability?  Okay, if I know this one occurred, what's your probability?  You go through this game. It's a very frustrating game.  Okay.  You can if you can show the probability of A and B, give away to calculate that and your way to calculate the probability of a and the probability of a and b equals the product of the two, you know, they're independent. So there's a mathematical way, but right now I'm not giving you were just doing a bunch of touchy-feely cuz the math wall happen naturally the hard work.  Okay, let's try this one.  Sample space is all you human beings and your Twitter and Facebook usage or not. Okay.  A random person uses Facebook that same room person will use Twitter. Let's see first thing if you want to decide if these events are disjoint,  all you do is you say is there any possibility that they could ever both happen for a human being?  Are you on both?  You are in the join of the two. Is there an outcome common to both if you can find something the events are not just joined.  And if you can't find anything if no one in the world run both.  Wow, what a great world. That would be.  If you can't find anything, then they're disjoint. That's how you decide this by just thinking through the events and trying to find commonality.  Okay. Now here's the hard one Independence. I'm not going to give you a more sort of formulaic approach here. So first thing find the probability of event a feeling number whatever cuz you got a number, right?  The probability that someone is on Facebook. It's probably pretty high right I think in 1890.  85 will just keep going with you, you know all about that social media nonsense. Okay. So 35 now is the person behind the curtain their 85% going to be on Facebook right now. I go talk to the person. I'm like a  do you use Twitter and a person like you better use Twitter?  You still can't see them. How do you feel about their Facebook Inus the chance? They're on Facebook. You know, they're on Twitter.  How's your number changed?  No.  It could be.  Has your number it's it's a likelihood if someone uses that garbage Twitter.  Better use the gold if they're willing to stoop to Twitter.  You know that they're going to use Facebook right Pump It Up to 95. See you never changed. Right? Like I don't know what the real numbers are whatever. Okay, but if there's if you could believe that it would change that I gave you information. They need to vent or dependent. So do your answers come out the same or do they differ when you do these two thought experiments? This is how you decide Independence Day. So if you got the same number both times that information I gave you about them being on Twitter didn't change their Facebooking is Stan's independent of whether they use Twitter or not. Okay. Here are the actual numbers you were remarkably close.  The probability of random human being uses Facebook is actually about 70% You were pretty close. I mean your college student your whole life. Is this right? Now? Are you forget about all the old people that hate technology like me. Now, if you know someone's on Twitter the chances Facebook actually goes way up there using the lesser-known social media site visit their cleaner more PC way. And so, of course they're going to use the other one. I could love social media, right? Okay my goodness. We've got a couple minutes left. Let's see how you can do here with this one probability of rolling a perfect square number on a 10 sided die.  obviously labeled 1 through 10 and  not only going to roll a die. You're going to flip a coin can do them at the same time both things into the air if you want and you want to get tails on an unfair coin.  Where the coin wants to come up heads 60% of the time 3/5. Good luck.  One nice thing when it comes to physical objects that are different from one another. It's very hard for them to be dependent record attaching the coin and the dye they just do whatever they want. So if you know the divers all you've no idea what the coin did.  Doesn't give you any information. So here you go.  So I need to find my events.  I'm curious. How many in the room did Michelle 2 minutes where is everyone going?  This clock is wrong. Look at your phone. You know, we have 2 minutes.  No question right now. We've been nothing like to find events and encourage you to do this over and over and over.  Hopefully realize the coin in the dye not affect one another so you can break that and turn into a multiplication. So now you just need to figure out how likely a is a perfect square number is an integer can be another integer squared 1/4 and 9 or 1 squared to squared + 3 squared. The probability of getting tails is the complement of the probability of getting heads. So here we are using the 1-10. We're getting to fits you multiply them and you reduce your answer.  Getting 325th.  Now I'll point out. I made a bunch of Progresso difficulty questions. And so creative. I'm going to post that before the exam. So if you want to do some more problems and feel those will be available for you then but now I'm out of time. Thank you. I'll see you guys Friday. "
