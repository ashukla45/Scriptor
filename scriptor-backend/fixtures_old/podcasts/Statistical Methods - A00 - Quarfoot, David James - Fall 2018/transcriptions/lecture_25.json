    "Full Transcript": "Well, welcome back today the journey continues.  Oh my goodness, so we did.  Means in one one population means in two populations could be paired to be independent means in three or more using Anova then we reset and we've proportions one population to populations Listerine.  Three or more sort of that's what we're going to do today. So Chi Squared  is a collection of techniques based on the chi-square distribution that are used to answer certain questions and it can be a generalization of proportions to three or more if you think about it in the right way, so they're actually two kinds of chi-square test that we're going to study.  One is known as goodness of fit and you're going to be doing this anytime you have a one-dimensional table. That is it is a row or if you want it is I'll call them it's known as a vector in a lot of languages and we use test of homogeneity or Independence and we have a two dimensional table. You might know this is a matrix fall UCF people.  Okay, so here's some examples of questions that you might ask if you had a goodness-of-fit and that was what was going on. So, for example, if you look at the birth months that are going on in NHL hockey players. What month were you born in?  Will they represent or will they good Leaf it?  The u.s. Population so goodness should really be Wellness, but you know adjectives adverbs who really cares another one if we breed a bunch of peas and make them happy babies. Will we get the results that are expected when you was mendelian genetics?  Does breeding actually have a good fit or fit well.  To mendelian genetics, you believe it don't you you took some classes at told you was true, but is it really so this first example comes from my favorite academic from obsessed with right now, his name is Malcolm Gladwell. He wrote books like outliers and blink that maybe you've heard of I think it's brilliant because he takes phenomena that you feel in your soul and you've always held your whole life, but you couldn't articulate the new digs deep and explains it in a beautiful clear way.  So here's all chart of data. I put together based on his idea.  So here we go with the different months, right?  And on the left here is how many babies were born in that month for some year doesn't really matter. What year OK and you can see what percentage of the babies are born every month. Now, it's not one over 12 as you can tell from the data. It's roughly 1/12, but there's some months that are a little higher like August.  now if you back up nine months before August when people make babies  What's going on then?  August is what month number?  8 so subtract 9 you get 11 or 12?  -1 months. Yes, that's called December.  Something got everything much. Alright, what happens in those months like 11:00 12 + 1  Huh?  It's called cold. And what do you eat when you're cold you're inside and what are you doing? You're inside?  You make babies.  How do you take a break?  Oh, you pray under a blanket? I forgot about that.  Okay, so that's why November is a little higher in the US because it was like interesting friends. Now, that's not all though. You may not have realized happens in the cold months. Take all the players who have ever played in the NHL is about 7,500 and you just look up one month. They were born in and then you figure out what percentage out of those 7500 each of these months is attaining.  And you notice these numbers.  Look nothing like the numbers over in the left-hand column for percentages of births by normal human beings.  Oh my goodness. Something is strange in the data.  now  if you want to run a statistical test to decide if the strangeness is so much that this couldn't just be chance creating this.  Maybe I took a weird year for the babies in the US or something in the world. Whatever that is. Okay, so you need statistics help you decide if it's strange enough that you're going to say. Those really are different.  Now the first approach you could have is like well, let's do a month-by-month comparison the proportion born in January for hockey players 10.3 vs the proportion born in January. Then what's for Pete for February and March and April and so on so just run 12 proportion test.  Oh, sometimes running lots of tests as bad cuz data just sort of Pop as something interesting when it's just random chance. So what we need is a way to sort of compare all those proportions together in a single test.  And the way you do this is actually not through the proportions with accounts accounts are just or so the proportions are just the counts divided by the total, right? So it's really the same question. You just get to work with integers instead of horrible decimals for most of the time. So, what do you do if you take first-year observe counts? Okay, that's actual data. So it should be all integers and then you say what would I expect?  If there really was a goodness of fit if the normal Baby Trend fit nicely in good  On two hockey players. Well, how would you figure that out? So you would take your 7476 hockey players and you say let's just multiply it but what if I wasn't normal baby's due in January OK and in January normal baby's about 7.98 2% of the birth will happen in January to just take the proportions from your other universe and just apply them to this new place of hockey players in the other direction. You could have said this to take the normal babies and make them look like hockey players. So it doesn't matter which way you go here. So that's how you get that number and in general you can get any of these numbers by taking your total count that's going on and multiplying it by the fit you think should be fitting this population, which is the general population percent of babies born in a month * total hockey players.  Okay, so these are called the expected counts if your theory really does fit good.  Then that's what we should have seen and you notice I didn't round these numbers did I that's because they're just theoretical expected ideas. It's fine if they're not integers, but they're not actual data.  And by rounding them you just like making things more in precise. I really expected 596.72 babies.  So never around expected counts. So what set up some hypotheses now, it would be super boring.  If hockey players and just fit the pattern more generally in the populist.  You wouldn't be excited at all, right. You probably already thought that was true walking in even though you would never thought that thought before.  every Super interesting if there were something different which is to say that any one of these proportions across these 12 months didn't align  now the question is how do you test all of these ideas at once for a Nova? We had some like mean acid MSC and MSG and all this complicated stuff, right? So here again, we're going to have something complicated to run the test simultaneously at once. So enter the Chi Squared  Stat Health weight distribution  So what are you doing? You take each observed in each of your bins. So here the bins are the different months.  You subtract what you expected a square it to make everything positive and then you scale it.  By how much you expected?  Hey, so if my salary is off by $1,000.  And I only make $1,000.  That's a really important difference.  If my salary is off by $1,000 and I'm expecting to make a billion. I don't get worked up, right that's why the denominators are there or Tamp down things when they don't really matter. Are they expecting much going on in that category anyway, so who cares if there's a big difference in the category that you didn't expect much in.  Now what value should Chi Squared be near if H not really is true. We're going to assume it's true.  But if it's not is really true.  Y0.  Fhh not says that this world looks like that world. So when you take the other world into a cloud on top of your world if they really do fit nicely The observed and expected to be very close to one another.  So all of these little differences in the numerator to be near zero, okay. So if we get a big value for Chi Squared something is wrong if we could value near zero.  Everything looks exactly like we are expecting now. There's different ways to think about this one is a visual way. I've been showing you this you can plop those counts if you want.  And some people love the visual medium.  What do you think are the blue and the orange different from each other on Mass?  That's what this test is going to do. Make us decide this in a more systematic way.  But the human visual complex will be like, oh something's weird there.  So we're going to figure this out. So the bigger chi-squared is the more evidence we have against H. Not let me show you a Chi Squared is for this problem.  This is me. Just plugging in those observed values and those expected values. You'll remember to square it because you don't want anything negative plus negative and positive could cancel each other out. The hard thing is to remember what's in the denominator.  And this is just something you have to memorize basically so I got a number 258.  Now it seems pretty big but how big is big is the question?  So what we have to do is figure out a curve to drop this down on and shade some area. This is what we always do right. So you need to know the possible Kai's words that could have occurred.  And this is called a chi Square distribution. So are Chi Squared stat will feel like a z Stat or a t Stat or any of these things from the past.  Which curve do you put it down on unfortunately, you don't put it down on a z distribution or t distribution.  Otherwise, it would probably have a different name. We're going to put it down on a chi Square distribution. Unfortunately, there's a family of those.  Well, which member of the family so if you go study 181 B.  You'll learn that the correct number of the family is the Chi Squared with K - 1 degrees of freedom. So there's some indexing parameter again, and the appropriate one is K - 1 is the number of bins that your data have been sorted out into so we are 12 bins. So you're going to have chi-square to 11.  Okay, I hear some chi-square distributions. If you want to see what they look like beautiful, aren't they?  They mostly sort of go up have a hump and then come back down.  Except chi-square to which is frustrating and sort of start super high and then comes down and breaks the mold, but there are some different types of distributions. It's just a new family.  Now the probability density function for this hot mess.  Once you learn the gamma distribution, then you can learn the chi-square distribution. Once you learn all those and you can ride the T distribution in the F distribution it just layers and layers and they just get Messier and Messier until you say enough and you give up in life.  So for us we care about chi-square at 11 now that square up there is not squaring things. It's just a symbol.  I keep calling a square now. There is something called the chi distribution, which is the square root of the chi-squared and it turns out to be useful but it's another one of these cases were like you introduce a symbol that looks very scary like the bereans and sometimes you care about it, but you're not really thinking about it often is a square only when you're taking the standard deviation and doing something for you. It'll just be like a little hovering symbol up in the exponent 11:11 and I'll plop 258 down on it and once I do that I need to shade to the right.  shooting to the left Shades off toward zero  and it's near zero that you're supporting H not we actually want to accumulate evidence for the alternative basically or whatever. The alternative direction is, which is always bigger values of Chi Squared. So there's not much area going on there.  You basically in almost all software when you ask it to find that area. It'll say the area is 0 because it doesn't have enough decimal places to even give you any it is bigger than 0 technically, but he value of 0 mm .05. We're going to reject a null.  Does anyone know why?  Hockey player birth month percentages are so weird.  Have you read? No?  I'm I'm impressed. You don't even need to say it and I'm impressed you earn that you just got it now to see if anyone can figure it out.  Who hasn't read the book?  Okay, take a chance.  Sorry, can you speak louder first of all?  The championship is during that time.  Okay, so there is something beautiful in that.  There's something about hockey and timing that matters what you said is not exactly what we're looking for. What do you say?  Okay. So now you're saying something about timing that's more in line. So you're saying maybe the season when it begins its somewhere in the year and maybe there's like cutoff to get in or something and that aligns something something something.  Play anyone else have an idea.  Are you ready to share what you think? What do you think is going on?  The kids are born each day.  It start earlier.  Yes.  Something like that. Let me clean it up a little.  hockey players come from  Canada  At least for most of the years of the NHL now, it's gotten more diverse and you get all these are Czechoslovakian players and Swedish players. But anyhow, okay. So now we need to go.  Okay. Well something about when students are allowed to join school. Okay, you have to be a certain age before you're allowed to go to kindergarten right and that age cutoff is determined by some January 1st or something.  So, I don't know something or just said whatever it is, but there's some cut off right and if you just missed the cutoff.  What are you do you sit around for 11 + months before you're allowed to go to school and finally get in kindergarten when you show up the kindergarten you're not four years old, you're four years old and 11 months. So you're bigger. You're stronger you're faster. So then what happens then all the adult pay attention to you?  It's true. They focus their resources on you. They're willing to work with you have to practice because you're better than all the other kids and that snowballs as you said year after year you remain better than everybody else because you're older than everybody else. And hence. You had all that yours those years to develop. So that's what Malcolm Gladwell.  So outliers is the book here and it talks about like these are birthdays outliers. They just miss some cut off and so they have to wait around for most of their life to start but then they're big and strong. So here's the summary to put it all together.  chi-square goodness of fit  There's two universes you're excited about counts for some phenomenon, and you're going to compare it to something else.  Some theory of what's going on. Maybe it's a theory dictated by what baby should be looking like in general.  We're about to do Gregor Mendel's peas. So you first calculate the expected counts. So you have you observed counts of hockey players, then we built what we would expect if hockey players were like, whatever.  Population were generally as what we did here you can compare hockey players and football players and what you would expect.  So then you calculate the chi-square statistic should bees eat near zero if it's not really is true. But you're going to believe in when you do this hypothesis test and when that value gets big it's because it's not really true anymore.  Okay, then you look it up on this weird curved. I swear. It's okay minus one case the number of Divisions that you broke your data into if you're thinking about proportions, then would be the number of proportions that you wanted to sort of compare all simultaneously.  Now the H not here is usually best to say in words some Theory applies in our setting and the alternative is the theory doesn't apply. Some people will say hockey player January percentage equals General baby, January percentage hockey player February percentage equals and so on. I don't need you to write me 12 different proportions that you all are hoping or equal to each other.  By just saying the theory fits then you summarize that idea the theory fits the count should be roughly the same the proportion should be roughly the same as you look in every single bin. It's just the fastest way to do it.  The other thing I noticed there's no two-sided alternative. I just shaded to the right.  That should feel very much like a Nova and the F distribution.  Same thing here. They said the theory fits the theory doesn't fit. That's what the alternative in no always feel like basically, so let's try another one.  Is a bio yet?  Remember this picture somewhere along the way so you have a mom EP and a DP if you believe that peas have sex's and it must be heteronormative.  Which is not a proper description of many of the meeting practice. He's out there in the world, but I don't know about peas.  So I don't know what we're going to do here. Whatever you want. Okay, so here's the parent.  So this is heterozygous, which means that it has the capital letter in the lowercase letter.  So the r stands for the roundedness Jean it's either rounded or not rounded which means sort of crinkly or wrinkled the why is the color Jean? So you're either yellow or you're not yellow which apparently is green. Great. I don't know about peas, but there you go. So on the pop the parent is hetero. So it has both the upper and lowercase letter and the other meeting P will also be heterozygous.  Now when the peas meet you get one of the ARs and one of the wise I don't know if it's uppercase or lowercase, right? So if you get the uppercase version from both parents you get this thing and it turns around and yellow because apparently round and yellow or the dominant traits.  I'm so proud of myself for doing all these words right now.  Oh, well, I almost went to med school. So I guess I should know a bunch of Bio, right?  Now you can notice that you can create all these different genotypes. That's the letter strings but then those get mapped out two phenotypes what it looks like when you visually look at things and there are fewer phenotypes and genotypes MK so you can see it if there are nine yellow ones here and it did a round in the three ground round green ones and so on.  So theory predicts based on this picture.  If when you get your genetic material, it's just a coin flip. What am I going to get from Daddy the uppercase y or the lowercase why it takes you down one of those two columns, right? And what do I get from the other parents at the coin flip? So it's these things should occur in a 9-3 3-1 ratio if everything is good in life if you believe Mendel  So, let's see you decided to test.  So you go run 100.  Create 100p babies.  Is take these heterozygous parents spit out the babies. I don't know how it works.  Anyhow and then whichever hundred babies you just go count how many of the four different phenotypes you got. So here they are observed.  What do you think?  It's clearly not 9331.  Positive. Is it so far away from 9331 that you like.  done  Mendel Stone  What is your soul tell you?  Someone take a chance and tell us what your soul is saying right now.  Okay, what's your soul say?  Good enough. How did your soul decide that?  Okay slowed down. So 5 + 62 is  close enough to a 9-1.  How did you decide it was close enough?  Okay, I'm coming some calculations. So whatever you see why we need raise your hand.  If you think it's close enough to 9331, let's see what what the room feels like.  Okay and raise your hand if you feel the other way that this is too crazy for about mendelian genetics.  Well, it wasn't perfect 50/50 that's interesting.  So let's go figure this out.  So, it's your turn to start this first of all 9331. You said I'm going to do some division by 16.  So you're noticing here that 9/16 of those peas should come out green and round you got to add up all those things and then that's the denominator for the 9, right.  If there is a one-to-one ratio than 1/2 1 / 1 + 1 + things fit category a and the other half to category B, don't find expected counts for the four phenotypes. Let's see what we should have gotten.  It's so interesting you started by you like look internally if the data like is this a 9 to 1 ratio? Is this a 3 to 1 ratio? And then you started to talk about observed account?  Both are like the same thing sort of.  But it's the second logic that this framework uses actually.  Chicopee counts, you're still going.  Okay, I seen people near the front Brother P counts.  Hopefully you got the east.  100 total peace and if they could be fit  Taste bad. If a goodly fit mendelian genetics 9/16 of them should have come out whatever Round And Yellow.  Okay, and then hear the other numbers, so that's what you do. So that's what we expect. Don't round them. We love their precision.  How do you actually do this in our well? Here's one way to do it in our  You go create a chi-square test chi-square test. So what are the one first?  It wants a vector. That's why the sea is right here of what you actually observed.  Then the next thing I want is what probabilities are you expecting to get if there is a good fit between your data and mendelian genetics. Okay, so you can write these percentages here.  Okay, hit the button it spits things out so you can see it gives you the Chi Squared squared so disgusting.  It couldn't have come up with some way to types up this I guess anyhow, so that is our Chi Squared statistic. That's the thing we calculated before.  Okay, so observed counts the proportions and guess what it will go to the expected counts for you. But you just did it. Once it has the expected count. Then it will go find the chi-square statistic, which is the number that measures how weird your data were relative to what you were expecting to see if the Knoll is really true.  Okay, then it pops it down on the correct distribution here there four categories for the four phenotypes. So three of them can really have variability in the last one is sort of influenced by the whole thing. So it dropped it on chi-squared 3 and then it shaded to the right and it got this p-value and of course, I intentionally chose the observed values so that it was really close to .05.  Cool the room in opposite directions on what was going on.  So I guess I need to change it a little.  Cuz the room wasn't 50/50.  Figure out if I should move it up or down, okay.  Now you won't get to see the expected counts unless you go dig into this results.  Okay, currently it's just since there's nothing in front of it to capture the results when you run the test, it just print stuff out. But if you capture the results into a new variable, then you can only print out the results but find expected counts Nolan alternative hypotheses. The Knoll is not a list that all the proportions are the same blah blah blah. It's just a theory fits in the sudden. There's a good fit and the alternative is it something's wrong about the fit another frustrating thing here is if you decide to move to the alternative, which is not what we do here we stick with the no but if you decide to move to the alternative all you can clear it is something's weird about my population. I don't know which of the proportions aren't lining up correctly. If there's more than one that doesn't line up correctly. If all of them don't line up correctly, so that leaves you with that same.  Bad taste in your mouth like a Nova does something's different about the means. I don't know what I don't know which one.  But I just ran one test which is nice instead of hundreds of tests.  Now here's the picture of The observed and expected counts.  What's your brain? Say when it looks at that does it say they're different?  or the close enough for jazz  I don't know jazz.  Well, that's what I thought. This is a test has also right close enough for jazz, but just barely close enough for jazz .06 kind of jazz handy, but not super Jazz handy. Okay. So when can we what are those pesky conditions? I have to check in order to actually run all of this that no one ever really text cuz the world is a sloppy mess with statistics.  first thing  you better have a table of observed counts chi-square. Based on counts not proportions, although they're all related, but it's designed to work with the counts as a framework.  Next accounts that are filling your table should be independent of one another.  So usually if you just fill up the table by choosing random people in measuring whatever it is you care about them, like what month you were born in if your hockey player then this is fine.  And then finally the last ickiest won the expected count for each cell must be at least five.  This is not something about the observed bouncy expected.  So if you're going to have a big table of data and it's what you think is going to happen the expected counts, you need stuff to actually show up in life.  Just like when we two proportions you're going to go measure what percentage of people identifying some way if it's incredibly incredibly rare and your sample has none of those people is a very strange thing. You haven't really captured what you care about some is wrong about your sample size in the idea and all this. So here it's at least five other books will use a different number other books will say it's okay if a few cells or less than 5 but blah blah blah again rule of thumb that vaguely get you to the correct distribution of chi-squared usually all the time.  Okay, there we go. Now maybe you don't care about anything but video games, so I thought I'd show you this interesting example, we're not going to dig into it, but you can go look at it and your own some of you play Super Smash Brothers. They just released the fancy new Ultimate, right?  December 7th  Oh Mexico is ahead of schedule. America's behind same thing happened with Zelda.  Breath of the wild other place is got it before us so here is something from one of the old versions.  So the guy posted this video online of him playing Super Smash with these incredible moves that seemed in human.  And it has to be Tas to assisted speedrun or computer-generated whatever. It's the alternative idea here either. This guy can do these insane moves or was all done by computer. So someone looked at Wendy's insane moves were occurring in the video and they looked at the seconds or something.  I don't know.  Seconds digit tens digit in the seconds. Okay. So when do all these exciting things happened? So it's a person just sort of playing on their own these sort of amazing moves should just let it happen to randomly it. But if you're somehow fixing it to some computer that's doing all the moves then it may not show up equally random and all these like exciting things. So anyhow, you can go look at this and basically this one video right here, which was the crazy video when they went and ran some Chi Squared analysis and looked at when things were actually occurring and when they should have been occurring you get some crazy P value for the actual example of chi-square with Super Mario in Super Smash Brothers in the wild if you want to go read it, and now that you know about chi-square it will make more sense.  Okay. Now what else I don't just care about one population and comparing it.  Just some theoretical good Fitness idea.  You might care about more than one population and split it across some ideas on categorical variable.  So this is the other kind of chi-square test. So here we have three different kinds of rats.  A control group they got nothing.  A low-dose that got injected with something quite naughty.  And the hydros that got injected with lots of the naughtiness.  There are three populations. They're all different right now. What are you do with those in the control group? You're going to split it and look how many tumors got developed across some categorical variable in here. It's 0 1 and 2 plus  Is the categorical categorical variable levels?  Okay, so this is a two dimensional table.  As you can see, we now have more than one population. So there are lots of rows and we're splitting it across some idea before it was like the months.  Hockey players now it's the tumor development of rats so that very interesting. Naughty thing. They're injecting them with is something called pyro benzene.  one of the major components in cigarette smoke  ever wonder how they decide whether smoking causes cancer or not.  Well, you can inject rats with this stuff.  And see if it leads to cancer.  You can't really give people this stuff and run a trial on them something about ethics last time I checked.  So they took 230 rats they put some in each category for none lower high dose and they just kept pumping him full of all this stuff day after day and then after certain amount of time they stopped.  unlife them  and looked at tumor development and they're gonna live bodies.  And here's the table of data.  Now it's smoking has no relationship.  To the development of cancer.  You would expect to see similar kinds of patterns in the table.  It is it doesn't matter what row you're in cuz the roads are about pyro by bending level you would expect to see similar ratios, like the 74 to 521. You'd want to see something different or something similar in the next row. Another could be different numbers cuz you could have put more people in that group. They do put twice as many people you would be expecting something roughly like 74 * 205 * 2 and so on.  If there is some linkage between smoking and cancer development, which of the ideas along the sides of the table, then the table should not remain consistent As you move through the different rows.  Okay, so as you look at this.  Does your soul tell you that the rows are fundamentally different from each other or they just scalar multiples of one another?  Someone tell me about your soul.  No one has a soul. Go ahead.  the rose feel different why doesn't row to feel like a scaled version or an equivalent version of Row 1  Alright rain rot you okay why those different?  Okay, so is only 72 got the high-dose, but already 10.  And this one had even more rats in the low-dose, but it has fewer. So that's how you made your decision. Okay, great. So that's one way to do it. You can look at like the total counts here and see if it's sort of look similar. Are you need to scale this out by you know, whatever.  7280 that scale up ratio is but it actually doesn't go the right way at all. Okay.  Is it so weird in this data set?  But if we put all the rats ever through this you would think it would still be weird.  Can we move beyond the data and just claim it smoking and cancer have a relationship? That's what we want to figure out now.  Just like the hockey player data looked funny.  I know and all these other day two sets but are they funny enough like the mendelian genetics to make a conclusion to the larger population. So let's set up the Nolan alternative here movie super boring smoking had nothing to do with cancer.  Okay. So this is one way to write there is no association between the idea on one of the axis and the idea that makes up the other axis. Another way of saying that idea on one of the axis is independent of the ID on the other Association or independent you can use either they mean exactly the same thing.  Choose your favorite word are chosen now. Okay, that would be super exciting if there was some sort of Association if they were somehow dependent. So all the independent people you can use the word dependent in your alternative.  Now this is still a table of counts.  Surprise word is actually the appropriate tool. We just have to figure out what we would expect to see if we assume the null is true. We also need to figure out once we figured out who's expected counts how we going to go to the Chi Squared statistic. And what curve are we going to drop it down onto and Shay to the right?  So a lot of this is just me telling you these things because they're actually quite difficult to prove and take a lot of 181a and then you can go to hear you can understand what how this is all proven. So it's a long haul for this actually.  Okay, so here are the observed counts.  So if there's no if there's nothing going on here.  I would expect to see 63.3 in this cell.  The question is how to how do you figure that out? Well, you take the 80 rats in the control group.  And you need to divide those into bins zero cancer the one cancer in the two or more tumors, right?  Okay. So what you do is you say what what percentage of rats don't ever have tumors.  Are the question about the whole table? And you would say well here's this 182 out of 230. That's the way Dad which no tumors happen.  Okay. So what you do is you apply that rate to these at wraps right here.  And you would have just multiplying 80 by 182.  over 2:30  Okay, let's see. If you can find another one of these cells that I point out. Here is the one tumor and high dose.  See if you can figure out what that is for I just give you some formula.  Turn you into a machine. Are you already typing this into your calculator to have it do all the expected counts?  Yes.  You took a piece. In high-school. Didn't you? It ruined you it ruins everybody. You just learn how to hit buttons, right?  But you never like to think about anything. That's the problem.  Trust me. I was in the high school world for 10 years. I know how it works.  to get something  9.74. Is that what you got?  Did anyone get 9.74?  Free people think something. It must be true, right?  Oh that's after country can be wrong. Okay. Anyhow, there's any points 7/4. What are you do you say you take the 70 rats? They're all high-dose. They hear you're 70 rats and you figure out how many of them were going to be in this one to McCallum. Well, one tumor happens 32 out of 230 cases to apply that percentage on top of it.  And scale it by that factor right there.  Now maybe you've noticed already what you need to do here to get these take some cell that you care about. Maybe it's high-dose meeting one tumor and just look at the road total and the column total in / the table total.  Okay, so you guys memorize that but it makes more sense when you like to do a couple of examples and think about how one would come up with such a thing. But every time we did one of those calculations it was just row times column / table total.  now on the exam what I can do to stop calculator people as I can say you must  show me all the expected counts and explain how you got one of them. That's how you shut down calculator people.  And then I bring up the calculator and non calculator people fancy calculator calculator calculator for anything other than simple operations like + - x swearing and so on and that's another way to bring everybody into alignment if the social justice around the administration of the test is what matters now what do we do with this one? Save all the expected counts. All you do is you run through each cell. These are like the bins and there's a lot of these right and you just do observed - expected / expected when she Square the top to make sure that things are negative and positive canceling each other out.  So some across all sales now if there's margins written in you shouldn't do those.  That doesn't make any sense cuz those aren't actual data values.  And then you have to figure out what distribution you should throw this number down on.  Now here is something a little more complicated you suddenly have a two-dimensional tables to have some number of rows and some number of columns.  So what you want to do is take the number of rows and subtract 1 and take the number of columns and subtract 1 and multiply those two values.  Okay. So in this example, we have a 3 by 3 table with some added marginal nonsense. The data itself are in the 3 by 3 zone. So you do 2 * 2  that maybe want to know how to do this in our  how about that?  Prince let's just go to the computer by don't we  So we're still going to do the same thing as before with a chi-square test. But this time I have to build the two dimensional thing Matrix Nashville named. What are you do you put a big list of all the numbers that will be in the table?  70451 63 and so on right to hear the nine numbers now you have to tell it what size of a table you'd like to build. Okay from these nine numbers that could build a 1 by 9 table and 9 by 1 or 3 by 3.  If you owe if you allow integer numbers of rows.  What you think about non-integer Matrix row numbers. Are you going to use your numbers and go across the rose?  Like a typewriter or you going to go down the columns?  Like some language that does that what language does that?  What Excel?  What written language is go top bottom?  Japanese  does anyone else confirm Japanese?  Two people think something's true. Okay.  Okay. So now you're this Matrix. So all you do is you dump it into the chi-squared thing now, you don't need to specify the expected proportions here.  It can actually calculate those given what's going on in the margins believe it or not? Okay, so then I store the results in something called results.  and now you can go and print out those results and it will show you the result of our little test here now, you know, it's a great freedom but showing you that that's the 2 x 2 or 3 - 1 * 3 - 1  So if you look at the P value.  if smoking  and tumor development truly are independent.  NH not really is true. We got a result. That is very strange.  Okay.  It's basically a one out of a thousand event. So what's more likely?  There really is no association. We just got the craziest dataset ever.  Are there probably is some dependents in some linkage between the ideas on the two axes? You're probably going to move over.  To the dependence, but wait, what about those pesky conditions?  Can we even run a chi-square here?  The conditions are basically the same. I want to show you if you want to know what the expected counts are. The computer has them and since I store the results of the test in an object called results, I could pull out a cookie from it called expected and you can see all the things here. You're 9.7, right?  Look at that right there.  4.8  It's a little smaller than 5.  So the computer was actually trying to warn us on the previous slide. Look at this red text. I didn't type that approximation may be incorrect.  This distribution that you think of the chi-squared may not actually be perfectly a Chi Squared. So here are the same conditions that we needed before me just reiterating them. I remember it. Okay counts.  You need to actually of integers and a table. Okay, you need ideas to be independent. One of those counts have to be independent and finally expected counts greater than or equal to 5.  Okay, we got to stop.  Have a great day everyone.  San Diego "
