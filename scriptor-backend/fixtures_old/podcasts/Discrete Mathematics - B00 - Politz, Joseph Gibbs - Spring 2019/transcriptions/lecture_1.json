    "Full Transcript": "Let's get started. So I waited for an extra minute or so just cuz it's the first day but usually I'll start right at 9:20. I'll be introducing myself in a second grade math is about the math some of the math that we use in computer science, but I want to highlight two specific things that I want you to get out of this course, we want you to get out of this fine that we in a minute in these days. You are all seeing lots of systems programs algorithms miraculous answers. From Google translate driving directions to cars that drive themselves and and we trust them a lot. And so when we get answers from systems as computer scientist, it's useful to exercise some healthy technical skepticism about if those answers represent good answers to the problem. We're asking questions. We should ask the probe at if the answer to that problem is a good answer is going to be skeptical of the answers were getting and the argument that are leading us to those answers. So technical skepticism is going to be a big scene of the course something we want you to get out of it. Another thing that I want you to get out of it is ideas about communicating technical content you have done you are going to do or have done some example programming getting automated system problems.  It's useful to be able to think about that program not just in terms of the code. You wrote it working one time to be able to talk about it intended to happen and communicating those technical results say to customers to researchers to other students to your boss. All of those audiences require talking at a different level of abstraction and picking a different representation of the problem to talk about whether it's more related to impacting people's lives are more related to the technical details of getting something to work and the talking about a problem and work on technical communication. Those are two big themes that we're going to have in this and if you can have some skills and do something really successful for you.  So no one of the things that's going to happen in this lecture is you are going to not just hear from me, but you're going to talk to one another or we're going to be plenty of time for you to discuss. So I want to take a minute for you to introduce yourselves to one another. So I take a minute introduce yourself to the person next to in or maybe two or three of the people around you high introduce yourselves.  Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for taking that first instruction to heart. I'm glad you had a lot to say and you all can introduce you just met today as we talked through some problems. The next thing I want to do is introduce the the team of it. So this is the reason I've been saying we to call instructor. So there's myself my name is Joe politz politz.  I'm so where where there's two sections of this Forest is this one that I'm teaching now, and another one where the lectures right now and I are running them as one combined Force the same course stop all the same assignments on this has two different lecture section. So you can contact us by email with anything that's private sensitive needs to be handled in general. The best way to contact us is going to be through the board for the class. You can always post privately on Piazza and it's good to ask either privately or publicly on Piazza depending on when it's a question about homework or just in general, which is it includes.  Can I have your name and then just didn't what year and if I'm Marco? Carmosino? I'm a TA. I'm a PhD student here in actually finishing up this quarter. I did my  I did my PhD in theoretical computer science because an uncomfortable number of years ago. Now I took this class and it was this class at UMass and it was so exciting that I got trapped in a PhD in this material. So hopefully love enjoy the class some amount as much as I did.  Hello everyone. I'm Carlos. I'm a third-year undergraduate student.  Tell everyone I'm Maria. I'm a second-year undergrad students and I really love tc20 as well. Enjoy it as much as I could.  Hi everyone. My name is Herman. I'm a third-year computer science student and I love this great might I hope you all will enjoy this class as well.  Thank you all the staff as a lot and still be holding office hours to get help. And so any flexura section A few of them will be here. And when we have discussion where you're talking to the people around you on Bill also be available to answer questions in class. So incredibly grateful to the tremendous staff that we have introduced some of the logistics of what deadlines are going to look like in the course what homeworks going to look like in the course those kinds of things and then I want to dive into some content. We're going to talk about some material and notation to get started today. So the main thing the main things we need to know about the course or what is the work look like so in general you're going to be doing  I'm a little bit of preparation for lecture in lecture will have a pretty interactive lecture will where will I be asking questions and you'll be discussing three different kinds of homework. There's going to be and I'm going to talk about those on a calendar and a second that I'm going to keep using our warm-up three different kinds of assignment that will be doing that sort of have different flavors. So I'll talk about those in a second. We listen official addition that we are going to see if we get page numbers and things like that will use that version but you can use any Edition all the things that were going to be talking about are provided across the different Edition. So if you find it if we have an evening the term so get that on your calendar that Wednesday May 1st in the evening is going to be the one midterm for the classes 1 exam during it for there is a website.  Worksheet that you got today that has all the detailed information about how the classes graded and details of the syllabus and has links to just about everything everything that you need for the course that's a place where you can get the schedule for the course resources like the PDFs of the worksheets that we have from class and things like that. And then I'm getting help we're going to be using a service called where you get an invite for that Piazza for discussion. And then we have office hours and also their classes podcast so you can always access to lectures with audio and video after the lecture.  One thing we're going to do in this course, you see this little window in the upper right of my screen with the green arrow. It says multiple choice will be doing in class. But this is the first time you're seeing. This is we're going to be using Liquors in this class and so cold after clicker if you have a clicker, so it's like I mean, you don't have to have one-on-one to be clear. Like you're not missing any credit by not having one on day one or anything like that. I just want to see how many I'm about to get for this question. So I actually look so I'm going to check right now to make sure that I have the frequency set, right this room says that the frequencies ba but let me make sure that I'm I'm actually set correctly. I just realized that I made this class this morning and I don't want you to all of a sudden try to click in. There we go now run ba start this up.  Answer with your clicker is the question in the bottom left here, which is why would we use iclickers in class? Why would we do it?  And just make sure that you're seeing like a checkmark on your screen or some sort of feedback that you're thicker worked. It's a good time to double-check.  I want to reassure you the clicker policy for the chorus is such that if you're like missing something or something is misconfigured for a day or two. You're not going to lose lose a bunch of credit. I just want to give people a chance to try this out. Okay cool, and I'll show you the results for this question 20 people said divorce 100% attendance and lectures 16 said to make sure you're awake cool and see I see is actually why and beer would be sort of shallow reasons to do it. But see is actually a pretty good reason to do it. There's numerous studies in different stem classes. This work actually started out of people who teach physics but has now spread to lots of stem stem Majors showing pretty compelling evidence that students learn more if they do certain styles of answering questions and discussing with their peers in class. So we do it because they're sort of the preponderance of evidence that helps you learn and that's a good reason to do something.  Real talk about this other question that I have up or are you taking or do you plan to take math? 109 don't know why I would ask that why that would be on the slide?  Yeah, where you going to say? Yeah. Yeah, So Satisfied from still the same role in satisfying prerequisites, so I wouldn't want to see you take both use a place in your schedule that you don't need to use. I'm so just be aware that cst20 in math 109 are going to act as prerequisites in the same way me am I saying that right?  For CSE, so if you have a math if you have a math dependency, you might need math 109. If you're taking C A C class has either one of these could satisfy. So don't you don't need to double up there. Thanks, man.  So I want to talk a little bit about these three kinds of assignments I mentioned so I mentioned that they were going to be warm ups follow-ups and homework different kinds of assignments what the schedule is going to look like in the course for the first few weeks and I'm a I want to use that talk about how this is going to work this week. We're going to talk about but we're going to talk about a couple different things to do on Thursday. It says warm up one and that one is for responding to topic once the next week on Thursday. You're going to signment called warm up one that's about content from this week. Content from this week after warm up one then you'll have a homework homework 1 on the following Thursday.  Another assignment called follow-up one another assignment called follow up on three separate assignments that have to do with content from this week the homework and the follow and then 4 topic 2. There'll be a warm-up homework and a follow-up never topics.  And so these three things feel different roles. The idea is that the idea is that these warm ups are really for you to get your first practice with a topic that we taught the previous week. These are open to collaborating with anyone in the class. You can ask lots of public questions on Piazza about them. You don't you don't have to really worry about getting information from either a TA or for someone in the class that you weren't allowed to get when you're doing the warm-up assignment is to get first practice with that content. Then after you hand in the warm-up, which is due on Thursdays will have a recall homework and homework you can do you can do alone or you can do in Paris. You can't work outside of the pair or the partner that your homework  Cast of the staff and you cannot you have to work alone or with a partner on it.  Then there's a follow-up assignment where you work alone. You can't work in pairs. You have to work alone on this assignment questions privately and then these are the ones they're going to do the following Thursday. What's the warm-up gives you a chance to have lots of conversation and collaboration about the content figure out notation figure out vocabulary. The homework is a place where you can do some deep work. You can pick how you like to work with you would like to work alone or with a partner and really get into the content of this will be written homework reflects a lot of thinking that you do then the follow-up gives us a place to independently assess what you learned. Basically it's for you and us to check in that you understood what happened with that topic. The follow-ups is a nice individual test for yourself, especially when you think about preparing yourself for an exam for each week. There'll be this warm up.  Homework follow-up plan as the three things that we do for homework. The only exception to this is the first week because we don't have any topic 0 so we have an introductory assignment that's due this Friday and then we'll have a follow-up to it that into independent follow up to it. It's due next Thursday. I'm so the first weeks a little bit of an exception. Yeah.  Oh, so generally like the day after the last thing so warm up one will be posted on that will be due on Thursday. And then on Friday homework Friday morning homework, when will be posted then the next day they release it earlier, but that's what are the latest it'll get released and I'll give you the info for the warm-ups will be able to release all the answers and things like that. We had that information to go forward if you want to add anything about any other questions about this sort of schedule.  When are they due on Thursdays? So they'll always be these are due dates. So you can think of each of the things in blue things do every Thursday current Topic in a follow-up for the previous topic.  So something so you will it depends a little bit on the week if all the homework problems will be out while to warm up or not, but it should be a reasonable amount of work for the time that's listed for the spam. It won't be like if it's before only if we give it to you in 4 days.  What questions about this format?  All right, so I wanted to do one more thing to see you one more thing quick. Actually wow most  Okay, maybe I don't even need to say this.  Set alarm devices in class for a second, which is I was looking at what was on people's laptop screens that are open because all the people behind you are looking at what's up on your laptop screen all the time, right?  If you are sitting in with your laptop open, there's just like a whole cone of people behind you who because of the way human physiology work can't help but look at your screen.  Rite Aid, they literally can't help it there. I is going to go down there some number of times per minute. No matter how much they try and focus on this screen. That's a terrible thing. If your laptop screen or your tablet screen or whatever you have up has CSE Twain notes that you're taking or cst20 content on it. They're going to be like I should be. Oh, yeah cool right there going to be getting like to extremes worth of information about cst20. I may be a little distracting to their eye but not the end of the world and not taking them completely out of The Learning Experience. They're happy they're having so the Rollie like to have in my lectures is if you have a screen open, it has cst20 content on it. It's the slides for the day the notes for something that's related to CSE twenties lecture content for the day. If you want to have a screen open that does not have cst20 content on it. I understand.  Please sit in the back two rows because that limits the number of people whose attention is stolen by the screen you have up. So if you want to have some email that's not related to see if he 20 or whatever open on your screen and you want to be that so you want to be trying to do that multitasking. Please sit in the back two rooms. I don't understand that some people believe they can multitask personally. Sometimes I'm in a talk and think I'm multitasking and really I'm getting nothing done. I want to have my email open. If you want to do that. Just keep in mind that you are part of a big room that you're responsible for not stealing the attention of other people website. So so that's all I want to say about policy for the day unless there's any questions about policy in logistics before we go  Most things a lot of detail in the website so you can look there for questions about specific reading questions and specific policy questions questions before we dive into content for the day.  Justice questions  Let's get started.  So the worksheet you have one side of it has a bunch of notation examples and the other side has a specific example. We're going to be working through today notation examples are useful because they're going to be a bunch of pieces of notation. We use in the first few weeks and discovers a bunch of them. But the particular is this Netflix example, so it's the example with the table that says fire and Moana and bird box.  And I want to talk about Netflix for a minute. So I'm in Netflix and in tons of systems where you either what continent to read content any system that has a bunch of content in a bunch of users and tries to recommend things to users. There's an interesting question of what information is used to recommend new content to existing users has come out. Sometimes they show up at the top of my Netflix speed and sometimes they don't know how does Netflix make the decision but what things should appear high in my recommendations on what things should  And there's a couple of answers for this. We're going to explore one answer today. So what precisely which is Netflix can look at my viewing history or somehow figure out what movie is don't like right? Maybe I explicitly voted on some of them like a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, right? Or maybe it just knows that I stopped in the middle of watching something and so I probably didn't like that but somehow Netflix knows something about the movies. I like and don't like Netflix has this information for all of the users that use Netflix for all of the Netflix and Netflix can ask questions. Like how similar are my preferences to someone else's preferences and are there movies that they have watched that I haven't.  That might be good to recommend to me if we have very similar preferences what are very different preferences and they like a new movie? Maybe that's not a good movie to calculating something about her defining something about the similarity of preferences between users can be one way to start making recommendations the matches what we do socially right kind of movies that my friends watch. So I'm going to take their recommendations for new movies right way to build recommendation system is to talk about similarities and preferences.  So what we have on the worksheet is this table where we listed for people or P1 for P4 neither users of Netflix and for each of three movies Netflix has some information about their preferences. We're here and asked me and they didn't like it a. Means that they didn't have no preference in a check means that they liked it.  No, we want to take these things and represent them.  You want to take these things and represent them mathematically somehow because one of the things we're going to do is try and work with these things actually do calculations not just texting exes. And so is a definition of each of these rows as a 3-2. So it's 3 to fold here is his order collection of three different numbers. It happens. All these numbers are -1 zeros and ones.  For all of these examples of the X to a negative 1 0 in the check to a one in each row and that gives us for free to be first three rows. I'm so just take a minute actually a couple seconds and what should be in the Bottom Road just make sure we all agree on this bottom row. Can I take a second write that down just confirm with your neighbor for a second just make sure we agree on the notation here.  So this bottom one is going to be you can shout it out if you want. What's the first value?  Thanks I can value.  Better Valu, all right, so we can turn checks nx's it's a number.  So now that we have this information about but we can both think of it as a question for you which one of the first three people of P1 P2 P3 has movie preference is most similar to P4 want to know which one of these people do you think has the most similar preferences to be for the most similar preferences to be for?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, cool, so we got some clothes for this I'm not going to show them just yet I want to go on and talk a little bit more about some of these some of these pieces so on the sheet after after this question on the sheets there's a couple of different definitions of ways that we might talk about talk about defining this preference I'm curious for the answer you gave how did you decide things were related to one another how did you decide that the person who voted for head preference is similar to P4? It was your decision like yeah.  So you said the least far away look at all the values in the columns and said something about least far away from P4 other ways other words we can use our vocabulary and definitions.  So you did some counting. So you said you you would put numbers to this idea of distance. You said the difference between each the values of going to be subtracted somehow or out of the Muppets and calculations other ideas for talking about how you know, this preference. Yeah.  So you're giving another person more precise description of this idea of distance, which is you're saying like an accident. Are closer than an X and a check, right? And so that's a nice English description maybe of this idea that you can count -2 instead of minus 1 is written English description about idea.  Yeah.  You looking you use that you were sort of counting up how many times they exactly agreed right? So for every time they either both had an ax both had a check and see exactly Dreamin talk about this comparison, right? None of these suggestions that have been made right or wrong. Obviously, they might match some of our intuitions in some cases. They might be you give us surprising results in other cases and we could try and turn all of these ideas into either a mathematical expression to computer it or a program that calculates what I want to do to work with these definitions a little bit is talk about two of these definitions that we could use for talking about how close to people's preferences are starting to work through to definition and see the definitions have some interesting different properties.  So let's talk about calculating the first notion of distance that we have for this visit a function definition of a function named D1.  Do you want takes in a tuple of X1 up to XM and a tuple of y1 up to YN and it calculates maximum of the absolute value of the differences of all of those of all those numbers taking them index by index.  So this is sound something like counting differences, but then there's this maximum applied, right? So there's something going on there about the index by index or element by element differences looking at the columns and then there's a couple other definitions just to make sure that we've been precise here, which is we say let N be a positive integer, which means that we're going to have both of these two poles of the same length example, everything is a 3 Tuple right now and working streaming the problem just say that all of the x's and y's are like the x's and y's we saw an example they come from this at negative 1 0 1  This is the kind of definition of a kind of definition will be writing in this course. I just wanted to use all the words that are given. I'm in English definition so that we get used to saying these things out loud in class.  What talk about calculating sd1 function on a P4 and the 204 P1. I'm actually want to give you just a minute to think about this and talk about calculating this out to see what you'll get for an answer on the p12 pull around and answer any questions you have so far.  See if people are people.  All right, so I want to do this one do this one on the board for you just to make sure that we sort of these pieces are being used on the P4 to fall was.  Looking at this sheet. We said P4 was going to be 0 negative 1 + 1 + P one is going to be negative 1 0 and 1.  So that means x 1 is 0 x 2 is -1 x 3 is 1 y -1 Y 2 is 0 y 3 is one we want to talk about all of those all the differences between us and an absolute value them. So we're going to have 0 - -1 absolute value.  -1 - 0 absolute value + 1 - 1 - 1 absolute value  Those are the three results of subtracting the pairwise elements. So we end up with a 1 + -1.  And a zero and take the max of those three things.  And that's equal to one.  Don't agree with the how I got to that answer from these pieces. They make a mistakes.  RT 1 and p 4 swapped  C1 and C4 swap soapy 1 MP4 swaps a little bit more about what you mean.  CU so4 P1 when I look at the P1 row, I see an Icee -1 for the first thing in the tubule for X1 and I have that is the second argument. So I think that I have this set up according to the problem. It's good to check soapy one has an X Under Fire that corresponds to the negative one of the beginning of P1 the second argument to D1. So those should be through by 3. So I think I think I haven't matched up.  Interesting interesting does order matter. So there's going to be lots of lots of questions like that. That's right, like swapping something a reordering something. Let me give this answer to order function arguments appear in matters may be the case that something special about D1 makes it so we get the same answers for different argument orders and that would be special about do you want but definitely the argument order matters for functions and definitely the stupid order matters for matching the problem we're talking about where each of these numbers represents a specific specific movie right to build order definitely matters, and then we could talk about how special D1 is or how special this problem is that order a we can get the same answers for different orders.  This produces a 100 for D1 we get a one-way get two of these elements that are one part. One of one element that is exactly the same by cuz at the 1120 lemax those and we get one. So this calculation of distance is giving us the biggest disagreement between these two people that what this is calculating is the largest disagreement that they had by this measure of subtracting subtracting the numbers from one another  So with that in mind, I want you to apply this to get the answers for P4 mp2 and MP4 MP3. So when you're ready the answers that are from the answers that are here.  Feel free to feel free to be discussing as you're doing this right now. Sometimes I'll ask you to answer on your own before discussing. But for this one, I just want you to know.  Okay, I'm going to close the clicker question in about 10 seconds.  3 2 1  So given the understanding that we have at this is calculating the maximum disagreements and also just sort of doing out the calculation and doing out the max calculation. We can see and kind of confirm the dancers hear that both of these end up being it too. If we wanted to explain this in terms of this Max disagree. We were talking about we can see that in the Moana call him there is definitely a disagreement between P4 and both P2 and P3. We can see the two there. And since we're Mac since we're doing a maximum see that the sort of hangs together. Big disagreement.  So this is kind of interesting on a does it does support the argument that you all made so overwhelmingly you all is more similar to P4 then P2 or P3 overwhelmingly. So if this is a measure of distance MP3 or further than P1 nice if it makes sense that the distance from P2 and P3 is the same way for both of the second answers. We got a tattoo.  No, I don't know looking at this. I don't know if I agree or not. It's not clear for me immediately if people or should be closer to one of P2 and P3.  Is there one of those empty for seems like it's closer to which one which one?  T3 yp3 yp3  So you're saying look if we go back to just this original tableview right on there's a big disagreement between P4 in P2 on bird box, right? And that disagreement doesn't exist between T4 and T3 preference in the box, So let's talk about another way. We can talk that we measure this another way that we could talk about relationship. Took me to MP3.  And that's this interesting calculation. We were in here. So we've deployed to finding another function called D2D to also takes the same in terms of how we call it takes to two bowls of length. And then what it does is it summing up the difference of the squares of the elements and then taking a square root of the end something up the difference of the squares of the elements and taking a square root at the end.  Let's take a minute and try and calculate this and then I'll do it together. Just after giving you a couple seconds to get started on it. I really want you when I prompt you to get started on something. I really want you to start writing start thinking about what you'd write down. Sometimes I will go through it all in the board. Sometimes I won't but you starting to write it down make a whole bunch of things happen in your head that are useful before you see me do some so I try to take a couple seconds and start this on your own.  Okay, so I'm going to start working through this. I just want to make sure we get to talk about this in a consequence of it by the end of class. But I hope you got started on it. Again. We have the same the same startup as we did for the last one that I wrote out where we're matching.  These different values to how they appear.  This is a P4 and P1.  And what we're going to do is this time, we're not just going to take the max of them. We're going to square the individual answers square root.  So what do we get? Here we go again. We get there 0 - -1 thus -1 - 0 + a 0  So this turns out to be what we get a 1 + 1 + 0 is really the result of doing squared + -1 squared + 1 + 1 + 0 is the sum and then we take the square root of that whole thing is the answer to this answer for adding all this up. I think I made a mistake in the calculation or step in the calculation where I skip something or wasn't clear. Yeah.  Yeah.  Take the sum of everything. Yeah, so  at the square at first yasso way to something something go wrong in this wearing stuff. Only be a little more explicit right weed is 0 - -1 * -1 - 0 squared + 0 squared - 1 squared + -1 for those three pieces. Then we added them up 1 + 1 + 0 ended up being too. I took the square root of that.  The other steps that ice caps are wearing clear.  I'm asking this particular because there may be lectures where I intentionally make a mistake to try and illustrate something interesting and they're also maybe lectures where I accidentally make a mistake and by design it is going to be very hard for you to tell the difference. So I want you to be calling the steaks out to me. I do this when I program live in programming courses and I'm going to do it when I do math live in this course, I want you to be on the lookout for places where my descriptions on clear on making mistakes. I believe I think that this is the square root of this justifies why a little bit just to get a holistic View and that'll be for the day. So we had one too and two for these two calculations. We got the \u221a to hear for p 1 p 4 and P 1  For P4 in P2. Well, we have in the fire column. We did a 1 squared in the let's see in the Moana call him when you get a 2 squared.  And in the bird box call him. We also get a two squared.  So this ends up being we had all those upsets 1 + 4 + 4 is 9 we'd end up getting the square root of 9, which is equal to 3.  For the last one we get a one squared from the from the fire column a two squared from the Moana column.  And a 0 squared from the bird box on this is capturing something that bothered us before which is that we didn't distinguish between to mp3s difference in opinion about Bird Box.  So these are up to five and this will give us the square root of 5 is an answer.  And we need to understand that the \u221a 5 is less than 3 but this does tell her.  UC San Diego podcast "
