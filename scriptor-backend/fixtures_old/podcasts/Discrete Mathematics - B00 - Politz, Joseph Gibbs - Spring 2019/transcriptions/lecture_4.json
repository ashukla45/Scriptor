    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Alright, let's get started.  There we go.  I got to see you all again. Cuz I forgot to tell you last Monday that I was going to be out for the rest of the week. Sorry for the surprise. I was presenting some work and just gone for 2 days. So although I don't have any other travel planned this better be here every lecture for the rest of the quarter or where you left off on Friday and what we've been talking about or what we started talking about on Friday is different ways to represent number so we talked about this idea of doing base expansion and representing numbers in different bases base 10 being the one we are used to the most often faced to being the one that computers use quite a bit but understanding the many different faces.  So today we're going to talk about some more ways of representing integers and in fact, we're going to talk about representing non integer numbers to and the ways we talked about today or going to specifically form some of how this happens inside a computer and there's two kinds of office hours for the information on the website and its assignments go out how to get health in various ways, but the two kinds of office hours so you can come whenever you want multiple students can come in and ask questions and we're just there in a few days are there in the Tudors are there to answer questions if you want some kind of specific help maybe you didn't understand the question on the homework and you want to go over that you can schedule  as as the course progresses, but I wanted to be clear that there's these two kinds of office hours we have for the course and the ones you see schedule on the calendar and necessarily the only way is to  any questions either from last week or that you want to ask before we before we dive in for the day since you haven't seen me in a week.  Yeah.  I was good at it soon as I programming languages and compilers Conference. So I met some people I haven't met before who build compilers that are like the thing that makes JavaScript run in your web browser. I'm so fun to talk to them just take a second. And what I want you to do is think about what the base expansion based on the definition. We do not using anything but I just paid them what we did last week. What's the base 2 expansion of 20 in base ten?  This up. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. I just want to make sure you use start the problem on your own before I brought it.  the number 20 in base 10 converted to base to number 20 in base 10 converted to base 2  I see some people holding up fingers in specific patterns indicating what they think it is this very great difference in the last week. I might one way I made you this and I have a number like 20 where I can where I just sort of these lights a little better for you where I can sort of tell that 28. Well, it's 16 + 4 which are both powers of two men. So maybe I can start thinking about the ones place the tooz place before is placed its place and so on in the base to representation of Step by Step division at the base and keeping track of the remainder so we can talk about this.  Time we divide 20 by to we get 10 with a 0 remainder. Then we can divide by 2. Again. We can divide that by two we get one with a zero remainder in dividing with one remainder. And then these digits are in increasing position order the coefficients. We should use for the base 2 expansion expansion way up here zero zero one zero one of these different positions are this is the ones place the tooz place before is the Apes in the 16th. And if we talked about calculating this out 1 1 * 16 + 1 * 4 + 20  Big questions about this are other ways people thought about this before we go on talking about changing this representation a little bit to represent computer.  They make any mistakes.  So I want to go on to talking about this definition. That's at the top of the worksheet now.  When I did this I just now for you and maybe what you did on your worksheet when you did it is you just used as many as many coefficients as you needed to and stop when you got to the 16th place cuz there's a 1 in the most significant place. In fact, the definition from last week said that you couldn't have a zero as the first digit in order in one of these representations part of the definition for last week and we ended up with five coefficients because that's how many coefficients we needed to represent 60 computers work a little differently than this computer is 10 to store fixed sized representations of values and numbers.  Computers are going to use the same amount of space to store a number like one as they would just or a number like a billion. They won't use a different number of bits to store those two numbers and glossing over a few details here, but for the common case of representing integers that are in the range of billions and Below true that a computer fixed with representation of numbers efficient says we need always with a 1 in the most significant we fix some size. We say we're going to represent all the numbers we can with 8011 coefficients are 16-0 in one coefficients R32. Some number of coefficients are going to be used and not I will represent numbers. So the definition of your worksheet says we are going to be expansions of numbers.  We pick a fixed with upfront as part of the definition and then say that we're going to represent numbers with that many digits always.  As a as a question for you, but I want to ask instead of just representing 20 with for the number of number of coefficients. We use to represent 20, which of these were.  So which of these are possible for writing the number 20?  I never asked you to this one.  Just looking at answers coming in right now.  Okay 5 4 3 2 1.  Okay, so we saw in the last lie, when I did it out that we needed at least five digits to represent plenty. We needed that 16 place to represent 20. We can always add more leading zeros and get something that represents the same number. So A and B both have enough patience to represent 20 both have enough finery coefficients represent, but I see doesn't work.  Just got interesting. That means we're a little bit limited depending on what width we pick and what number is can be represented here.  The one question I have for you is that we just expressed some kind of I just expressed some kind of a constraint that there's going to be some numbers we can't represent here. So take a minute. I want you to talk about what constraint ought to go in that blank to capture this idea that I just said about not being able to represent some numbers. Once we've chosen with what constraints constraints on and make sense here to capture that constraint.  Feel free to talk about it.  I'm just going to let people talk for about 10 10 15 seconds.  All right. There was some ham so go ahead with suggestions you both raise your hand.  Maybe it has something to do with the law or something to do with an exponent. I'll call you in a second.  Beautiful power W. So I just sort of the inverse of a logarithm using exponents.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so this should be e to the power w.  What's the time?  I think the let me say when you come back to log in just a second.  We don't want him to be equal to the strength of the express. Is it an ought to be less than to the W right? So let me say this but instead and is less than b let me come back to this. We might be able to express this thing here, right? We might be able to say something like really Express with the upper bound on an is without without resorting to hear. These are all integers. So it's very sort of crisps to express and is less than  This constrains us once we fixed a with W. We're only going to be able to represent numbers that are those the numbers that were going to be able to fit in.  Consequences for us when we think about programming because it means that once we picked a fixed with representation. We can't actually represent all the numbers we might want to represent. It's a limitation. Another question I have is binary as the special case with base to on Friday. And now we introduce fixed with binary leaving with unconstrained so we can pick width represents a really big numbers. If we want to are there any numbers that can be represented by fixed with that can't be represented by a regular binary numbers that can be represented by a discussion about it.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick in again with the results of thinking about it. Think about this and talking about it.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, does someone want to give their answer and a little bit of reasoning for why they picked the answer they did.  Yeah, so there's going to be a lot of numbers we want to talk about that can't be represented by either of these representations so far. We can represent the number one half for example, right. Neither of these representation can give us one half the questions asking something a little bit different. Let me just make sure I restate the question. We're looking for something that can be represented in fixed with binary that cannot regular binary.  Interesting interesting. So let me let me go find us some more by binary and fixed with binary what I mean is the definition from Friday with base 2 and a definition from today with base too and we can definitely design something about the difference between these definition what I mean is base expansion from Friday the 6th with basic Mansion for today.  Interesting cuz I'm going to say again right now in the definition of fixed with binary and binary from Friday. We can't represent negative numbers. We can't represent 1/2 so we can't represent those numbers in either one without an extension. Yeah.  I understand Siri thing in fixed with we can represent zero and in what we learned on Friday. We can't represent zero and there's it. It has to do with the fixedness and you're not allowed to just write 0 in what we learn on Friday other answers other answers.  Yeah, that's really interesting. So we need to pull it that would mean that we need to pull up the definition from Friday, which is really interesting because I don't think I have the PDF open on my computer right now. Let's see if it's in my recent files perfect. And so we can zoom in on this definition and there we go. Okay, so this wasn't from rosin zeros are concerned about leading zeros in here.  The really good question, right?  Yeah.  Woohoo! So sheer down here. We have this constraint the most significant digits of the most significant coefficient is a k - 1 and it says that the most significant coefficient cannot be so in fact, the question is amazing, right if we go back to the definition and try and put a number that has a leading zero that can represent something with a leading zero. We can't represent something that's just all zeros. In fact, we can't do that. So the definition from Friday doesn't zero definition for fix zero at least one number that can be represented.  Are there any more are there any others other than zero that could be represented by the binary from Friday?  Heather's  Interesting to think about like how would you argue one way or another here, but I can't think of a counterexample right now. So it must be true.  How do you are you I'm wearing other about that.  so one argument I make  So we'll talk about what you're describing sounds want to dive into in today's lecture. That's that's the direction we could going. I'm going to make him more high-level argument in binary from Friday.  Then we have a number that has a bunch of coefficients in it and has some weeds K because we already have the number represented in binary which means it has some with K. And as long as there's no other constraints imposed by fixed with on that then we'll be able to represent those numbers from binary and fix with as long as there's no more constraints. There are binary from Friday and constraints on that we had today but this is really the only extra constraint. This is the constraint we dropped is enforcing that there's no leading zero we drop that constraint out of this idea of with there's really only one number that we got out of this now we can represent zero.  Argument for this sort of telling you this because I don't want to get into a proof strategies we need right now.  That's a really interesting question. So the question is why why do we have this constraint that we didn't leading leading zero?  It's not necessary to represent the number so it seems like extra information. So that's one answer other other reasons. Why it why don't ya go for I'm just going to go to you first.  So extra information arguments a to space we can talk about saving space on the pager saving space in our brains.  So now you're saying is if we are disallow leading zeros, then there's only one way to represent each number interesting to think about if that's true enough, but that could be making sure there's not multiple ways to represent the same number.  Interesting. So you're saying without that constraint we do have infinite leading zero. So since the definition forces us to talk about some K. That's some some positive integer. We're sort of forced to commit to a cell number if it's actually an integer because we can we can we are forced into definition to choose some integer the really neat idea and you're right that both of these definitions have this idea that you could I keep stacking things out in front larger number.  Does a force algorithms terminate depends on the algorithm I think so it would be hard to say without looking at a specific algorithm because if it depended on the zeros in some way maybe but it would depend on the algorithm. I think that the uniqueness is is probably the main motivation right we have we can only speculate on someone else's goals for giving us strength on it. But uniqueness of representation in a sort of zeros in front of them and in base 10 News live exactly one way that we typically write each number in base ten. It doesn't have any leading zeros and things like that. It opens up to representing more numbers and makes it clear that zero is something we want to accommodate representation.  Just Energy and start talking about representation of  actually, what's  let's take one.  Look at the worksheet for a second. I just want to take one second. Never you feel this all in I just want you someone to tell me what we would what should be filled in for these three boxes. And what's going to be different about them before before I go on so just just hands what's going to be different about the first box where it says with 10 in the second box where it says with 7. Tell me what just tell me the difference between those so we all know what it should be before we going.  So both of these are going to have some number of leading zeros and in the box with with and there's going to be more leading zeros and then the one with with 10 with a five leading zeros.  The next I want to talk about representing numbers that aren't just integers a bunch of you seem to even be starting to suggest some ideas for numbers that aren't Just Energy has four numbers that could be some of you talked about the negative integers, which is kind of real numbers that are in between dreams represent fractional values and so are non whole values. So we have this definition here instead of just having one wins. W we have two words with w and one refers to a bunch of exponents and coefficients the number of coefficients before a decimal point and another refers to the number of coefficients after a decimal point and so it can be a little bit tricky to spot in this representation Quizlet. Hiding. Here's all the stuff. That's before the. And here's all the stuff after the  So the. Is in between the A's in the seas.  And so what is this represent? What is this representation saying so it's not necessarily just any number of digits that we want. So we're staying in this domain of being fixed in the number of digits were going to use to represent things and what it's saying is the approximation we build up the approximation. We build up looks very similar for the first half. So this part  Looks just like what we had four fixed with a whole number representation, but then there's a part where we start using these other indices the efficient and we start using negative negative exponents.  Genesis 2 blanks these two blanks. So the first blank is somewhat similar to the the blank that we had for representing things in fixed with expansions for whole numbers. So that should be something tells us how big could possibly be with this representation because we're going to be constrained in what numbers we can represent here. And then there's an interesting funniness in this definition compared to what we had before instead of writing equals between X and this big some right before we were equals and it has a big sum is greater than I want you to just talk about this definition for a second maybe 30 seconds and come up with any questions you have about it so far. We're going to use it to do some specific things.  So what questions do you have about this definition before we go on?  Talk talk talk.  Yes.  Navigate to my home.  alright, so  what are some questions you came up with by looking at this definition some questions or interesting observations you came up with.  I guess like the greater than bit. It's like if you can't.  There's no point or something like more information behind.  So you're saying you're saying something about this greater than equals means There's a constraint in some direction approximating this number.  That's interesting. So your comment is let's say we had something like you said 8.3 and we could imagine adding a digit here. Right? So let's just think about base 10 write decimal that were used to and what it might mean under this under the situation you're adding another digit here can never take away make a number smaller if we would have zero there and keep being the same representing the same number 1 2 3 it would be larger, but there's something about  So the observation I want to just live from what you said it since we have a fixed amount of decimal space, right? So in this example 8.3 with one decimal digit and there's no possible way. We can represent 8.3 to hear and something about this representation seems to be choosing we're going to under approximate approximate approximation an approximation From Below. It's always smaller if we increase the width other questions or observations about this about this definition.  definition  whew interesting all the sea terms if you add them together should be less than one that's enough. That's an interesting observation. We can never take the stuff after a decimal point in a base 10 number and just talked about that being larger than one of those digits light up to something less than one observation. So the seas are going to have that property another hand.  There's a whole lot of numbers you can represent right so any with represent.  Yeah, so there's this questions about what numbers we can and can't represent. There's a way we could get we could spend almost too much time on dancing like cool numbers that are hard to represent. But I want to make the point that fix witness makes it so there's a whole bunch we can't represent once we fix up with because we're going to run into some challenges there.  all the way to  interesting, Yeah, so tell me that but you said you picked W is equal to 2.  W Prime equals to 0  My wife I think you mean it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, so let me make a couple comments here. So just just so imprecise with the definition. We're not based on definition. We're not allowed to take zero cuz it says the W&W prime or positive integers less it take this when we could also pick that C1 is equal to either 1 or 0 0 we get something like three fits this definition.  Right. Is that what you're making up here would help with that appear in this blank constraint would help appear?  Similar to the constraint from our other fixed with representation if we fixed it with how big can the number get. How big can the number get?  prefix W&W Prime  VW Beetle not bigger. It's like that's like the same thing as we had in the last definition. Yeah.  maybe the W + 1  access less than b to the W that sounds like the sum of all of those see coefficients x b to the beat of the exponent won't be more than one we had before one below as an integer.  Wait, what will never have an extra gets up there? So distance trains, you're the issue you pointed out we're not going to be able to stay like four five six seven. Those are all okay rep represent their constraint. You want them? Yeah.  So maybe we can say it at state of the something related to sea is going to be a limit here. I'm wary of CW Prime cuz that sounds like it could actually be kind of your number because he's could be like positive coefficient of putting this is a reason we could make it a little more precise by saying something about W pregnant.  This thing so, all right. So let's try some examples and maybe it'll help us figure out what we mean by this constraint here to numbers. Let's try representing 3.75 and on your worksheet. It makes it more specific with integer part with two and fractional part with 8. Let's talk about 3 representing 3.75% of 0.1.  time to work on 3.750 point one work on both of these for a minute and then we'll do them will do them together up here if you want to go around and answer any questions, so except  All right. So let's talk about these together for a minute. I'm in the 0.11 kind of interesting when we start trying to figure out what to put in there. So we have the way of the integer part in the decimal part to consider similar rules to what we've done before we need in the ones place to add up to 3. So won the major part of this as a whole number part of this but we need to start thinking about reciprocals of two of powers of 2, we want to add up to get to this number just like we have the ones place in the tooth place. What we start to have here is the 1/2 place in the 1/4 place in the 1/8 place. That's what those negative exponents. Give us is we can get there exactly.  And a quarter that adds up exactly 2.75.  Definition of prompt on the worksheet says a fractional part with 8 fractional part with ink and sew in the fractional definitions.  The zeros that are trailing are the ones that don't add any meaning or any extra information to the number whereas in zeros that are leading are the ones that don't have any information.  What's in the denominators depends on the basic app YouTube?  So this is 2 to the zero two to the one to the negative 1/2 to the negative 2 to the negative 3 and that'll typically be the saying right before the point.  What happens if we shift the decimal around? I'm not going to answer that directly multiplying things. So we know that we have zero before the decimal point surf again two numbers in 1/8 numbers after the decimal point to start thinking about this is real number where represent a larger than the approximation. What's a real number to be larger than the approximation to come up with? So should we add a house?  Should we add a half if we want the real number? We're representing to be larger than this approximation.  If we put one here, then the number that we aren't we end up representing here is going to be at least 1/2 because it is observation it then following digits can only add more to this so we shouldn't use a one here because we already be larger and part of what we're trying to do is end up under approximating a number worth again. We shouldn't use the force because then we'd over approximate the number that would be .25 that's already larger than point one.  One that's a .125. So that's already larger interesting 16.06 to 1/16 is less than 1/10. So this is the first digit for the first coefficient that we can add that doesn't break the constraint that we end up larger than x  the first coefficient where it's safe to add it and we don't end up with something larger than x  so here it seems like maybe it's a reasonable to put here and start talking about extending this more and more.  There's .625. The next number is going to be a 1 / 32.  1/32 should we add this position? Will that put us over at 10?  Yeah.  Why why can't why is it? Okay.  We could add it to this point six number that we have so far without going out without over approximating we could also think of that as being over 32 from the 1/16 + 1/32 is what we've been here that 3/32 and 3/32 meter larger. So this is also okay to add onto a 1/64 / 64 thinking we're doing before this is going to be 6 / 64 is contributed from these two.  3/32 and then numerator denominator by 2.77 over 64 so we can't do the 64 is please.  So we can we can work this out to the last few digits. We can keep doing what we're doing for the last few digits.  I don't want to be before doing any arithmetic for this.  Are we going to represent 1.1 exactly know it doesn't work out exactly here is some under approximation some number that's less than 0.1 and there's something interesting about how much it is less than what the relationship is between this number in point one. There's actually another constraint. I want to talk about here without doing a rhythmic. I just don't want to use the last 2 minutes of class on it. But if we go back to our definition, there's actually something that we want to constrain about how far off we don't want to just pick any number that smaller and we succeeded.  Send to clarify because X is larger than the decimal 0 and then we have a good approximation. We are in this approximation. It's a one way to talk about this. I'm just going to give this definition is that we could always fix. So I'm just going to call it the approximation and what it what I mean by the approximation is whole expression on the right hand side of the greater than equal.  the error here is  Error that we could fix by using no more than the next by no more than the next.  whoops W Prime minus one  sandiego.edu "
