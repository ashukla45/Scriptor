    "Full Transcript": "listening to a podcast  Okay, let's get started. So on Wednesday we talked about this new idea of predicates that let us extend the kind of logical statements. We could make two values from interesting domains other than true true and false. So we looked at some predicate over numbers and all of them. We defined with these fixed-length tables. So the examples for colors and for the compliment representations all had fixed size tables or a fixed number of elements in the domain and today. I want to explore predicate swear. That's not the case because there's lots of times where will have a number of elements that we can't just write down in a fixed size table will get a bunch of practice with the quantifiers doing this because most of the interesting things we want to say about credit GIF often involves existential and Universal statements.  Two applications of using these kinds of products. I do want to take a minute to do a different kind of quick announcement to specific thing in general. I want to remind everybody that you do have to type your homework week we deduct if you hand write your homework and take a picture and hand it in and in the second homework, there is a problem that asks you to draw some to design a logic circuit picture that is generated digitally not hand drawn up. This is actually think this is an important point for the course most scientific communication happens through typeset work and work. So it's useful for you to just like develop the skills to build these things up his type that document. So there's some nice images on Wikipedia.  Navigate to Anza lures XRS, and they're all free they're all Creative Commons license. So you can copy paste them and use them. However, you want another, we put out the aazah post after we finish grading assignments and give information about common mistakes and about things that we want you to be paying attention to in general because that's a lot of how we grade things that you need to know so that you don't miss format things or do things in ways were asking you to not do them. And I want to make a Wii release solutions for all the assignments and the solutions are not the solutions are the kind of writing. So we don't we really do not want answers in this class. Obviously, we don't want answers that are like just a number with no calculations or justification, but I also  If there's no English in an answer and there's just a sequence of mathematical statements, I as the reader have no idea what the claim being made it is or what the conclusion of that argument is. It's not an argument is actually just maybe five mathematical facts in a row. So if you skill that we want you to develop in this class is a skill of communication and communication is more than writing a sequence of correct mathematical statement that is not communication. It's only part of an accurate communication about a problem Solutions. You'll see that we say things like using the definition of homework Marion binary expansion calling out that if you were to look at this calculation that's happening in part. You should refer to a particular definition for that to make sense. If we just rode out this calculation who-knows-what definition. We're referring to use of one of the other definition. So we're always careful in our solutions to be specific.  Definitions were using before introducing any calculations with you. If you're doing any kind of scientific writing or any kind of communication like with your team, you can't just send the math or code that has to be some contacts about why you did that math or why you produce that code. So this is what we're looking for looking for justification that ties and calculations. You do back to the problem statement under the definition you use  So with that I want to get started for the day. I'm just as a reminder that a second home works out and is due Monday night. So then again there will be the next warm up in a follow-up to next Thursday. But the thing you should be focusing on right now is the homework on Monday night.  I'm so going back to predicate. So we Define predicate on Wednesday as functions that take an element from a given domain and map it to or producer value. That's true or false. I'm so they're true or false producing functions. And on Wednesday. We Define the tables but there are many interesting that work over domains that don't fit in a size table last row in this table. This table keeps going we could always talk about having another number or another a bit string or another sequence of ones and zeroes that keeps getting longer and represents. Maybe the next number in sequence.  And so I have much like we had on Wednesday written in each of the predicate that were interpreting these in their base 2 expansion not a fixed with space expansion just their base 2 expansion in Ensign definition of the first first question. I want to ask her first thing. I want to fill in and talk about here is what how should we describe the domain? What is the domain of these products talked about this? How should we describe it? What's the domain of these products? What's what should we say if I asked you to write down the domain?  What are some thoughts on how would I describe the domain? I'm going to try and write it down.  domain of these products  all positive integers. So when these are all one idea is positive integers.  Other ideas other ideas as many times as many representations we could use for something and some of them are useful in different ways.  Yeah.  unsigned base 2  all the unsigned vase to representations.  I wish we could describe it.  So interesting, so you're giving some giving like a either maybe a what you what you said had two comparisons in it. And then Anne and some kind of logical expression. Maybe we could use to talk about this and maybe there's a way to talk about the positive integers in a different way by saying it's all that X is greater than or equal to one or something like that. Is this a maybe this isn't opposed to talking about it? What other what other ways we can talk about the domain of this product?  I'm going to extend what you said a little bit maybe we'd want to use the set builder notation and talk about X such that X is greater than or equal to one. Maybe that would be interesting this whole top row talking about positive integers is a little bit. It's a little bit interesting to think about this top. Row the exes we have in his table. It's depending on how we want to interpret this table in this problem. It's not clear to me that those are positive that those are supposed to be positive integers careful to say that they were interpreting this as base to expand interpreting the exes 2 expansion.  Or we could just say that it's some sequins P1 the end.  Where in is a positive integer?  and each  is 1 of 0 and 119. Let me get rid of these parentheses 2 typically haven't written parentheses around are sequences in this class.  Maybe it's just a sequence of coefficients which one is 0 and 1 and it's some sequence of them.  That's interesting with that with that are there any missing like if I took that set of all of these be ones to be ends where the the bees are 01. Are there any there any in that specification of the domain that aren't showing up here?  And that description that don't show up in the table.  So when are bass to representation, we are forcing the first bits always be one. I don't free sample just as a hero or zero one in this table. So there be some restriction we need more restrictions if we were really talking about this don't mean it's only the base 2 expansions, right and really what I've written down in the table. That thing is sort of most most accurate would be the right out the definition of it, but it's worth being precise about this because maybe I would have written something here with 0 + 0 1 and then maybe there we have to talk about what it would mean to Me Reddit cats be true or false widows in Romaine here is just the number sequences with basic expansion.  And that's a set that does not fit in some fixed size table. This table keeps going on. But those are all important considerations for sort of figuring out exactly. What is what these products are talking. So the domain is we're taking the domain here as the bit strings of the sequences of zero definition.  Looking at these three predicates. El&m. How can we write them symbolically? Like how can we write them out in this gets had something something people were saying about greater than and less than signs and things like that. But if we wanted to write out predicates symbolically for L&M, what would the end up looking like a much more important question in this setting then it was on Wednesday because on Wednesday, we could always just draw the whole table and talk about we need some representation that symbolic nautical really need to be able to sort of calculate calculate this for any input because we don't have the entire table available. So it's going to become more and more important for us to have medical or symbolic representations of these predicate. So, how can I spend a little bit thinking about how we could write down these representations symbolically as an expression?  Taxi pool some expression or some other way of writing a song.  Okay, so I want to talk through a few of these and there's a few different ways we can think about trying to trying to write these down. So I could write EFX equals something that have something on the right hand side. There's something like that and I'm something or if you say  Something else that doesn't look like this.  So the books are at something down or something like that suggestion.  X mod 2 equals 0  so we had this operation and we talked about early on and maybe we say xmod to is he really careful about where the where the expressions are here? Interesting?  One thing I find interesting about writing it this way. We're going to be there in  Interesting. So so let me know so that I really like this idea of unpacking unpacking the coefficients and I'm looking at something like the last another idea would be the same. Well, there's some structure.  There's some structure to act right? There's some coefficients in their exes a sequence. And so if we want to talk about these these sequences generally well, maybe this is is a sequence of fits under some property of the bits that tells us whether something is even and maybe one way to write this down is to say that the least significant bit is equal to 0.  I want to poke at this top definition for a minute, which is I want to highlight this part here using x-gear know if x is defined as like an actual bit string or sequence of coefficients here. We might want to be more precise than just saying xmod to we it might be reasonable to talk about this instead being something like doing out the arithmetic for the expansion. I'm so really this would be like a bee 1 * 2 to the exponent + 2 * 2 to the exponent in all of it using the definition of a base expansion.  2 is equal to 0  Because if x is really a sip this sequence of coefficients of our domain is just these bit string we need to say something about how to get from these bit strings. We didn't say the number. We didn't pick X's positive numbers. We said exit these get strength from there to a number that we're going to do arithmetic with would probably want to use the definition of the expansion.  So I'd be hesitant to say this. First one is a precise enough definition. I would want to see a definition that uses uses respitech. It was mentioned as maybe we could write something using the set builder notation. So something like  equals  and something in here where maybe be an equal 0 and I'm being a little bit deliberately imprecise. This is not something we should write a predicate definition of a predicate is that it takes an input and produces a true or false value and the right hand side. There is an entire set input and produce either true or false. It should not produce an entire set of values. That might be why you for a particular input  So there was some ideas for those are some ideas for writing down with the Highlight that if we're talking about that string we want to do is the calculation for arithmetic we saw before maybe the least significant bit being 0 can tell us something about even this just as ideas. I just say what I want to just ask. What about L&M what kinds of things might you write for L&M given this discussion what kinds of things might be right for L&M giving all this discussion about for L&M.  All right suggestions for L&M and they don't have to be I don't need to hear entire Expressions. I want to hear some of high-level ideas for L&M. What kinds of things would you write for L&M?  things that you write for L&M  I'm just saying so Pharrell you're saying like there's only a few cases that can make this true. And so maybe for a levesque's a perfectly good definition is it's going to be basically the expansion of acts right so maybe the doing out the arithmetic 4X equals the sequence.  1 or x equals the sequence one zero is that are less than that it have an interpretation is less than 3 so maybe we could just do that.  Is it?  interesting  So you're saying let's look at the structure of this thing, and we know that we said the number is greater than 256 which is 2 to the 8th. And so that must mean that we needed 9 bits to represent it. I think we have to be slightly more clever than that. I think if it was 2:55, like it was one below power of to that idea what actually work exactly but I think I think I just want to make sure it's something maybe folks out there can double double check me here to make sure that I'm getting this right but I think it's 2:57. And so the idea if you're at these boundaries, you can count the number of bits probably something we can build with that idea now. I wish I'd made it safe to 55 cuz I would be a cool answer 511  So what was a really cool idea but just for this constant doesn't quite work. What else what else?  Right. So be as 1 * 2 to the end. Actually, I'm going to write this one out our base expansions just to be just to be clear. Right we have written these out typically is a -1 down to a 0 * 2 to the -1 + expansion all the way out.  When you're saying that has to be greater than 256 so pretty the calculation.  What is multiple ways we can write these out. We also could have written out by doing the base expansion is only a couple values couple Valiums at work and it would be interesting. I'm not going to have this discussion right now. That would be an interesting discussion to have an interesting thing to start demonstrating right being either of these two values is exactly three given the representation. These are all conversations. We can have and next week. We will be talking about going to need the symbolic representations to talk about these predicate and there's lots of ways to write them down symbolically.  So let's get a little practice working with some existential in Universal properties over these predicate over LMA and and eat and then we'll do the demo actually get some more practice doing the same thing over.  over some DNA strand  So here's the first question. I want to ask what's a witness for this predicate?  Or I'm sorry for this existential over a predicate exists an X such that LFX implies anavex. So as the one for less than three times the 1/4 greater than 256.  Cancel for the first round 5 4 3 2 1.  Okay, let's begin again the results of chatting with this for a second.  5 4 3 2 1  so for this kind of question, if you're asking if these specific values are witnesses or not. This means basically plug in the value and evaluates to because we're asking if one is a witness for the essential if 100 is a witness for it. And so I'm so it just kind of question in for looking for Witnesses often times. What we can do is try some values and check them. So this is true that's definitely its representation is definitely less than  Less than three and Emma Vex is definitely false because its representation is not greater than 256. And so the question is what's the result of the implication between these two things? Well, we look up the truth table for implication. If the part before the arrow is true. The part after is false that produces a false. That's actually the one that produces a false for for implication. The hypothesis is true in the conclusion is false about the false prince location. So this can't be a witness who produced false for witness were looking for an element of the domain that produces true for the side of the body of the existential of the expression in the existential.  4100  that is not its representation is not less than 3 its representation is not greater than 256 but looking up the value for implication. That's true time. The hypothesis is false. The results of the implication is true. So this is a witness for this existential, and we see the same things true for the last example.  Where we have a false and the true and because of how implication works this also produces true when the hypothesis is false B application produces produces true.  I'm so both of these are witnesses, which means is correct.  This is actually a bit of a I put this up as a bit of a cautionary example where a implications inside exists are a little bit odd, but they're often true in a sort of useless way. It's true. But thanks for all the rows where Ella Vex is true. We would need em effects to be true for that to be a witness to this client. And that's not a particularly interesting conclusion to draw. I'm so often. It's more useful to use something like a conjunction like and then implication inside an existential implications gives us peace order vacuously true cases.  So I hear someone and and or for L&M, so instead of implication, let's talk about and and or and I also want to talk about this for all speakers interesting to just think about these two these two products that are on different parts of the table and what it means for them to overlap in different ways. So let's think about it with the fur Also. Let's think about which of these is a counterexample for the aura case hear the fur all or but not a counterexample for aunt  So think about this question for me.  All right 5/4.  3  2 1  hey, where did some people go there were more who answered the first round?  No one wants to give a second opinion.  Okay, so, let's see. So let's think about these what we want to think about here is if any of these give us false for one of these cases and not for the other case is really counterexample should give us false for these cases in the student agrees with and actually going to go back and do it on this slide.  How many do you see the mistake on this Sly? Where's the mistake on this slide? I made a mistake.  Yeah, it wasn't you heard. This should not talking about this. So the mistake here is this number if we were to add this up this position is 2 to the 7th not to the gate. So this number is 129. Not not 257. There should be seven zeros for it to be 2:57 by the base expansion work. So it doesn't actually a tall is false for this and it still produces true. We would need to put one more zero in here for it to be.  For this to be true for him effects. I just want to be clear about that the representation I picked with all these zeros is missing 10 to go above 256 Trigger 2.  So if we wanted to talk about so actually let me put up the answers and see if anyone wants to justify. He was very popular among the after discussion answer. Are you for arguing in favor of e are you in favor of e? Yeah, go for it.  interesting  Now you're saying how could it be false for an orbit true for an aunt? That sounds like a nice intuition comment from intuition that says if both of our fault, how can both of them be true to make that and true that doesn't seem like it's something that could happen interesting is that you so we're so you're saying basically in every position where the or would produce false since it has those two predicates is part of it is also produce false. No matter what this is if we have those two predicates, they're interesting anyone of any other arguments to make up for it.  It makes like the end one.  Yeah, so you're saying that L&M form a contradiction so they're always false. So they're always falls because if we go back if we think about the table for all these values we have all of the X values here.  And I'm just going to use here like 110 and in somewhere way down here.  We start to have True Values for the other predicate when this turns into a one down here.  And these are all false.  And this is false and these are false examples for the first claim. So it's hard to find an example here. That's a counterexample for the first but not for the second but not for the second.  So I want to talk I'll see action when a skip this one for now and talk about DNA the last couple minutes because there's some really interesting examples worksheet is that I put stars on the properties that I did on the slides the ones that don't have stars are just there for you to think about there are actually all kind of interesting to think about worksheet. But the ones that are stars of the ones that fit flashed up on the slides that we talked about on the slide, so if you want more practice on this just a lot on there to look at  I want to talk about DNA for the last 10 minutes and some properties about DNA and I have a few different feeling in a couple values for the different credit gets on your own then we'll still some in together and talk about some interesting properties here at least by predicates here.  Okay, so I just want to highlight a few interesting things that  Can see in what in the rose that are here in this table and then start asking some questions. So first of all, the very first row is saying I'm the Strand starts with a and all these strands of DNA by all these predicates are over these sequences. Each of the bases is 1 of 80 g and the definition of a strand is that it's a nonempty sequence or going to have some number of letters in a row all the all the letters are going to be from that set of four letters were talking about some properties of those strands. The First Column is 1 strands that start with a in the second column two strands that end with t that end with T. So, for example, we have a true for the Strand. It's just we have a true here. We have a true here and we have false was in the other places in the stable.  Italic tizen apps are trees in falsettos and monospace font is the basis. So if you see a t in both places the mono space t is the bastey like the code van stee italics to use the Truity this interesting call him that's called the predicate called and says s, which means they have the matching the matching characters with th to make a double helix from here to hear it all falls because none of these are even three bases long to match with to match with tagging part of the property of the double helix, is that the two strands that make up a double helix have the same number of bases in them?  Similarly, we don't have any that we see in this table so far. There may be some further down in the table that start with a t  this last one's interesting. Are there any true rose for this last one in the table that we have? So far true rose for this last one in the table that we have so far just with what we can see here.  Say louder I hear people saying stuff out.  80eighty so if he was saying 80  80 this is a true over here.  The true and I'm just sensitive. I don't have columns row markers.  40a  set ideas when we reverse it things match up.  So when we reverse the reverse the string when you have these things matching.  So let's talk about a few properties of these because there's some interesting properties to discuss her. One of the first things I want to do is call back to our notation that we use when we were talking about some of these bits representations and numbers and ask which of these representations on the right hand side. Here is an accurate symbolic representation of this s starts with a t c predicate which one of these if we allow for equality between symbols or equality is a good symbolic representation of  This is really a question about notation. So.  5 4 3 2 1  So here's a comment. I want to make about this and I put these answers up so that I could sort of poke at one of the answers here.  in this answer  Which is I would say is not correct. We're forcing the length of the Strand RI which is this fixed-length three base sequence has to satisfy this property all of the Strand all possible strands of DNA which is why there's an important distinction between writing and writing D for all possible strands that have a sequence of bases. We're just looking at the first three to say starts with so many elements in the domain make this true this particular predicate true that s starts with a t c  five four  3 2  1  so for starting with a t see there's lots of elements that start with a t c and have more bases in them. For example a TCA acid examples. We can generate there longer than three characters or longer than three bases long and set this up that keeps going to I'm so this is interesting because with these symbolic representations of predicate, we can really have these sets that go on and on and on.  How about this one? How about representing that s, t a g is a double helix, which one of these are notations talks about this predicate one of these is a good representation.  5 4 3 2 1. So again, I want to visit important notational Point here again about B and I'm making this point because I don't want you to make this mistake.  Bichir, we should still not use this fixed-length definition.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
