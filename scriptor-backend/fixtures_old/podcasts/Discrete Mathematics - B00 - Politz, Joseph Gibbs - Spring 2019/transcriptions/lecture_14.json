    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started. So there's too many things I want to do today. One is finish the last property that we didn't get to prove on Monday and then review actually a question from homework 3 one of the ones about Caesar ciphers on homework 3 has a pretty good review of several different things that are not relevant for the amusing so far. So those are the two main things. I want to do today exam 7 p.m. This evening. So let's get let's get started. We've been talking about these overall strategies for doing proofs and we're going to see a new proof technique today. So another one of these strategies for going from the statement of some gold we want to show and using some evidence to prove it and it's going to be another one of these properties over and I want to just refresh our memory about some of the definitions we used on Monday. This is a question about power sets. So we were working with the set that we named W and we to find W is the power set of the numbers one through five. And so I just want to refresh your memory about what that definition means. So which of these these Values here are elements of the set wfaw is defined in this way.  5 4 3 2 1 and it's a good one to discuss people have given some different answers. So it's good to discuss.  Kewanee  Okay, we can again again.  5 4 3 2 1  All right, see how a lot of you were probably looking for Miss many of you may have been looking for f most of the above.  Yeah, I'm hoping for that answer to show up because a B and C are all elements of w there all sets that are subsets of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 so it fits the definition of this is a subset of the 1 2 3 4 5 set subset of that set.  But this is not a subset of 1 2 3 4 5 elements of fiction here between talking about being a subset and being an element of so D is the only option that is not an element of this W set because all the elements have to be sets that are subsets of this original 1 2 3 4 5 set the numbers like to canopy.  Mimi serves as a reminder of what it means to be a power set what it means to be a subset. And so let's go back to this property that this was the second property was on the handout from Monday different properties in when we proved we proved a different property about unions that we show that it was false. And this is a property about power sets take a minute to try and say this in English to one another so just interpret this logical statement and just come up with what it's saying in English.  Okay, so I want to give one one interpretation here one way that I would translate this but I think breathe breathe pretty nicely in English. This is saying for all sets.  in W, which is talking about  if  A&B  are equal  then A and B are equal or are the same set would even do something I'd say at the end and then those sets must be if we take any pair of sweats and be in this in W here. Do you think this claim is true or false? You think this claim is true or false question just be as liquor answers. I do you think it's true or false? Are we going to somehow prove it or are we going to be able to find a counterexample?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so is this is true, but many votes for both front a claim like this is to think about examples. So what would it look like to fill in some examples for for A and B to see if it's true true for all the examples we can think of it's probably a good idea.  So what are some examples that we could fill in fill in for a and b and then try talking about their their values in the statement? Give me some examples of A&D that would be interesting here examples of A and B.  examples  examples of A and B  so when I pick one of them being the set 1 2 3 4 5  Both of them both of them. So equals 1 2 3 4 5 equals 1 2 3 4 5. So this is an interesting example because we picked two sets that are equal two sets that are equal to mean to evaluate the body of this but we'd have to fill in 1 2 3 4 5 everywhere A&B appear in this statement. We be asking is 1 2 3 4 5  equals power set of 1 2 3 4 5  implies  I think this will work. Well.  implies that these are equal  That's what it means to feel in these values of A and B, whether or not this evaluates to true the conclusion of this implication definitely evaluates to true. So we'd be asking if the the power sets of these two things evaluate to true.  Seems like it would be hard for them not to.  I'm not having week if the power has power sets of the same sets. It seems like that'll probably evaluate the truth would be a lot of work to write it all out and check my hand that they're all the same but it'd be very strange sitting pretty something at the same. What are the examples we could try example. So this seems Seems like true seems  Like true implies true in this case. What are the other cases? We can try other examples we can try that would be interesting.  So we can try a equals 1/2 and B is one so that statement would be the power set of 1/2.  Equal to the power set of just a set containing one implies. That one II any 1/2 is equal to the set containing one. In this case. We know that the conclusion year is going to be false those sets aren't equal. I had better be the case. If the hypothesis were true here, then we would end up with a counterexample. This one's actually were thinking about in a little bit of detail what the power set of 1/2 power set of 1/2. We're still seeing how this competition is going to play out talk about it. What's the power set of 1/2?  Okay, so so what are what sorts of things are in the power set of one to start shouting out some of the elements of the power set of 1/2?  What's the right?  1 2  What else?  21 an empty set  They're asking if that's that is equal to the power set of one and that's just the empty set and the set containing one.  And that's definitely now we can sort of see that that's definitely false. We got everything listed on the roster notation is this going to happen for every example, we can think of we have two examples now where this produces its overall claim is going to evaluate the truth. I'm in the question is how can we be certain there? How can we argue that? This is actually going to happen for every single example we put in here.  This is a general approach. You can take when you when you encounter these proofs which is to say, I'll try some examples if I can't find a counterexample. Let's start a proof and see if I can come up with a convincing argument. So that's the next step here. If we're going to try and prove this true. We're believing that it's true and we're going to try and prove it true are proof is going to have to start with universal generalization and we're going to have to say this is our to show up here and we're going to stay by Universal generalization.  choose a and b as  as arbitrary elements  W from W A and B are sets and their sets that are in this powersat. W.  and there's a couple things we can try we can try next the most direct thing to try next is this idea that our current to show would be  Power set of a bull's power set of B implies a equals B proof here, right? So one strategy to use is this a bye direct proof?  Are to show is a equals B, and we get to assume that the power set of a equals the power set of be sure to try this proof on your own. There is a nice way to make this work, but I want to demonstrate another way to do this proof that I think is more.  When we wrote this first example, and we saw that the conclusion was true that these the sets were equal. It was pretty obvious that the power sets were going to take the same arguments. The equal power sets only wrote this first example, there's another way to do this. So I'm going to leave this as a  Try this out. Try this right proof out, but I'm going to demonstrate a different proof technique here.  So are to show is currently this implication.  and  there's a nice use of just a logical equivalences we can do here to say that we can actually turn this into assuming that Q is false and using that as something assumption to show the PS4 that's kind of like rewriting this into not April B implies. Not a power set of a equals power set of B.  That's actually a logical equivalence prewriting strategy proof of conditional by using the contrapositive because that's the that's the rewriting we're doing.  And so we can rewrite our to show this way and say what we're going to do. Is this actually I want to say this in two ways.  This we can say by logical equivalence cuz these are logically equivalent another way we could write this is just by saying.  Fire Contra proof by contraposition of a conditional are new to show is the negation of the Assumption.  And we get to assume.  The negation of the conclusion to assume that not able to be as you can think of this as we did with this new rule that says we have an implication. We're going to assume the negation of the conclusion and prove the negation of a hypothesis something we get out of this is now our evidence. The thing we assume is this not able to be we get to assume this negation being really helpful because there's some really good evidence to work with if two sets aren't equal a minute just talked for 10 20 seconds and come up with any questions you have so far any questions you have so far about the other thing.  Any questions come up so far happy so far. Yeah.  The definition of contrapositive for four conditionals is to just negate. That's just what contrapositive means on a conditional statement.  So it's like I don't know. I mean like the inverse and the converse and then you do both then you get the contrapositive and I don't know all of the reasons why those words were chosen, but this is a definition of contrapositive.  So now we get to assume that a is not equal to B and we have this goal of showing at the power sets aren't equal. So it's interesting to ask what we do and we can expand the definition of set equality here. And what we get is the negation of the set equality definition and the set equality definition says for all x x is in a if and only if x is in feet.  That's why I just took the definition of set equality that's defined on the sheet. Just expanded that definition in place here for a and b.  and from this we can do a little bit of logical equivalence rewriting here and it says that there exists an X so that it's not true that X has an a  if and only if taxes in D.  Under the nice logical equivalence that we can do it again that makes this very nice and clean to read where the negation of a biconditional is the same as X or so, we can say that X has an A or exclusively x's and be so it's it's definitely going to be in Hindi.  One of those things is true.  So again, I'm just being logical equivalences I rewriting is here so that we can be so that I can get a phrase that way of writing it that I really like so exist in and X is not in me.  or  X is not in a and exiting B.  When they can't both be true.  That's pretty cool. So now I'm going to start I'm going to use a new name and say we're going to pick this element. We know some elements exists with this property is this statement means we got we rewrote our assumption to say there exists an element that looks like this.  Why?  And we know that this is true of why I'm doing this just to be clear when I have this exists statement as an assumption working with why I kind of like it's a value that I'm going to be able to use another place. It's like I can talk about it and I can talk about other operations on why.  Because I know that because I know that one of them ones that's why I must exist.  And then blow this I just want to remind us of what we're trying to show.  our current goal is to show  a way to think about proof swimwear in the middle of them is where all these assumptions were making an approved right now the green stuff at the bottom of this property is currently our assumption rewrite our assumption about into this statement in one set and not the other set and what we're trying to show is just what we can prove this that the power sets aren't equal.  Nope, there's this funny business where we have an order here, and we would like to basically be proving that this implies. This conclusion is trying to say is that if we had so there's one more proof idea we can use here which works when we have this these kinds of assumption that look like multiple cases fit for man, or we know that and if we can prove that any one of those things that justifies the conclusion that we have in mind, then we can justify the conclusion statement.  if we can show that all of the different parts of that or  satisfy the conclusion imply the conclusion that we can conclude that conclusion that we want. One thing we need to show is that why and why not in b  implies not power set of a equals power set of B.  And then another thing we need to show is that why not in a and Y in b  Implies the same thing.  This lady has called proof by cases saying look, we're in a world where one of several possible things is true. We have to demonstrate that all of those satisfying conclusion. No matter which one is true. We know that the conclusion is going to be true. So sometimes we could imagine having an assumption that look has many or isn't it and we would have to extend this out. In this case. We have exactly two parts of the Assumption.  So we know we have some that implies this in our goal is to show this negation. Our goal is to show this negation.  this negation is  I can be expanded again using the definition of set equality we can say for all Animusic capital x here because I want to use capital letters for sets to be clear that the thing I'm going to pick here as asset can be expanded to saying  X is in the power set of a  biconditional X is in the power set of B. That's the definition of set equality there.  Just expanding a definition and we have why in a and why not envy.  Wheels are here when we want to show an implication we can use direct proof so we can say that are to show in this case. Is this right hand side of the implication?  And we get to assume.  this why I exist and why not envy  interesting  So we're trying to show a we're trying to show the negation of after all and we have some assumptions. We have some evidence. The goal is to show indication of a first we have some evidence. What's the next step?  All right. So what's a possible next step or go Largo looks like the negation of a fur all so what would we use when we want to prove the negation of aperol?  Yeah.  look at that we could push the negation inside and turned into a witness other ways of saying access that that's one way of saying it what are other ways of saying this proving the negation of a fur all  starts with a C  rhymes with announcer example  navigation inside and getting this also means we could look for a counterexample. So what we should show here will be nice is if we could choose.  something  as a counterexample.  Right. We'd like to choose some specific value that we can fill in for Capital ex then demonstrates that that body is false and we need to pick a specific value starts at that body is false. And now all we know about A and B is that there's some arbitrary set that came from other than what's a good value to picture that we could use as a counterexample.  the set containing why  so the set containing why?  Are there any other ideas to be an interesting one to push through but I want to take other ideas first.  But empty set bigger counterexample.  yes, Keep On Keepin On  oh, that's interesting. So that is true for end up being a bad idea for kind of the reason you're saying for this claim. There are places where they could be like if we had to be tried to say something like there is an element in the set s then capital x empty set is going to be in the power set of mini sets mini said being so we might in fact it is true and it might not be a good counterexample work because of this particular cleaning up our sets.  What's push through this idea of this example the other ones that could work and we have to push them through our new goal to be to show that.  This is true. So the negation of this body with built-in, so why?  in the power set of a if and only if  Why?  in the power set  of beat  so I just took the suggested counterexample done the same thing with the different set and we would still have to demonstrate that. This claim is evaluating to true so that we know that it's counterexample, but we take this set containing Justice element y  This is getting interesting because we can talk about what it means for y to be in the power set of a at War for why to be in the power set of B with the assumption that we have in this case, so I want to highlight this assumption.  This information that we know about why?  And so why is an element has a so by the definition of power sets the set containing y must be in the power set of a we know that why is an element today?  is true in this is true by definition of power set because  what's because we know that Y is an element of a  And that's one of our assumptions. We know the way.  also  By the way, power sets defined.  Why can't be in the power set of B?  Because why isn't an element to be?  And so there's no way that said containing y could be a subset of B, which would be what it would need to be true for it to be an elemental that power set.  This little bit of information that we got about why from knowing that the sets are equal in this case is enough to show that that set containing y has to be in the power set of a and can't be in the power set of B.  And that's because of this subset the sun setting in the definition of that power set definition.  So that means we can rewrite this.  Claim as why the second inning why in the power set of a that's true?  And the other claim is false.  We're trying to prove the negation of this cool. So true isn't only a false evaluates the false. So this whole claim evaluates to true.  And that finishes off at least this case so that finishes off this first case if we call this case one.  In case two is going to be exactly the same argument just with this by definition of power set. Why in the power set of a day is fall and by definition of power set the set containing why is in the power set of B is true. So we'll end up with a different false. If and only if true in the second to last stop, but the argument will be exactly the same just using the evidence in the opposite way.  And so what this what this argument is saying is what the sets weren't equal. We could always find some element.  Within one of the sets and not in the other set and show that the power sets.  So here, why did Arie right to get to this basically?  So I rewrote to get to this because the the structure of this problem requires finding a counterexample for the right hand side. If we picked this proof technique for negating the conclusion and then trying to prove the negation of a hypothesis. We're trying to find a counterexample and rewriting by logical equivalence to something that's it exists makes it clear that we have some element to work with right and so the existence is the thing that makes it a good argument to say there is someone and I can always talk about this particular element properties and really there's two ways that this proof kind of goes for any particular example, like a plug-in values for a and b  Has some element that's not him be but maybe he has some elements that overlap and we need to be able to do either one of those arguments because A or B could be a subset of one another and then we need to pick the element that I'd like the odd one out. And so we need that or to describe those two possible scenarios.  certain question other questions about this  That's a great question. So the question is it doesn't seem like this property that A and B were from this restricted domain of w in order to do this proof an impact. Mainly I did that in this proof so that we can be really clear about specific examples because this property is true for all kinds of domains that we could pick instead of w true for all kinds of domain so we can take instead of typing. So I made it. I made it be really specific because it helped us think about these examples, but this is much more general property than just these numbers 1 2 3 4 5 is true for many many donated.  This is true first that's containing like any of the values we talked about in this class so far. What are their colors are DNA strands?  Other questions about this proof questions about this.  So we used will you sort of all the first techniques we know so far to do this proof. We did Universal generalization. We use this new idea of assuming the negation of the conclusion is contrapositive idea. We use direct proof inside these cases and we use proof by cases to use the or to conclude something.  and we get a pretty convincing argument with this statement statement is in fact true and some just going to make a note here that this was would be case too and we could say something like  and I'm just going to say similar argument.  2 case 1  using pee in a sorry using  why not exists in the power set of a but why is an element of the power set of B, which is just a flip of what we have off.  I want to review this song Caesar Cipher question for the rest of the class.  And I want to make a few things.  Symbolic that weren't necessarily symbolic in the definition in the homework. So just to refresh your memory and all these definitions are in the back side of the hand out. So just refresh your memory. There was this idea that letters can be in these different categories of, medium and rare and then Caesar Cipher is were these functions that we talked about taking a letter shifting it by a certain amount and in producing a new letter of the Caesar Cipher is talking about shifting a letter. So has the number and an input and output letter.  Then there's these three other products that sell us lclm and those are going to be a little more than one of these categories and then there's this El Cap predicate that's trying to express these letters are different and not in the same category. First question. I want to ask us to work with this symbolic Hellcat definition. Some of the pieces inside is which of these claims a B and C are true, which of these propositions end up being true and they're using is lclm and biconditionals on specific letter Z the J are specific letters. So which of those are true statements?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay freaking again. And again, this is also a bit of a review of a biconditional means is hemp is actually the real reason I'm asking this specific question.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so we can look at this first one which is saying be is common a common letter if it only if Z is a common letter in letter. If and only if Z is a common letter doesn't help me that much to understand what's going on here so we can ask is that is Elsie of be true?  Viacom and let her know and neither is z  so we end up with false if and only if false and this is true or false if and only if false evaluates to true the biconditional says that the values of the same Lake Nona gation and X are both our faults than biconditional Valu evaluate. The truth is a true statement. It is a truth is one of these is that's true is a  The next question is is be a medium frequency letter. If and only if J is a medium frequency letter.  Well, that's a true for B. It is medium on medium frequency and a false for Jay because Jay is rare. And so this evaluates to false.  So this isn't true.  And then this last case we're asking if B is common. If and only if B is coming in again that's going to be a fall.  and if all that evaluates to true  I'm so there were two of these that I went to true. So remember that in biconditionals, we're really looking for this matching Behavior being the same and we'll see now that will do an example with milk at the putting these together actually statements are true hear these statements about El Cap.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, and so here what's happening is for this first one for BB this ends up being false. But only because of this part of the elk a predicate elk a predicate. What about you ate the truth would evaluate the truth because in this case we'd end up with false. If and only if false true if and only if true and false if and only if false so you get true true true for these pieces, but since the letters are equal to make the whole thing Falls cuz it's all in hand is not true.  So be is true.  because intuitively being why are in the same category here and we should think about why this ends up working out for be and why we end up with just the medium case with true implies true if and only if true  This ends up being true this ends up being false. If and only if false this ends up being false if and only if false so we have for truth and it together for this case conditional is making sure that the letters really are in the same category. If they're in different categories. One of these would end up producing false does not work cuz they're in A & B are in different category. So we'll end up with one of these mismatching and get a false for one of these ends up usefully describing.  This idea that the numbers are the letters are in the same category and not equal to each other and that was a big part of the definition of of the site for being so pure so the last thing that I want to do is the last question because once we do this is useful for the last thing I want to have up here is which one of these represents this property of being secure where this property was that whenever the Caesar Cipher shifts a letter in the same letter produced and produces a letter that's in the same category that idea Caesar Cipher produces new letter that's in the same category for every letter.
