Okay, let's get started.  so  we're going to talk about more proof strategies today and I just want to remind you of upcoming upcoming deadlines Monday. I'm in the midterms going to be next Wednesday evening. And we're going to be posting Logistics of that about that. I'm just some things. I want to make sure you know, if you can use a note card for notes for the exam will posts like Dimensions. If you really want to know number of inches in The Piazza post. So it's posted in one place and the material on it is up to Monday's lecture including this week Mondays lecture, which was April 22nd. And today I will be posting some practice questions. So we wrote up some practice questions kind of in the style of like homework warm-up kinds of questions that are things you should  Spectre review to be ready for the exam and there will be assigned seats in the exam and you can look on the website for the time and room the exam is 7 to 9 p.m. On Wednesday evening. And you can look online for the room the corresponds to the section not say details in class just so I don't accidentally say something wrong and then being consistent with the Piazza post. So all this information goes  The sea and also if you're thinking about exams it's worth reading the exam policy. That's the grading policy for exams on the grading of the mid-term in the final go together on your calendar to come to the midterm exam next Wednesday night.  So let's talk about doing some more proof. So we what we started talking about on Wednesday.  My is how to do some proofs of universal statement true or existential statements being false statement being true. And we use this strategy called Universal generalization where we picked an arbitrary elements from the domain and used to show that the predicate was true. And we actually know a little bit about logical equivalence existentials that we can use to prove that X Essentials or false because we have some that tell us how to negate an existential and not something that we're going to see in use today, but I want to go back to talking about DNA for a little bit and we're going to prove some and some for all statements in an interesting way.  The property I want to bring up factoring on Wednesday in the idea with factoring is that we're talking about integers where they're evenly divided by some other integer or pairs of integers that multiply together to produce another integer. They were talking about this relationship between us and we describe for all statements for existing users that are even or just the integers that are in a certain range is reasonable things 100. Those are things that we like to say. It's worth seeing. How does play  Into some of the notation we've been using so we're going to use this predicate that is this product of a number having exactly two positive factors for an integer having exactly two positive factors and we're going to think about how we can restrict domain and positive integers further and if it helps us true depending on how we restrict the domain, so the first the first question here is which of these five options to make this statement, which of these five options could be interesting to think about if there's more than one of them are not make sense here for DB.  5 4 3 2 1  just got this one just briefly just briefly.  Okay, so I'm not going to have you pick it again. I just wanted to give you a chance to talk about this for a second most the most popular answers since I have the definition of prime which says a positive integer is only positive factors of 1 and P on the kind of matches. This idea is talking about only factors being one in p how can we make the statement true of having a true as well? If any of the others could make this trip into statements invitation we've been using and talk about a potential counter examples for the other cases are some interesting counterexamples here.  I'm the first one was this extra constraint that and is less than 4 and so when we restrict the domain with these for all statements that these are all statements that stay for all positive integers for all and that are from the positive integers refer to the positive integers one above.  And we might try and add something here. Maybe like maybe we want some notation and  Less than four, maybe we try and fit it in there and there's several ways. We could try and write new notation to express this idea or restricting this domain to just the numbers that are less than four but it turns out a few lectures ago. It turns out there's a way to express we already have and when we have a fur all statement that restricts the domain we can always express the restricted domain as we can say that we want the body here to be in less than 4  Implies. I wrote this a predicate on your sheet is defined as the end has exactly two positive factors that we were talking about. Just as a reminder on on the slide here event is  and has two positive factors.  Exactly two positive factors. The key idea here is that we can take this restricted domain is restricted domain statement that Anne has to be less than four and we can put that in front of an implication in that actually will Express the restricted domain for us.  So this is a translation of that first statement into the notation we're used to so there is some number in the positive integers and it has to be less than 4 and for all of those we're going to have this property that has exactly two positive factors times answer over there. We should have some counterexample.  I'd shows that this isn't true or false.  one interesting  So the suggestion is an equals one is a counterexample to this.  Oh, yeah, that's kind of nice case to think about here where the entire set of numbers that end could be here is one two three in the case where this the left hand side of the implication is true. Those are those are all the others only the number one any other factors that we can multiply together to get to one if we're talking about.  Buy all of the things we can multiply together to get to one. Well in terms of just the only solution is here for the factors that we might take for AMC are going to be one that has to do with definitions of integer arithmetic.  Interesting. Okay. So one is a counterexample here.  because  the only  And really it is right. The only positive factors of one is or are one and we can talk about justifying that statement in a lot more detail to what would you try and say to me to tell me about The only positive factors of 1 is there a hard one? Like how do you justify that part of this claim?  Express it in any other way.  Yeah, how would you justify add approve it?  I got to set up an equation.  Yeah, the only thing you can do that as once I started high level argument. I made any other way, you could try expressing this using the ideas. We have like exists and for all the way we can talk about that.  Interesting interesting. Let me try and express this. I'm not going to go through a whole discussion of this property is a few things. I want to discuss but you said something like a million paraphrasing what you said, but you said something like we could express this as and let me call this actually just so we don't get it confused with and if there  Not equal to one.  Then they can't possibly be a factor of 1.  And the factor of one predicate is the one that says we can find some number to x m equals one and you're saying that's never going to happen. And that would be the statement where we can start pushing through the algebra, right? We drive to say well there's going to be this exists inside the factoring predicate and we show that there can't possibly exist such an integer to push through if we weren't willing to take this idea of the only positive factors of 1 being one at face value we could express  So that was that's a discussion of how to do.  And this would be sort of.  depending on  How much were willing to take for granite about we may need to contact where we have enough algebra assumptions that were willing to make that we can take for granted that we can have as an assumption?  So what about be so be above said?  Get that up against a b above said that is nonnegative as the constraint. So here we have for all in in the Plus.  And our extra constraint would be that n is greater than or equal to 0.  I'm the extra clips Derby the extra constraint here.  bank account examples for this  4  I'm saying for is an interesting counterexample or the master form equals 4 is an interesting counterexample.  The evidence that four is a counterexample. How do you justify that Forza counterexample?  4/2 factor is 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 so you're saying because  And equals 2 * 2 + n equals 1 x 4 1/4 are numbers that we can use as factors for n?  and if we were talking about our factoring predicate from the last lecture by definition of factoring  and one thing I want to find out here is we don't have any argument that says these are the only factors of 4 we kind of know it like we can tell as humans used to dividing numbers by one another that the only factors of 4 are factors exist can say here is since an has at least  3 factors  it can't  have exactly two.  Demonstrates that 4 is a counterexample given evidence that it has more factors than what the predicate requires.  Setia band can't be true and the constraint was true.  Look at the first see that's greater than 3 we've already we already have a great counterexample. So play mins after all and in the positive integers if an is greater than or equal to 3.  That is exactly two positive factors. And there's a counterexample here we can just use for again. We couldn't use one again cuz it wouldn't satisfy the constraint that is greater than or equal to 3/4 again for would be a good time. For example here at the prime one that we're going to have to come back to and talked about doing it showing that a true and he had no extra constraint. So this would just be for all and that are positive integers then.  I'll be that statement examples for that Casey.  How many samples for e?  We reuse either 4 or 1.  cigar  could use for again because this again this actually Ian be me and the say they're going to be true at the same time because that any greater than or equal to 0 constraint in be this constraint is it's extra. There's no way that this could ever be false. So this is because Anne is already a positive integer is really just an extra part of this expression that makes it that it would be logically equivalent.  so we are have been taking Z + 2 mean the positive integers like starting at 1 so  because it's not part of the domain. Yeah, so is this x it's a it's like a we could also say and is greater than or equal to negative 5 and as long as we have a definition of greater than equals, dates positive numbers and negative numbers and then we get the same behavior.  But actually can come into play in a proof by Universal generalization because you might pick something from the domain and then realize that part of it you're trying to show it being in the domain, right? So we were just trying to prove the claim for all end that are in the positive integers and is greater than or equal to 0 overall before this one. We could use actually for this one either would work.  We could use one or four with someone.  So those four possible answers all have counterexamples, right? So none of those were true.  And the answer most of you gave and that is interesting to talk about true. Is this other one that for all positive integers and if and his Prime and that's I wrote that as the predicate are on your sheet and it's how I abbreviated it. If n is prime positive factors against using that idea of restricting the domain written as an implication inside of her all.  This is what we would like to show and so we sort of believe this is true. At least the vast majority of you to demonstrate that this is true. So we have and we're going to use this new fact that's on the right and it's the new new property that's listed at the top of your sheet to do a little bit of work to get there. So we have it for all clean. The claim is that there's some for all so one of the things we can start by doing.  Bye.  And this is not the property that's on the right. This is just the same thing. We used at the end of last class.  We can pick and we can say let me be some arbitrary elements going to be a positive integer from the domain and then we have a new thing to show.  We have to show that.  This implication is true.  So we started with this claim and Universal generalization, lets us take off the fur all in with this extra assumption that we have a particular element, and I know that he is that it's a positive integer so far.  And now we're going to use this other this other proof techniques here where we can prove an implication by assuming the hypothesis is true and using that assumption as evidence the conclusion this there's a part of this that is needs to be justified a little bit like a pro strategy. Well if the hypothesis is false, then we know that the whole implication evaluates the false. So there's no evidence. We need to generate in that no further Evidence. We need to generate in the case for the hypothesis is false write an argument or more evidence. Is it by hypothesis is true because in that case we need to demonstrate that the conclusion will always be true for the whole statement to be true were using this property of implication when the hypothesis is false.  a case where the hypothesis is true so that lets us say in this is  this will be named on a future slide, but I'm going to name it. I'm going to name it here.  Buy direct proof of a conditional or by direct proof of an implication and what we can do is assume.  The RV is true.  And then we need to show.  That TV is true using any information that's available to us. Now that we've assumed the information about you being prime or RV being true.  So we get to make this assumption.  And now we're going to use that information to say something about exactly two positive factors.  existing 4E to prove t  I'm so I'm because RV is is true.  Right by the definition of prime or by the definition of RV being true. We know a couple things as integer. That's Prime must be greater than one definition of prime says that he must be greater than 1  that's the first part of the Prime definition and the other part of the Prime definition says if the only positive factors of that number are 1 and itself  there's just one bit of extra justification needed to go from this evidence to the conclusion the predicate exactly two factors that  Since he is greater than one he definitely does not equal one.  Paint is definitely not the same as one which was the only evidence we had about this number didn't tell us that it wasn't equal to one we could end up with the same situation. We ended up in with a counterexample for a few of the earlier earlier claims. It's only Factor but since its prime, we know that it's greater than one that's part of the definition of prime. That's where we get some evidence that tells us that he's not one. So he's some number that is greater than one and it's only factors are in one.  So we know that they are two different.  factors  And since the definition of prime says that they're the only ones we get to just use that information from the definition of prime cuz we're assuming it by this director of strategy.  Lenny has exactly these two factors.  TV must be true in this case the proof because we finished showing the last thing we needed the last thing we had this TV station.  Any information from Prime along with eating a positive integer? Let us let us conclude this.  so  One of my light one or two more things in different color. So where we said use that assumption here that's really us sort of collecting all of this information out of the definition of primeness.  And where we say showing Q is true down here. We put together this new in this new evidence. We have and finally demonstrate that this just final part. So that's where were using different pieces of that definition.  Good questions about the structure of this thing. As you were surprised that came up or sink should have come up with didn't think about it for a minute, questions you have about this this description of medication about a permit.  Okay questions about this questions about this.  questions or comments comments welcome to  I think someone is asking what is QED mean if I heard right somewhere. I think I heard that question come up. I'll forget the Latin off the top of my head. So this is where we pronounce it wrong. So let's say I was getting a new window up.  What does QED mean there we go.  Don't be afraid to ask it's a quad s demonstrate that middle what it means is in the English translation. Is that which was to be demonstrated?  Sing the last thing that I said, it demonstrates the original goal of the proof. So basically misses this matters in the sense that it doesn't really matter. If you write the words QED it matters that you write something that says the last thing that the last Heisman. In finishes the proofer is the last piece of evidence. We need to finish the proof. So often drawn is a little square at the end of a proof either filled in her Halo. What is a little square at the end of the proof in that is like a symbol at the end of a proof. It'll mean QED or we're done now this was the last thing to demonstrate  What are questions questions?  So I want to move on to another application where we're still going to be working on this idea of breathing things with withdrawals. And so for this one what I want to do is  start with  play an English sentence and turn it into the statement. We're going to try to prove and I think the English sentence we can probably agree that it's saying something true. So the English sentences, there is no DNA strand as that starts with a t c and doesn't start with a  Will never be able to find a DNA strand that starts with ATC but doesn't start with that. I think we can all agree. This is true that I think we can all agree are true for these because I want to make sure we agree that our goal is to show that these things are true as we go forward with Bruce will be able to use them to discover things. So the first question is how would we express this in terms of universal and existential and then we can work on demonstrating that proof?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay clicking again clicking again.  5 4 3 2 1  so the a part of this that I want to highlight is there is no part of this in English and the thought of another way to say there is no is there does not exist and they're does not exist is going to map really well and 2D which says there does not exist a strand and this is different from saying there's some DNA strand such that some property isn't true. This is different than saying there. Is this the DNA strand where property is is false or not true. This is saying there doesn't exist. Any none of them are going to be able to satisfy that. Translation can guide us towards A&D here.  Matches English pretty well that starts with a d c and doesn't start with a there's a conjunction here. There's a negation here for the doesn't start with a and so this matches really well. I'm in D is the representation I would take for the symptoms here. I mean this matches extremely well sort of a direct translation. It's worth pointing out that this implication is not logic this case. So it's  There is a difference between this and here we talked about this a little bit that existentials with implication inside would be true for every DNA strand. That doesn't start with a t c be true for all of those DNA strands those would all be on Witnesses for the existential. But in this case with the conjunction if strand doesn't start with a t in the whole conjunction is false, so there's a distinction there.  Okay, so let's talk about let's talk about proving this claim. So and I want to set up for this is I'm going to step through several rules that we would use in order to break this down into pieces that can be demonstrated by exactly the rules. We've seen so far original claim if we pick to use the representation, which I think is a good representation of this is that there is no es.  That's a strand.  I wear patc of s is true and PAs is false starts with a C in PA starts with a  and the first thing we're going to do with this is say well, we're trying to prove the negation of an existential and we know that's a proven existential false. One of the things we can do is turn it into a for all statement and then use Universal generalization. So say  Why does logical equivalence?  It would be.  also sufficient to show that for all of us  It's not true that patc about us and not PA of us is using this property here when we have the negation of an existential we can move the negation inside and change their does not exist for all of the exes. Not the avexis true.  So that gives us a new goal and it's a new guy. We have a strategy for that kind of cool when we have a for all kind of proof to show we can use this idea of  picking an arbitrary element. I want to be really explicit about something as I step through this particular proof, which is that we keep getting these intermediate goals and I'm labeling every intermediate this phrase to show and the idea with each of these intermediate goals is it if we can satisfy these intermediate goal the claim that we had before would be true as well. So if we can show the disc for all statement is true, then the original existentialist skulls of for all we know the four alls we can try and use Universal generalization. So by Universal generalization,  let  from the set s  Be an arbitrary elements.  Of the domain and now the new thing we have to show.  Is this internal statement with e?  With the assumption that he used some specific value, but all we know about it is that it's a DNA strand.  Sonu Google we have another thing marked with to show here.  And now this doesn't match any of our strategies. We don't have a strategy for proving negations of ants it does not something we use for that. We can try true. That's one thing we can try and we can try and grab the definition of ATC and maybe we did we demonstrate with logical equivalences we know is maybe it's autology or something like that. What I'm going to do for for this example is say well, we do know something that's kind of what we're learning today. We do know something about proving that implications are true. There's this new strategy of this direct proof of conditional. So if we could make this look like a conditional then we could use that and assuming he starts with a t  I was trying to make this look like a conditional.  So we can take a couple steps of logical equivalence here rewrite this into a form that looks like a conditional and then we can apply a Technique we know.  so  Biological equivalence. Well, we can use demorgan's law this bottom one is called demorgan's law.  and we can rewrite this as  not p8ece or not. Not not in front of the knob PA. So applied to Morgan's law.  And we could even label that specific rule that we used to repay that we can talk about the negation of the negation being equal to the inside. So buy some more logical equivalences.  We can make this look like not p8ece or p a r e.  And we have a logical equivalence that tells us the relationship between expression and implication.  And we can get this implication up.  So I had to know when I was thinking about this proof that I could reach for the logical equivalences when I had some compound proposition and rewrite the compound proposition treating the predicate says things that I leave alone. I'm not looking inside the predicates right now. I'm just these propositional operations where I have a strategy I can use and so this last statement is now another thing that I could show to justify the entire chain of proof. I've set up so far.  Next goal is to show that this is true.  And that's when we get to use our new rule.  That we can have this direct proof on conditionals. And so  We can assume.  That pitc Avicii.  Is true and then we have a new to show.  Which is finally just as predicate from assuming that is true by the definition.  of p8ece  he starts.  with  ATC that's the way we wrote the predicate definition.  Based on this specific definition of saying he starts with a t c we can think about me and some other in some interesting ways. For example, we know that he must look like a B1 B2 B3.... DNA DNA strand must be equal to be too must be equal to T & B 3 must be equal to see what means to start with.  ATC so this is the kind of evidence we get out of that predicate if we assume that it starts with a t ends that we have available. In this case. The one that's going to be incredibly useful is this one right B one is equal to applied to applied to a DNA strand. I'm just going to write it down here. But if you look at the definition of PA  s it says B1 equals a  whereas sequels be one... Bien evidence. We need to demonstrate that is true for eat.  So we could even say by definition of p a of E.  All we have to show is that b is that?  Let me use two different letters here to be really clear.  I'm going to say see one must be be one.  Must be equal today is it to show?  We're again we're using this idea that we can break up into these b-1b ends. TTC is true.  and now the whole chain of reasoning we can think about is evidence that B1 equals a demonstrates that must be true for this input e  That tells us that in all the cases where patc is true PA is true. So this entire implication must always be true because in all the cases where the hypothesis is true with that information, we can demonstrate that. The conclusion will be true. If that is true. Then by all of these logical equivalences. This original negation is true. If this is true, then we can say that by the universal generalization we can get this for all statement and after all statement is logically equivalent to the original we used all of these different pieces. We've built up for demonstrating proofs to get drill down into the statement to show that the first base fee is enough evidence to show that the first base will always be asopa will be true. So we'll be using this kind of proof structure going forward to break apart these statements.  pieces of evidence that we need an argument that the originals  San Diego "
