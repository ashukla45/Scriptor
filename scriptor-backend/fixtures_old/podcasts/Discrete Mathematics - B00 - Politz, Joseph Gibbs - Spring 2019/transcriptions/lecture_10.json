    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. Let's get started. Good morning. Everyone. Happy Monday. Hope you had a great weekend deadline reminders for this week. Are that the second homework is due tonight. So Monday is the Home Run Derby do Thursday evening. So today what we're going to thank you today. What we're going to talk about is we're going to try to get a little bit more today. The thing we're going to do is talk about predicate that take tuples as arguments are there domain is a set of tuples because this is going to let us eat multiple values to one another so far all the predicate we've talked about have just had sort of one value as their arguments like one one DNA strand or one number. Or one bit string representing a binary number. There's a lot of interesting interesting structure and problems. And so what we need to talk about predicates that have a domain that's two bowls of values. So what are the main tools were going to need to do this? Is this idea call Cartesian product which lets us take to Seth and then talk about a set that's a combination of the elements from those sets. So this was one of the definitions in the reading and I just want to wait a couple points in this definition the definition here in this is I just copy pasted this from the textbook is a x b r a cross B. Sometimes I pronounce that symbol that's in between A and B Cross or X is the set of all ordered pairs and, be Refer to ordered pairs, but the book called them ordered pairs as well, But we usually have been saying to teufel in the assignment write up Suite written 2 - 2 full movie and then there's a way of writing it out with that Builder notation. So the idea here is we can take two steps and build a new set out of them and the new set is all the ordered set of ordered pairs. That's all the combinations of elements from those two steps. So we just take all possible combinations of two elements from those two and that's a new set of tuples is going to let us talk about these bigger collections that are built out of smaller collections. So I want to get some practice with this. So I've written out a set here that the set of two two poles in the question. And then what I want to ask is which of the uses of Cartesian product or cross product produced the same as this set or equal to this set. I'm so have a look at this and do that means you two rounds on this. So please do the first-round quietly and then I'll have you discussed. So which of the options below I change my clicker frequency. Let me have to change it back. Sorry about that. In here, it's ba. 5 4 3 2 1  Okay Cricket again. There's a fair amount of agreement but not everybody agreed. So I just want to see what happens on a second round.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay. Alright. So the man is the main thing I want to focus on is if is if a works or not so looking at a which is the set containing 0 across the set containing one or the second painting zero Cartesian product with the set containing one where we have two holes where the first element in the tube corresponds to the lowercase a has to come from the first and the second element. That's the lowercase B has to come from the second set zero one is definitely two to full or an ordered pair that we can get from the cross product of these two sets.  And that's it. There's no other ordered pairs are no other to two fools we can get by taking elements from the first step in the second-set in buildings. All of the first element that corresponds a have to come from the first set and there's only one element in the first step. So the cross product of the set 0 the set containing 0 and the second is just this to Tuple continuing to run one has the option that produces the set above and it's the only option I put them in a different in different orders here because I wanted to emphasize that I don't want to say it doesn't matter but represents the same set the set written in set notation is one zero is equal to the set written and set notation a 01  Both of these two sets of zero in one available so we can generate all of these combinations 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 from the cross product of these two cents any other options, but I also don't work. Abby wouldn't let us generate either. So be is wrong because be would not let us generate either of these two elements in the cross product cuz there's no one in the first set and then D is actually representing sort of the same two sets just at the cross products in the order as a because when we write duplicates and set notation wee-wee the set doesn't actually ever have duplicates in it. I'm so really the set that we written in d-11  Is equal to the sac containing just 1 and 0 0 is equal to the sac containing destira reminders about and also this new idea that we use in class at all before of these Cartesian product built up from his other sets.  Any questions about any of the notation on this slide for sensory be starting to use that's more in class. So I just want to have this is a reminder notation and take any questions you have before going on.  Okay, so I want to use this idea of Cartesian products and related to products now, so I want to take talk about two numbers at the same time. So let's think about a predicate that takes a tutu full or an ordered pair of two values X and Y when X and Y are both even in the question I want to ask is what are some interesting domains or what are possible domains for us to use to describe. This predicate has a domain is it to Triple X and Y has to come from some domain. How can we describe that domain in English or symbolically keeping in mind. We have this new idea Asian products around you represent represent the domain of this predicate.  What are some domains we could talk about for this predicate?  Okay. So what are some suggestions from this section of the classes section all the way to my right discussions you had about possible domains for this predicate this predicate that's on the screen.  domains  domain someone from the front half of this section. So these fees for rose ideas for the domain.  Someone from the front half of the front half of this section over here. What are some ideas you had for the domain of this predicate?  It's just going to get smaller someone from the right-hand side of the front half of the front half. What are some ideas for the domain of this product could be the domain?  All real numbers ideas. Maybe we were talking about all real numbers. Awesome. Awesome Sol real number.  How does somebody from the second I just passed everyone out over there. So let's go there this section. I'm so tell me more. Tell me more. Are there other options is all real numbers what you wanted to use. What else did you discuss?  maybe two sets  so you guys are all interesting candidate idea. What do you want to say any more about which stuff?  Before we were yours.  So just that maybe one set for the x's and one set for the wise. Is that the other ideas?  coincide  the set of all even numbers  other ideas other ideas  So I'm writing the time symbol of the cross symbol hear the Cartesian product symbols and you're saying it we want the Cartesian product between integers integers and we often write the integers with the double thick line in the middle notation. We Works a little bit for managers interesting ideas.  All of these are reasonable things to be talking about and the set of all real numbers is another one we can talk about we can talk about for example, we often write the set of all real numbers a fake leg on the big leg of the are although I do that or the domain of aren't single number. So these pair of numbers has ordered pair that suitable of numbers so it might be interesting to talk about this having a domain. That's the cross product of all the real numbers with all the real numbers of to two poles are a set of ordered pairs during the cross product hear the set of all even numbers is interesting to think about again, if we just had a set of numbers that sort of doesn't match the input to the predicate so we might have to talk about the set of all even numbers cross the set of all even numbers in order to be talking about a set of tuples the key thing here is that this kind of description  the domain these two things talk about  of  in particular to two poles and hear what we're saying when we write down and then this to pull in parentheses is that  must be a set some set of two bowls and we can talk about what numbers were interested in talking about in terms of even this year. Whether were interested in the integers or positive integers are real depending on the problem. We might need a specific set of number that we do we want to talk about but the main point here is we would have to talk about this set of tuples to two bowls of numbers for this to make sense with this notation. There is no reason why in this problem managers vs. Reals is particularly more right than the other but we have to be talking about that's up to two poles for this notation to make sense. I want to do another example of going to have a similar flavor with two positions in the predicate. So let's have this predicate but I wrote It's called T Len and the meaning of Peel n on a two-pole s&n. Is that the DNA strand s has links and so it's true exactly when the DM  Has the length of this input and so when I asked the same question again, what what is a reasonable domain for us to describe for this predicate? How would we describe the set of two poles that we could use as Arguments for this product or as inputs to discredit? What are domains for this predicate?  alright, so what are some suggestions here for the domain lead used to describe this predicate feel in this length predicate, maybe someone from the left hand side of this middle section here are some suggestions for domain of this predicate the domain  domain  maybe there be some kind of to play some kind of people within a tuple talk about the structure of this strand plus the structure of combining with his number from this this half of this middle section other ideas for the domain of this domain of this product. Like we had four other ways. You said you talked about representing the domain  So maybe there's some sort of structure especially we talked about double helix has that makes there be some kind of even number and this year has been just a single strand of One-Eyed ameritemps thinking about the structure of the strands other ways people thought about the domain of this domain here.  Set of non-negative integers cross the set of non-negative integers. So again, we have these two these two two numbers put together an ordered pair.  Maybe the cross product of all possible DNA strands with all non-negative integers is all of these are useful ideas look like for the predicate in the bunch of tables and we talked about what all the inputs could be and then we talked about having these predicate columns that produce true or false.  And so if we have inputs that are strands and numbers friends number people's that's what this predicate is talking about. We need to refer to a DNA strand and it's length is a number then the inputs are going to be things like the DNA strand a and maybe let's say the number one.  That's an example of something that could be an input to this predicate and this particular case. We would expect that to produce true because this DNA strand has exactly one.  Here's another example in put another example and put is a and I'm not doing this in any particular order. I'm just coming up with some ideas of what example inputs could be here. Another example could be an actual. It's just my handwriting doesn't do the font differently. So it's not use T here and bases in it. And the first thing is a DNA strand and the second thing is some kind of number that relates to its link. So in this case what I would expect to see as describing these to Seth well, we can say something like  Of all DNA strands, which we've defined a few times now.  And let's say the S is the set of positive.  integers  And ask cross.  Is a good description of the kinds of inputs we have here but it definitely makes DNA strands of the first elements in these two poles and some kind of number as the second element needs to be some kind of interesting other ideas that came up like maybe nothing to Apples or maybe talking about the evenness of the length and I think I might decide truth or false based on like if it had to be even length of the predicate the kinds of values the predicate works over are these ordered pairs of strands and then some number that's what's described here. And then we can talk of a strand and a number.  Is the predicate true or false?  So this is like this is a kind of predicate. We'll talk about I want to make one other point based on what we've said here, which is that this particular predicate doesn't have a fixed size table for it cuz we didn't say anything about how long is friends can get this is an example of a table that doesn't have a fixed I so that's worth pointing out about this list of tuples is just going to keep going talking about all the positive integers such interesting about this practice.  I want to make one notational point before we go on in the book in life in math. And in this class. There is an abuse of notation that happens. We often write this thing on the left.  To avoid the extra set of parentheses. When we write this thing on the right that I've been writing on the last two slides P parentheses parentheses that the predicate is taking a tuple as an argument and working over the Tuple the notation on the left sort of makes it a little easier to type and maybe a little easier to read by omitting a set of parentheses. But what it means is a Pisa predicate in X and Y is a is a tuple there. So I just want to be clear that when we write predicate uses a predicate and we just use a single set of parentheses with, separated values. They're usually going to mean this to pull base interpretation on the right in this is an abusive notation that happens all over the place in math functions are often defined to take two bulls when they take multiple arguments and people don't write the two sets of parentheses around them, but that's what it means.  Unemployment start using the notation on the left without the extra set of parentheses for the rest of the lecture, but we're going to understand that this means that he takes a tuple.  So let's talk about some examples of this. I want to talk about restricted example here where I'm going to take this that in this example that's on the front of the worksheet says, what's what s to S Sub to be the set of DNA strands that just have lengths one or two and then let N be 0 1 2 and some just picking a really restricted set a subset of what we talked about on the last side where we talked about all DNA strand and all positive integers. And so we can imagine listing use out since I have the zero Rose there for a t g c and then I started listening on other Rose a question I have for you to think about as you're building up an understanding of this this domain.  How many rows are going to be in this table? If we take this input to be elements of the set s to cross and as I've defined up here, how many rows are going to be in the stable talk about this briefly. And then how many rows are going to how many rows will be here?  Okay how to do any suggestions for how many how many rows do you think will be in this table Yeah 60 other suggestions.  Suggestions other than 60 60 60. So for each one of these values of n we have to talk about all of the pair's we could generate with each one of the strands that are in the set and the strands that are going to be a t g c two letters. So all these other ones like aat and so on and this is going to be sixteen combination for bases and there's two positions the 16 combinations of putting them in order. There were four that were one length. So that's 20 different strands that we can do it better to and then we'll have a pair that we create for each one of those strands fries value of n so we'll have this 20 of hearing 3 * 1  Hang out with every possible stranding is set paired with every possible number in 01 to weed get a total of 60. And so the answer to can we wish them all is absolutely size table fits going to have six zeros in it.  So let's talk about some examples of using this of using this definition for a particular predicate. So there's this refer to refer to your worksheet for this which is that would appear in the Strand in if that number is equal to the input and then a predicate produces true. Otherwise, it produces false.  So the idea here is that we're going to be able to talk about Witnesses for this based on counting numbers at 8. I'm so I'm writing out this statement there exists such that the predicate for the count of Azor number of a size of TV is true. So which of these is a witness for that which of these is a witness?  5 4 3 2 1  just going to do a second round. That's really short.  Okay Quicken again Quicken again.  Curry 5 4 3 2 1  okay, so there were a fair number of people who answered a  And I agree with it on there is one a base appearing in the The Strand GA and the number is one. So this is definitely a witness for their existing it to where the predicate evaluates to true.  Once I get this next one.  So the predicate says the number given is equal to the count of the number of A's and the Strand in the Strand Gigi. There are no ways. There's 0/8 + 0 equal to that count today. Is that appear in that strand? So this is also a witness for this property described by TV number of ace.  See you in a little bit interesting. It's the count is wrong. So we definitely can't use this as witness the value isn't he will talk about Seymour in the next question indeed account would have to be two for this to be the answer here is more than one of these.  Because this is a and b both a and b a r a.  Another question is what's a counterexample for this and I'm just using a little bit different notation in the fur all here in one of two ways. Sony exists here. I named the two the two parts of the Tupelo s&n. So I would read this as thrall two bowls of snn number that he counts of a, bassinet is true. So I just I just talked back and forth. I just wanted to show that there's these two styles of the way we can unpack for two full and talked about both parts of it this question, which of these is a counterexample for this predicate.  five four  3 2 1  Okay 5 4 3 2 1.  alright, so  On the main thing. I want to highlight here. I'm we know that these aren't counter-examples because they're Witnesses for the other version of this essential version of this and know their true here is on is on see which is interesting because why is he why is he particularly interesting fact about sea makes a really interesting example to look at?  It might exist in another set S3 that talks about DNA strands of length 1 2 or 3. That's  It is not in the domain of Pete, right? There's two ways. Maybe we can build a bigger set that contains it but in particular GGG.  is not  ns2. So this example of GGG one that ordered pair is not in the domain of the P count today. It's not in the domain of this predicate and counterexamples have to come from the domain of the predicate. We can make up other values that aren't in the domain and say I found a counterexample domain so I can't say hey my predicate works over positive numbers and then you say I found a negative number when it doesn't work, right that would really defeat the purpose of me carefully to finding the domain of the predicate in this ended in nothing right for things in your homework. You have examples where free where you have say Win 4 numbers are with 2 numbers. You can't say. Hi. I found a three number that breaks the property because that's simply outside the domain of discourse for that problem.  C is not a counterexample C is simply something that cannot be an input to pee wee can't talk about the results of pee on GGG, once it's simply not in the domain evidence for a counterexample. We have to make sure that the element were looking at is in the domain of a predicate we're working with so the only answer is here is the account that's given in the ordered pair is only one and so that's the only counterexample out of these four.  Okay.  So actually wanting pause here any questions about this predicate P town today or about the Cartesian products or about the new notation does newt start a new topic coming on so many questions before we go on about any of us.  All right. So the next thing I want to introduce is this idea that we can take these quantifiers exists and for all and we can mess them so I can go a quantifier expression or Quantified expression can go inside and for all their existing account services in acid is equal to an that's how I would pronounce there's some number such that the Strand has two ways of reading it the first way I read it was like the way I just read out the math for all ask there exists such that the predicate for counted on asses on s&n is true. And the second is there's some number such as the Strand has that number base.  And so we can talk about what this means in a couple of different ways.  One thing we can do in this works for nested quantifiers where we have a fixed size table like we do in this example, cuz we're talkin about the domain of this predicate being just the strands of length 1 and 2 and just the values of n that are 0 1 and 2 we can think about this is saying we need this existential statement to be true. And so that means we need to write down as existential statement there exists an N for every possible value of strands in the domain and then and then together we have a big hand for the existentialist to be true. When the Strand is a lot to be true. When the Strand is the existentialist be true and it's for each possible value all the way up to CC at the very end which would be the last row in the order. I was writing things down. We have to find an n  And we can find a different n for each one of these is one of the crucial things about the way this is written these different existential don't have to use the same value of n there's a different size are each part of the end and we could find a different value for each one. So one way I like to reorganize the table we had before is to think about the table we get for each value do we could have signed to ask so this is basically taking that big and up there and just using it as a a way to reorganize the stable. So there's a bunch of problems here and he can still possible assignment of s and then all the rows in that column are going to be the inputs. Whereas his fix to that value of a strand and then we'll talk about all the values of n  So we can start feeling some of this end. So this is on the back of your worksheet the table for this and we can start feeling some of this in for this first spot here where we have the Strand a and the value in is equal to zero out. What's what's the truth value here.  And the interesting thing about this way of laying this out.  Is that what we start looking for?  Is we're asking this exists question for each one of these smaller tables. So what we start looking for his can we find a true somewhere? He needs one of these smaller tables and if we can find a true somewhere in every single one of these tables then we justify the exists for every possible input and a true then one of the existing up there would be false in the whole thing would be false.  No, it's interesting to note that this table doesn't have any new information it relative to the old table. We drew there's still going to be 20 of these big columns where we have because we had 20 different possible values for the strands and then each column has the three rows one for each possible value of end table total. We just reorganizing them and then we can talk about the same idea of finding a witness in each one of them.  That's one order in which we can put the for all which forces us to talk about this big and exist in each of those for each of those assignments to the first variable, but we can also talk about that some number such that for all strands. The predicate is true. So so the short English reading of this would be for some number all strands have that number of Ace for some number all strands of that number base. I filled in pretty decent chunk of the table for this one even more on your worksheet. And the question I have is for the other one we had this symbolic form.  What was the symbolic form be here? Like, what would what would the symbolic form look like for putting this together? Think about what the meaning of the statement is whether you think the statement is true or not and how you did how you would write this out symbolically to talk about this for a minute. What's the symbolic form of this ordering where we do the exist and then for all  Okay some suggestions. What's this? What is the symbolic form of this look like related to the in the same sort of spirit is the symbolic form of the last example what this look like.  Yeah, they exist of the existential.  With the upside down a the for all of the universal.  Okay. So on the last one we had it would have been exists and for all and then we have of the number of days and then we had these different strands in here. And then and then you said and then for all and number of A's and then we have the next thing in order and then.....  Interesting. So you're saying that you want to make this the different Clauses how to fix value of n not a fixed value of the Strand interesting interesting. So that's a little different and it says we're going to not stay for all in here and not say a, and here but instead we're going to stay for all s s, and maybe 0 for the first value of N and not for All In  But for all of us and then we're going to have a sin the next value of n for all.  s + 2  so the idea here is that each one of these Clauses is saying we need to we would have a witness. If one of these Clauses were true because we're asking for for finding some end. So if there's some value of n where we can make all of the answers true then we have a witness for this existential of the thrall.  Each of the four alls and I'm saying every values true because in each of the four alls we would need to have the entire result column be true for the four all to be true from this table that each of these columns for n equals 0 in equals 1 + n equals 2 has a counterexample already. So this is not true. We can definitely see that this is not true. There's counterexample for example here for an equal zero here for any pools one here for any close to and there's many more until this is not a true claim we can see it with our usual idea of listing things out and getting a counterexample the main point I want to make a predicate quantifiers on fixed sized domain is we can still use all the strategies reviews for listing things out.  I want to talk next about let me skip this for the moment. I want to talk next about doing this for the more General predicate. So talking about what these properties mean when they talk about all DNA strand and all and all positive integers instead of restricting ourselves to be short DNA strands and just be under 0 1 and 2 every DNA strand. There's some DNA strand that can be paired with it to make a double helix. What predicate do we need here? If we wanted to turn this into a symbolic form and what's its domain and then we'll talk about domain any suggestions right off the top of your head to go to this a little bit faster than giving tons of discussion times.  What predicate and what does doe mean?  Search suggestion for the predicate is some predicate. Maybe we call it H & H needs to take two strands when I call them as one as too and it means that S1 and S2 make a double helix, and we can copy the symbolic definition of double helix from the definition if we wanted but the predicate we need and it still mean would be all all strands cross all strands where s is the set of all DNA strand which one of these symbolic forms at the bottom for these nested these nested quantifiers would match. So as soon we have this predicate in each domain is as process which matches this description of the predicate for every DNA strands are is a DNA strand.  5 4 3 2 1  Just got this. This is actually worth worth a little bit of discussion.  Okay picking again and again.  5 4 3 2 1 Okay, so  The answer here is C.  And it's important to distinguish Sea from what some of the others might mean. So in some of the other ones what this would say is for every DNA strand.  it makes  a double helix with every other DNA strand.  And that we can definitely think of counterexamples for off the top of her head and doesn't match this statement that we were going for right? It's for all where there should be in exist in this position in Indy would be saying there exists some strand as to such that it is makes a double helix with every other DNA strand that exists to fix this one DNA strand and then try to match it against every other one so we can convert these things from English into these statements, but the different ordering that we take for the quantifier really change the meaning they change the way we organize that table  That's that's all I wanted.
