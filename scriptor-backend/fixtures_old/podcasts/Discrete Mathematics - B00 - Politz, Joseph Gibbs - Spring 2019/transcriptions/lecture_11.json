    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast. Actually, would you mind just calling the number on there and telling them the projector doesn't work for me while I get started?  That's frustrating.  Yeah, just call it is one of the numbers there.  Oh, okay.  Okay, let's get started. So I'm going to try and run this without the projector cuz it doesn't seem to be working. So thankfully we have a worksheet. So a lot of the things we need around here.  What I want to talk about today are two specific thing. So one is working with negating some of the Quantified Expressions. We've been working with existentialism news for all we haven't done a real investigation of what happens when we put in the gation in front of them and I want to start talking about how we can prove or demonstrate Truth for having these tables that aren't fixed size or on finite and we weren't able to talk about all the rose.  Well recap a little bit.  Just by saying there are two proof strategies. We know pretty well already. I haven't called them proof strategies. We have been able to say that we can prove statements like this for all XP of Acts. We can prove these false.  with a counterexample  and statements like exist sex  We've been able to prove.  true  weather wind  and those are two ways to give evidence that these statements are true. We've actually done a lot and we can prove a universal statement is false by giving a counterexample Essentials True by giving these Witnesses.  The hard part for the thing that's going to become interesting is when we have to prove that after all statement is is true or an existential is false. So when we want to prove something for all X  pfx or sorry  We're curious how to prove this true and how to prove this case false.  Is the two cases that are tricky for us. If we sort of laid these four cases out for you talking about when each of these cases is true or false. I want you to just try and describe an English when for all Lexus true and when exist sex is false, what does it look like what you think in English with no statements are true.  I think I'll just try plugging in again.  What's up?  Thanks for being with me. I don't know why it doesn't work today. So the negation of an existential if you want to prove that an existential isn't true to me in English.  There's no Witnesses. There's no Witnesses.  Contre-coup interesting, but it's a contradiction more ways to describe describe it.  more ways  Yeah.  Every value of the domain makes you text boss. You're going to say that while all of these are sort of reasonable things to use for discussion. It's helpful to say what's happening here when an existential is false as we want to stay for all the values in the domain we get asked for that predicate on that value in the domain. There's no place where this would produce true.  That's pretty interesting. Now if we want to prove it for all three, what did you put for proving up for all troop? Would you stay up here for proving it for all true?  proving a for all through  certain things did you say?  And know that here we express this one in terms of universal home we have to exist. Is there an existential we could use to express this?  There is not existed case where?  pxs Falls  do not exist in case  SRP of ex's fault that actually sounds like a counterexample.  And went down.  So this is kind of interesting because this tells us that there are no there doesn't exist any examples. There's some rules and identities for moving around between 4 oz and existential here to write all the answers for the question until the slide works on to something else. One of the point here is that we are able to think of these as Duels of one another in many ways when we're looking for things to be true in Africa.  So you can if we if we start a tried to push negations through we might be able to find hear that these two things on the top row or equivalent. If every bit screw for everything. Then there doesn't exist any more it's false. If you pushed simple rules for negation through the definitions in the book, you'll see that these are equivalent statements so that I want to move down. So I'm going to focus on stuff that's on your worksheet so you can see things that are on your work. So if you look on your worksheet, there's a couple of the set of integers. I'm also it's worth pointing out that the set of natural numbers in a spouse always contain zero and then about a few different  That's that we have I been abbreviating z+ so like the positive integers not including zero. I want to do a little bit of work with numbers today. So we have this definition at the bottom of your sheep in the idea in factoring is that were talking about when numbers evenly divided one another the definition of factoring says when A & B are integers a / B means there's an integer C such that beat. This is a statement about multiplying things together to get another number. So the thing I want to have you tried for a minute is there's this definition of a predicate.  There's two blanks there one is how you would write this symbolically, like what we would actually put if we wanted to have this be symbolic predicate and any other is what the domain of this just for a second.  Let's go with the symbolic part first. What would you write for a symbolic answer here? How would I write this out? If I wanted an expression using the mathematical expression, we've used Emoji right here to evaluate this symbolically.  to represent symbolically  play something from this side of the room.  Mary from the front half of the side of the room the back half of the back half of the represent the symbolically  factorable of a bee  Wow, that was really looking away. There's no eye contact.  I'm going to look at your suggestions any part of Italy part of it.  Behind me in this section right here.  See something. Okay. So I feel like a z plus talkin about positive integers.  Other symbolic ideas, I see for all that exists on some sheets walking around. I see for all of them exist interesting right part of the English statement here is says there is an integer C. There is an integer C is for all statement or an existing.  So there exists some sea exists on sea?  And I'm going to be really explicit about this C. I want to be precise some cases when we use existential in for all that's important to be pretty precise of a domain. We're taking the variable C from so just to be clear it says that there is an integer integer and what needs to be true. Once we've chosen some see needs to be true about that once we've chosen it.  It has to be some see such that.  Some see such that what's in the definition?  I heard Whispers. I heard Whispers that look like the wolf sounds like people are saying something in the definition. It says we need be to be equal to a Time CNA NC right next to each other in the definition of multiplication. If you want to be really explicit we could use like to talk about multiplication is equal to 8 times. There is some see such that we have this equation true is mathematically on integers this equation be true.  And then what's the domain of f what's the domain so the domain here with that so mean?  the domain here  see  Okay.  OC Saiyan God like a such that something they're interesting interesting. I like this idea of using Z. I mean the definition says when A and B are integers and a is non-zero, right? We could say answer you're saying maybe we wanted to find that a minister says integer is not positive integers for example right now. I might have a slide that's going to help us a lot.  There we go. There's one that's going to make our life easier domain of all the positive integers are the positive integers which rules and also makes it so we don't have to think about negative numbers, which is just nice.  And let's see.  I want to symbolically we can talk about this factoring predicate and it's going to start to be interesting to talk about this factoring predicate over sort of these entire internet domains overall number that's that's the kind of thing. I want to be able to say going forward. So there's a reason that we care about this factoring problem can be evenly divided number by another the I'm not going to worry we might get to the details of this algorithm later in the quarter knock enough time to talk about it in detail today is not really the intent of today's class but there's an idea in cryptography and her man who's taking photography right now can correct me on anything. I say that's a lie right now. If someone wants to make it possible for other people to encrypt data and send it to them. One of the steps in this process is publishing a really big number like a really big number that they got  Two primes together and the idea is the only entity that knows which primes they multiplied together to get that really big number and it's a lot of work for anyone else to figure out how to factor that big number into those primes. So I did that Amazon would publish the results of a x b and it would be a lot of work for anyone else to figure out what factors went into the individual values of A and B are factoring is hard when factoring is easy when factoring is possible useful useful questions to ask without everybody getting your credit card number. So it's worth paying attention to factoring. I want to do some simple problems with it and then build up my build up a bit of an understanding here.  So here's a couple different uses of this of this predicate of this factoring predicate with where I'm being careful in all of these cases is coming from coming from the Placer is one of the positive integers without approving any of these which one of these are true which one of these which one of these statements are true and keep in mind that you could be looking for Witnesses encounter examples for these based on to prove them not true.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick and again and again.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so I want to show I want to show the answer is here because there is we might be able to get some useful information from around the room because there's some sort of some votes for each of these and then some votes for none of the above for counterexample for many of these and one of the things that we could do for example to figure out if this is actually none of the above or not is we could find a counterexample or find something that makes any of all of the first ones not true and figure out where we need to do some more sophisticated arguments in that if we do.  So this first one folks it said that this was not true any reasons for why it's not true reason to believe it's it's not true. Why don't you pick pick something other than a  thank you.  interesting  So let me write it this way. Let me write out what you said in English because often times this isn't a formal argument.  It can help us get a little bit of intuition. So you're saying there is some.  integer  that is not  it's all not its own factor or doesn't factor with itself or isn't one of its own factors multiplied by a number to get itself.  Hey, go ahead run.  Pinterest thinks you're saying look I can always find you some evidence that that's a successful factoring and seems like it's going to be hard to ever find a number where that's not true especially for just thinking about positive integers. It seems really pretty clear years. Maybe we can * 1 what are the next one for all for all positive integers? It's not true that that integer is its own factor or factors inside herself examples of it. This is an example if it's not true.  So you're saying look I've I have an example for so you're actually making an argument from the first case you're saying if there doesn't exist something where this is true. It certainly can't be that it's true for all of the elements in the domain. Right? I think we can say is let's just pick a number is 2 a factor of itself to is definitely a positive integer and based on our definition. We're asking if you two could be true. So we have to find some C such that 2 is equal to 2 * C or two. I got on the board in here. And again, we could use a C equals one is some evidence for that for trying to prove that existential.  How about see? How does c relate to A & B C relate to A & B or how would you say si in English? Either way helps us answer this. How do you say si in English actually?  Good practice turn to the person next to you and Stacy to them in English. To say it to me.  Any suggestions for how you want to read CI the way I want to read CD but any suggestions for how you wanted to read see the not before for all those little tough to pronounce sometimes yet.  So interesting, you're saying it's like the same as a like the same as a that's interesting us actually using one of these identities about negating across a quantifier. If we negate across the floor all we can start a push it inside and talk about it being an existential of the negation. So you might say for this one day. I mean that's it doesn't quite read that sentence in English, but it's right. You're right. It is equivalent to what it says.  There is not exist.  What causes static in eating?  Interesting. Yes, and they're not all true is actually a pretty nice summary. So the fur all says for all the integers this week. It would have this predicate F would have to be true for each one of them. I'm in Anderson. In front. So it's not the case that for all integers is predicate holds that's pretty interesting and we can talk about it in similar ways that we talked about.  4D again, we've got another use of one of these negation identities and D is related to beat by one of the negation identities. So none of these in Factor trip, we can find Arguments for or counter examples for Witnesses for all of them the arguments though. We haven't figured out how to make particularly formal yet.  These arguments like the argument for a where a is an existential and we're trying to show that it's not true. So it's not like we found a witness for a are we made this argument but there's no way we can possibly find this integer so that we can make that argument more formal and also that we were saying while we were building up this understanding of the factoring predicate is really that it seems like the factoring predicate on the same number. So the statement for all AF of AA is actually true for all the numbers cuz we could always use this factor of Cedar X it and find find some evidence for it. And so there's this idea of constructing this kind of argument counterexample choosing an element.  We're going to call. The only thing we assume about is that it comes from the domain with only the domain we have Quantified variable X. The only thing we assume is that it came from and we'll just use that information to show the case of our the statement on the last slide that statement is  The positive form of that statement would be for all.  And being precise about the domain here just so we don't make any mistakes thinking about the domain that is in.  z+  this product should be true. We'd like to show his true.  so we can  assuming arbitrary  e that's in this domain.  and what we want to show is that ffe must be true and all we know about is that it is  In this domain of positive integers.  And then we have to do what we have to do. Next is we want to show f a v e and we have a definition for f here so we can talk about this using the symbolic form of this definition for f in order to in order to demonstrate that because we want to show that no matter the value of 4 positive integers. We can make ffbe true. So  by the definition  F we know that if we can show there exists some see  Such that we live in now I'm filling an e-4 both A and B in the predicate just substituting in that value in the symbolic form of the predicate if we can show that there exists equally X see then we will have demonstrated and so we can find this Witness.  of C equals 1  That's a suggestion that was made earlier as well. We can fix equals one here. If we feel C equals 1 into this equation. Will you can just multiply 8 by 1 and see that equals and that makes the entire existential be true. So we found a witness to the existential is true. We've demonstrated that the existential is true which demonstrates the ffe is true and all we had to know here is that we could do basic arithmetic and algebra of picking C equals 1 in multiplying and all of that works for the values of either positive integers. I'm so this is successfully demonstrated what we wanted to show.  I want a pop-up table that relates to how we have looked at this before with cables because we just read what I just said is we use the definition of f we assume we had an arbitrary Element TV from this domain and positive integers. And then we the definition had an existential so we had to use a witness to show that existential was true.  Don't turn the tables we've had so far. They claim we were making is that for all a in the positive integers FAA is true definition of f and we can think of this just like the tables we've been drawing where we have the input a counting up one two, three four and for each input there's this statement we have to demonstrate every single time if we substitute that a value into the definition we can find a witness for it. It happens in this proof that we picks equals one and every single time the witness one works to demonstrate that this is true and we can demonstrate that FAA is true.  the thing the proof does that we weren't we didn't have a way to talk about before is now if I give you some arbitrary row of this table and I say  tell me about the row where a is equal to 547.  The proof tells us how to fill in this entire row at the proof will say well you will need to show this existential your pixie equals one and it'll work out because of how just arithmetic and algebra work on integers. We're going to be able to run this process through and end up with a true over here.  And so though the thing we get out of a proof. So this these statements of the proof.  Is kind of like a way to generate a row of our table for an arbitrary input. So anytime we have some arbitrary in put something that's in the positive integers disprove. Tell someone how to generate the next row in the table or the row in the table for that element.  And this is the kind of argument we need to make in order to justify the true side of Afro statement. We really want to justify that aperol statement is true. We have to show how it's going to work for any possible role the table and produce a true net protocol.  So this is called proof by generalization idea. Is there any proof that start by saying we will assume some arbitrary element from the domain and it's a good way to prove for all statements. We basically only get to make assumptions about the domain and we're trying to generate all these roads.  That's a big new idea to take a minute to talk about talk about that idea what the person next to you and come up with any questions. You have any observations? You have no idea about it for a minute questions that you have then we'll do some more examples.  Okay questions observations about this idea of using this arbitrary elements idea to prove this statement the idea that generate a row of this table questions here.  Yeah.  Waltz of the the key thing here is the thing that lets us do that is  That all we assume about he is that it came from the domain that we picked for the for all statement. And so if we don't make any other assumptions about me, like I say this works because he's even or this works because he is a multiple of 7 or something like that. I chose. I didn't make any assumptions positive integer. And what happens to work well because there is this property if you multiply 1 by a number that you get the number if this property or something else like every number is equal to 2 times itself. We wouldn't be able to we wouldn't be able to demonstrate that all I use is that he has some integer. There's As Nice property of integers that if we multiply them by 1 and if I didn't use any extra information other than it was from the domain, that's the guarantee along with making a logically consistent argument.  Because any element that's in any row of this left-most column for a that's the only criteria for not calling. And so if we only assume that then that's enough information to push the whole argument through.  other questions  Yeah.  not  That's a great question. So in this case in this proof, the witness is always one. Right and that's because in the proof we said the witness that were using for evidence is this equals one case we could imagine other proofs of other properties are the witness might depend on the input somehow right? And then maybe the witness would be different in every call him it would depend on the right. You can imagine that for that the witness might be different in cases where like we were trying to prove something is another number divided by two or something. So there could be proofs changes depending on the input since we just picked.  Yeah.  Right. So that's where we would need to say something. Like I'm trying to think of a simple enough example off the top of my head to demonstrate it.  You might want to say something like for every number there exists for every positive number there exists a negative number where if you add them together, right that might be an interesting thing to talk about as a property and we kind of believe that might be different for every row because for the number of the positive number three, the witness would be -3 for the positive number for the witness would be -4 and so on so that would change we can calculate the witness call him from the input right before all would be over all the positive integers and I would have to be a math expression that works on any possible positive integer and then end up working with the particular input.  And we the important thing is that the constructs that when this we only knew that the input was a positive number nothing else about it.  So I could imagine in some witness columns you would want to write to witness columns to think about this one, which is an expression that uses something based on the input in the case about positive negative times negative one I could imagine witness Collins with a bunch of Expressions. There is basically what I'm getting up.  Good questions. Good questions.  The key idea here is one way to think about a proof or at least this kind of proof by generalization is you're describing a process to generate an arbitrary row of this table guaranteed to have enough evidence true in the rightmost column is in terms of the tables. We've been drawing so far and let us extend. These arguments could really be taken from an infinite domain.  So this is mostly just a reminder of some of the properties that we we saw earlier that we have this relationship between negations of cool.  Sounds good. Then we have this relationship between vacations of universals indications of existential in this bottom case if we have a interesting thing to note here is in the bottom case. We have a knot of an existential that rewrites for all statements. But these are these are identities we were using in the beginning of class to talk about those statements synergist are interesting and useful things to be aware of I want to ask a question related to them. This is really sort of practice working with some of these definitions because they're going to be important when we  Go on to doing proofs that interesting implications and conjunctions in them. So I want you to use these to talk a little bit equivalent of these Quantified statements using these these couple of properties and you have these properties on the back of your feet. So it's not like they were just there for a second. You have a slide. Do you have the properties written on the back? So if you want to use those to answer these go for it.  5 4 3 2 1 discuss this thing we do discuss this in all open it up again in a minute.  Okay clicking again with answers after discussing this.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay. So many people said today was a was not true. What's a counterexample for a what's a what's some input values that clearly make?  Okay, my make a not work. If we thought about different values we could have for p and Q. "
