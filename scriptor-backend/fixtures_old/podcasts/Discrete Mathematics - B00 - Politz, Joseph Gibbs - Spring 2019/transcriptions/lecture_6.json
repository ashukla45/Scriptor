What are we doing Wednesday?  What was that?  It's what we talked about. What? Yeah, go ahead.  one compliment to Scotland over those for  Binary, what would 4 in binary we talked about last Friday to what were the what were these representations for negative numbers? And then we ended with something new or did we end with logic gates? We talked a little bit about how we can take some of these operations that we might want to do. We talked a little bit about taking some of these operations that we wanted to do. I'm binary numbers. I've been putting them into putting them into the symbolic representation of some of these ones and zeros interpreted not just as numbers, which is what we've been doing so far we're going to need to do I'm just a quick reminder want to make sure it because we have all these deadlines in this class. I want to make sure I'm listening everytime. We have a deadline the homework for homework 1  Going to be do Monday night and last night the follow-up zero and warm up for one of the other warm up or do I just want to be clear that Thursday night those deadlines are happening and that homework is going to be due next Monday.  All right, if I want a quick just put up a slide that we had up on on Wednesday. I mean this was one of our first examples of doing and so we had at least two inputs that we talked about x 0 & Y 0 and we had these two outputs want and I said the S was representing some and see was representing the Carrie and the idea was that we had to represent all that information. And so I just want to draw an S for one second to talk about the relationship between some of these inputs and outputs that come out just to show it on the wires because we didn't really draw it at the end of class on Wednesday. And so I just want to be clear about that second 0 & Y 0  And so we can locate those rows in these tables on the right hand side. So these are the rows where X 0 & Y 0 0 and 1 and then we can read off what's happening for a 0 which is the result of the Sexes or gate that produces of one because these values are these values are different in this table is showing us that this gate is producing these one values.  And we can also look at this row and see that what'll happen in the year when we have the zero and one for the input is it will get a zero coming out for the Carrie really? What I wanted to do here is just visually map what's going on in these tables. We saw on to the circuit diagram where we left off on Wednesday was we were talking about doing more and more Edition cycada adding more than one bit because this is talking about the one bit some. I'm actually there's some things I want to example. I want to talk about a few other small examples first today.  I'm with this in mind. I want to bring up some of these some of these some interesting pictures that we can draw with some of these Gates even if we just have one one input variable this also get that some things that we can draw or allowed to draw with give us some interesting some of these two pictures on the bottom left when I have is a single input variable called X and then X the the wire coming out of X has been split and there's two inputs going into a gate into input. I'm going into an xor gate and both of those both of the input City's gate. So what is the truth table? And what is the input output table end up looking like  Table word. Is it where we're going to start using today? I'm pretty sure these two simple Gates. What is a table look like for these two simple case?  All right. So let's talk through let's talk through these two cases because they're actually going to give us some interesting insights that we can use to build up some larger thing.  So in the first case we have X's the input and an X. The input is being used as both of you. And so if x is 1 if x is one then there's these two inputs coming into the end gate that are both one. We can consult the and table that we have at the top and if both  And similarly if both values are zero, which is going to happen if we duplicate the sex we get to zero here.  For the xor gate if the input is X what's the what's the output according to this table feel if the input X is one what's the output according to this table?  Going to be zero because we're going to end up insulting that top row in the x or table table. We're both values AR-10 will consult this bottom row. We're both of the valley is coming under 0  So mainly this picture is useful for us notation Ali because when we have these logic circuits, we will be doing this operation. We take the wire for some variable split it and use it as in multiple places and we are allowed to use it. I use those most a couple of interesting questions to play with logic circuit. And so the first question this is a question. That's why whose output is always zero and one thing to think about is can you do it with just one gate? There's also ways to do it with more than one gate to try this try drawing out drawing out a little logic circuit. It's going to always put the values of X and Y and has these two inputs X and Y.  Yeah, I just want to hear from you.  Alright, so any suggestions for how to do this? No matter how many gates I'm not necessarily looking for a one Gate 1 gate solution first time suggestions. The people had yeah.  So two branches from one value going to an exclusive or gate interesting. So I think you're suggesting a one gate solution or saying there's b x and y and tell me which value you want this splitting happen on.  I have like two exclusive or gate.  So maybe there's been maybe there's some chain process. I'm just going to undo a few of the lines that I drew and take more suggestions. Could I think that you were going to suggest a good to great solution and I think I saw some other people catching something like that. So when I get more sleep,  Okay.  Baldwin High School  And then one of them.  What are the first?  It's intended. First of all, I didn't make any mistakes Euros instead of Truth and false has just cuz we're using ones and zeros for the comment you made it is if we put X and Y into and the edge coming out of the wire coming out of and this could only be one if X and Y were both one. So the only way this could be one as if X and Y were both one and then is final and would end up producing a zero and we could draw and Trace through the circuit for all of the possible in and check. This one works. I haven't done all the work to check it right, but I'm pretty sure this one works. It seems like that argument hangs together, but we have to do more checking to be sure.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then I'll go.  So you can connect your saying the here's another idea is X and Y and you said connected to an and gate.  and then you said take the output of this and connect it to  I was like a really cool spaceship. All right, so I knew said then connect both so we can take one of these wires split it in and put it is both of the input.  It wouldn't matter what the first gate is interesting.  It wouldn't matter what you're saying. I can take any gate in substituted in here interesting cuz you tell me more about that argument.  Yeah, so we so we sort of saw in the last line that if we connect the same input up to an xor gate if we put him in putting connect it up to an ex are always getting 0 out of the xor gate because that same that's the same going to be the same value on both inputs. That's pretty interesting. So this idea of doing it now that we've seen this  You want to suggest a solution that only uses one gate? Yeah.  At least with the Gaithers. So you're saying at least with the gates we've seen so far. You don't see any dates that has all zeros in the rightmost column, right? You don't see one of those so it's not clear which one we could use. I want to give I want to give an answer to this that makes it feel like maybe this was a trick question.  Interesting. Okay. So you predicted the sort of answer that could turn this into feeling like a trick question, which is let's just and have X going into  and xor gate why doesn't why doesn't have it isn't used as an input or output is described by the  interesting. That's a good question. So you're saying you want to draw circuit. We're sort of the wires from X and Y come together into one shared wire and then go into the xor gate so great question. So in these logic circuits that we're drawing the only way we can go from two values down to one is by using some kind of date to combine them which gives us the rules for combining putting two wires together. Then we we need some rules to talk about what the value on that wire could be in the gates are the way that we reduce down trick answer to the version that just uses one input works because some parts of the circuit and it's interesting to talk about which parts of the input. We actually need to use or need to use for different parts of the circuit things.  So this this isn't a question. I'm asking in a total vacuum. It's actually useful for I'm building up some some larger and interesting circuit. So the next thing I want to talk about this drawing a logic circuit that implements multiplication by 4 in and there's a little bit more information on the two bits of input and four bits of output to represent the result of multiplying by 4. And useful to think about here is what the tables going to look like for this as you as you try to start building it up, but we do know that a big part of the construction here is that there's going to be an input for an input X next one and then 4 digits worth about what to represent this.  So think about this problem for a minute logic circuit that'll Implement multiplication by 4 that uses this structure. So filling in the gates in the middle on to do multiplication by 4 pack with this remote.  OK Google  So I hear some great questions going around. So I want to I want to give a few sort of helpful examples. I want you to keep thinking about this because there's two parts. This one is understanding basically how the problem in the structure is set up here the interpretation of what these wires and bits mean and in the other is building a circuit and so I want to I want to give some some guidance on interpreting this problem. There's these two input bits and I'm actually going to draw them in this order X1 and then x 0 because these are representing two bits of a with screw base to number and so for example, if we had zero zero that would represent the number zero zero one that would represent the number one if we had  1 0 that's representing the number two and one one is representing the number 3 represent with his two with binary representation.  And then we can talk about what we expect to get as the answer for those when multiplying by 4 and then sort of spread across 0 through Z 3 or the digits 0 through XIII.  Descending order so that when we read them off at all look like a binary number. So what's the what's the four bit result for multiplying 0 by 4.0 by 4.  all zeros all 0 so we should expect that if we have 00 the output of the circuit ends up being 0 0 0 0  If we multiply 1 by 4, what do we expect as the output?  What do we what do we expect the output to be as a decimal number just in the answer for arithmetic for right? And so we need to include that in these bits?  And actually we'll see if we do this out if we have 2 x 4 we would expect to get eight and if we have three x 4 we expect to get 12.  so  this some structure here in the expected output of the circuit, which is that it's sort of moving these bits over in the second row remove 01 / 2/3 + Z2 in NZ 1 + z 0 or zeroes. I'm in the same thing happened.  So that's pretty distinct. And also that's all the cases. There's no other values we can talk about for the inputs for X 0 and x 1. Those are the four cases that we need to think about the circuit that has exactly those outputs for these inputs is what we need to build. So I want you to take another minute with this structure in mind continuing to try and build this is this actually tells us a lot about what our goals are for building a circuit.  Okay, so I want to talk about this to get this circuit together now.  I see a lot of interesting ideas as I walk around and there's multiple ways to do this. So I'm going to show you I'm going to show you a way that I think is reasonable to do this and I'm curious. I'm curious if this is what you tried or was on sort of the endpoint of a path that you were trying. So one thing I want to observe right off the bat is that this comment about moving back to your own X One into the values of Z 3 + Z2 are we can represent the value of x ends up being the value of Z 3 without changing at all. This this input can go directly to this output.  x 0 always seems to go to  z20 always seems to end up in Z2, and then there's a question of what to get for Z 0 and Z 1 what we look at the the table Z 0 and Z Wonder always Eros. So that suggests we can use one of our ideas for producing consistency Rose here.  Producing consistency Rose here splitting Ness and producing an XR and that can be what goes into Z 0 and Z want so we always get but the X 0 and x 1 values move into the appropriate spots in the output.  Now this is one approach to doing anything else for for representing this.  Try anything else that they want to share for representing the circuit?  Yeah.  See you later ask you to ask that again, cuz I'm not sure I understood the question.  I see ya you're saying.  If we just drew nothing going into Z 0 and Z 1 for example, what's the answer? What's the interpretation of that circuit is a really good question. So this along with the wires joining up with a really good questions about this representation, and we're going to choose in our representation in the typical terms of some input. And so that's that's going to force us to come up with some wire that goes into each of the output bits. And that's going to be a constraint on the way. We draw these pizza.  Set the sort of a hardware reason why that is if you're good. If you have one of these I mean, you can't imagine building something that doesn't require that doesn't require this constraint that everything for consistency. If we were talking about lots of for bit for bit instructions and we were saying then doing something with Z100 Z1 Z2 and Z3 off to the other side we would want I have sort of a contiguous diagram that actually Drew from the input all the way to those other output. And so it's nice to have it always be in terms of those in Fort Myers.  So the question is if it's like a variable in code that's not initialize. I don't want to draw too strong of an analogy there because depending on the programming language you're thinking of his actual different kinds of meaning for uninitialized variable. So there's a sort of a light analogy there, but I don't want to draw too strong an analogy there between uninitialized variables and and something that doesn't have any anything coming into it cuz we're going to define the way we draw these to stay there have to be these wires coming into the output. Anyway. So one of these on this life you always have to precisely specify it.  So this is this is an interesting interesting observations to take from multiplying by 4 really was a shipping operation on the representation of this number. So the multiply 2 with numbers by for what did we do? We really shifted the bits over by two places that we shifted the values over by two places multiplied by 10 or a hundred or a thousand you shift the number over by a certain number of digits and then fill in with zeros from the right. And so this is just another one of these connections between what were used to in decimal arithmetic and arithmetic.  So any questions about the circuits we've seen so far. I'm going to start talking about some some newer things. I just want to ask any questions about the missing so far other outstanding questions about how we draw these diagrams.  the meaning of these diagrams  sea of happy faces  So there is so we we did this exploration of circuits in part to motivate some of the representations we had four binary which lettuce demonstrate that the binary representation the thing we can build into a physical machine. If you believe me that these gates are things that we can build into a physical machine. We're not going to talk about that in detail in this wonderful understanding how to take these kinds of diagrams and turn them into a real but I'm beyond expressing arithmetic. It turns out these Gates and some of the operations were talking about are also useful for expressing logical statements that say things about what's true. And what's false in knees are the same kinds of logical reasoning to make decisions about what to do. And so one of the things we  Going to be exploring we're going to use gates to explore the first we're also going to start to use Expressions to explore it expressed using Gates using English and using logical expressions and work with those and work with those representations.  Mom says a couple definitions here. I know there's a lot of texts on this line, so I'm not going to I'm going to read it all at once but I'm not going to expect at this is seared into your memory the first time you see it. I just want to make sure that these four terms are things that were aware of so we're going to use the word proposition 2 Min statements that could be true or false exactly 1 of true or false and we will have variables in these a propositional statement. I'm one reason I didn't want to make the strong programming language analogy is it we will have variables in the propositional statements and will want to talk about this proposition. I didn't want to think about that. They will be variables that think about replacing with true or false what would happen?  Find dates of operations like and an xor in order to combine things were going to use similar operations to combine them tables for Gates. What we're going to do is extend that to having true and false has in the table instead of just having ones and zeros in the table. I just think to make it to force us to think about this idea of true and false statements.  So we're going to start using some new notation to talk about to talk about some of these operations. And so the new notation is going to be showing up here.  And the new notation is going to let us write down these propositions in nice sort of either math texter in line in English, but they do correspond to skate that we've been talking about.  So we are going to see this correspondence between 0 and false in one in true and start writing keys. And I've seen these tables and the symbol or the hay without a crossbar is in the definition for and that's the symbol used to combine two propositions with an and then the the thing that looks like a cross hairs are a cross in a circle means exclusive or zeroes replace with have someone  What's a few more of these operations and I'll open this one up for you to fill in just in terms of some more vocabulary that you'll see book and you'll hear I'm and we call a conjunction and there's another operation that we haven't really used yet called disjunction which is what we usually think of is or in a programming language. And what I want you to do here is just reading the stable and thinking about this English definition Below in any experience you have thinking about vs. Exclusive or what's going to be the output for this Junction table. I'm reading from top to bottom. What are the what are going to be the true and false aliens for this table?  Just got this one first-round. I'm not going to do two rounds on this question.  five four  3  2  1  alright, so  the reason it's useful to put this up on a slide next to exclusive or or XR is just a highlight that these are two different operations where we have this is going to produce true here. And then anytime there's a true in either spot will get a True Result. The only time we get false is it both inputs are false bro wear false comes out for xor in truth comes out for me right at using this little V and sort of The Upside Down version of the M symbol and that's going to be the way we we write it when we write an expression.  And these are going to be sort of helpful building blocks and xor in or as we go forward.  I want to talk about one more. So how about this operation negation? How would you describe this operation in English this operation of negation in English. So we have these nice English descriptions of these coming along the bottom. How do you describe this one in English?  Lorazepam and just giving English description of this operation based on its table.  Swap interesting swap. So if if he can put the particular value swap into the other one other English descriptions use that word in to find it a little bit later toggle not all of these are all of these get it nice and nice high-level English descriptions of what we might mean here and not as interesting. I think all of these are pretty interesting we could also just say if p is true then it produces false if p is false that it produces true. That would be an English description.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  hip  yeah.  That's a great question. Yeah, so you're actually highlighting something about this picture down here right here is the triangle with a circle at the end and it only has one only has one input and that's an interesting thing about negation operators that take to operate only takes one that had multiple inputs because it sort of defined is this single unit operation but doesn't work on multiple operations said here. I like the idea of saying it's not you said because English description here.  We want to make this English description happen. So I like some of the words that I don't have a sentence that I think is the definition hear the song about one more one more interesting example of connecting things logically and it's going to introduce one kind of matter that we might want and so I said the propositions are going to be used to represent statements that could be true or false and if useful to use these kinds of proposition reason about statements we might make about systems about Computing systems whenever the system  Two propositions that we could see in that sentence with the messages scan for viruses and the other is and I want you I'm going to do two rounds on this question. I want you to think about it alone first and then I want you to talk about it cuz there's actually some really interesting discussion to have about how we want to express this which one of these logical statements are these propositions below matches this if we picked it as his this scanning for viruses and you is Central Time in system. So which one of these is the idea of what's described in English there when we have Disconnected by this this idea of something happening whenever something else happens.  The bgpp do the silent first round want to silent first round for everyone's first opinion for this one.  We're at a silent a silent first-round a silent first round. I just want to open it for like another couple seconds and then you then you can discuss.  5 4 3 2 1  okay, I noticed  Alright picking again with the results of talking about this with the folks around you or reflecting on this a little bit.  5 4 3 2 1  okay.  All right, so I want to show the answer to this I wanted book before I did. I just want to be clear. This is going to be a case where we have to agree on what some language means my talking through some examples of an English sentence. I I can't really tell you that it's the right answer because of some incredible mathematical truth, which is why I'm using this example of what folks in the class was a popular answer both before and after discussion that it was and was it we did no one changes their mind.  People went away from me people went away from bee and maybe those people went towards the and maybe yeah, okay and maybe towards the okay, but that but no one change their mind away from a the people who are the people who or at least the same number of people, I guess people could have slept in and out of these categories. So people who answer key. Do you want me to write something else other than the four options that are here. Do you want some other some other statement? Yeah.  So you are or s?  conjunction and S  you and us new Anda. So that's interesting because we could ask about comparing the results of you and S2s and you and one thing would notice if we looked at the we look at the table for these we look at the table for an the order of the the two variables end up not mattering cases in the same assignments.  You're looking for if you then s interesting. Is that similar to what you were going to say? Yeah, you really where's the one that says if you  Then ask Joe you didn't teach us about this one yet. Where is that one in this list? Cuz I don't even think it's barely a majority picked a lots of folks who thought. These other interpretations might make sense going to be important for us to think about any savings that are kind of used Benz or whenever is it Concrete in this example about be scanned for viruses if it wasn't sent from an unknown.
