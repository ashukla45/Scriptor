    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  All right, let's get started. Happy Wednesday everybody. So today what we're going to do is extend what the kinds of things we can do with logical operators to Value Beyond just true and false everything we've done so far with logical operators Falls putting those things together and working with prepositions that represent each set of operations on values that involve numbers and strings and other structures.  The way we're going to Define this in the way, we're going to build this up this idea of what we're going to call a predicate and what a man which could be numbers. I could be some kind of other structure that were interested in talking about and produces a true or false value these propositional formulas or compound prepositions. We've been talking about the compound prepositions had a bunch of propositional variables. We can fill in true or false for each propositional variables. And now we're saying that a predicate takes in values from some domain that we specify and then produces true or false. I'm so this is going to generalize this idea. We've been working with  I'm very concretely what this means for us is that we can start to think about extending the tables. We've been drawing with not just true and false values in The Columns of numbers in the columns. In this case. I'm in interpreting them as numbers right now. I just have three three lengths bit strings in it and then we can talk about their interpretation with a different number representations we have so this there's several credit gets here. There's several credit gets here that I've written and I'm writing them in the same sort of sentence like we wrote some of the propositions are we talked about before? So the first one says X represents a positive number in with three two's complement X represents a positive number in with three twos compliment and you can see the True Values.  Well for that are exactly when it's greater than zero.  And it's not where is greater than zero. So it's not any of the negative numbers were that leading bit is 1 indicating that it's negative.  I'm so we're in this case. If we're just talking about these bit strings of length 3 for the input X. These are all of the Three Links things that I could be so much like some of the truth tables we've been drawing. This is pretty complete view of all the values we care about. So if we're going if we want to talk about X representing a negative number in with three twos complement we can fill in the truth values for that as well that's going to be false for  These first four rows and then true.  When there's a 1 in the leading those represent the negative numbers in with three two's complement.  What is the last column represent? What would you write for the sentence if you wanted to talk about this last column is a predicate. What would you write? I'm not I want to see him.  Okay hands hands. What's a swallow is that a boy would be there English description of this predicate in the last column.  X is an even number X is an even number that has other descriptions or want to refine that in anyway, yeah.  X is not odd. Alright. Otherwise you want to describe it actually a bunch of just those two might open up a door. Talking about more.  X Animals full of to keep telling others others  Yeah.  Last bit is zero so that actually if we look at the teas they correspond exactly do in Lafayette zero.  Is 0 an even number or an even number because we Define even number is as multiples of 2 and so we can multiply 2 by 0 and get zero so that I mean that's that makes a bunch of things work. Well, in other definitions we care about with the integers number for that reason. Yes, it is a lot of ways we could write this which is pretty interesting and has a lot of ways we could write this down and also one thing that's interesting is no one said this extra thing that's at the end of both of these which is that in with three two's complement which is kind of interesting like the first answer was just has an even number does it matter if we which interpretations we pick 4 if x has an even-numbered we have to pick two's complement.  We have two pictures compliment for to make sense that X is an even number is what does predicate mean?  Any other representations where is also would be even?  So for all the tests to be clear what I'm asking for all the first for the first two columns in with three twos complement.  and one of the first descriptions we got was x's and even number do I have to add more information here to make this true or their representations were this is true and true versus not being true for the number representations we talked about  Squeeze Inn  What what representations make this? Okay talk about this War II what representations would make this true representations of numbers that make this true.  Okay, sweetheart. We have talked about several representations of numbers in binary. Which one for which ones would this be true for which ones would this be true representation?  So you're saying maybe not in one's complement the people generally agree that a nun if this was unsigned fixed with these numbers would be even interpreting them that way it was unsigned fix with two's complement fixed with their are all even if we interpret according to the predicate matches to even 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 1. Yeah, I know that ruin that bro Zone one compliment doesn't work, but this would work for both.  Two's complement with three and it would also work in unsigned.  with three woodworking sign magnitude woodworking sign magnitude  sign magnitude  do you think this would be the even wrote the trews represent even numbers in sign magnitude?  If you think it doesn't hum.  Who is silence as first next time we're just looking at the magnitude of vector there and so like 00 for the one that I circled. It also works in sign magnitude.  And we can think about this predicate in a number of ways we can think about it as just one of these right or we can think about it even in any of these we can think about is even in all of these we could even say well it's even in all of these representations zero it not being I'm so there's lots of his ways we can describe this predicate and so I wanted to make this point because this definition on your worksheet that says to work to Braddock it's over the same domain are equivalent means they evaluate to the same truth values. So all of the all of those things having zero in the least significant fit interpretation even in the unsigned with interpretation,  A lot of ways to say the same thing for thinking about different representations.  So I don't have to question next I'm just going over to the next row on your hand out. I was this is just the road next to the row for the even after the even number and and so I just want to ask you this question something to do with silent around first and then have you discussed what's a good English description or a good predicate description and I'm in an assumed that were interpreting acts as with three two's complement for this question. So just going to assume  five four  3  2  one just got this from  okay quick and again and again.  five four  321 okay, so looks like a lot of people converged on who can very funny and yeah, we can certify and I find cases that don't match all of a b c and d so if we want to look at a house represents an odd number 0 x represents a non- number but here we have a negative number. We have a number that is even in positive. But here we have a number that's positive X represents a number that is not positive. It is not negative.  We're both positive and negative numbers here. So none of these actually fit generated this table of randomly choosing. This is a perfectly reasonable predicate definition of values for which we produced through. These are the values for which reproduce listed in table form, but there isn't a great English description. I can find that that matches these very well sort of listing of the particular values that produce true. It's where we just to find them by saying. Well here's where is true and here's where it's false. That's a perfectly valid definition of a predicate. We might call Define this to be  I'm going to just make up a name here. I'm going to call it our cuz it was a little bit random how we came up with it. This is just the predicate and it's defined by this table top in the middle.  100 in twos compliment 100 is most negative number that can be represented. So it's the largest negative number so that they would end up being a sort of glossing over doing out the math for why that works out for 100 is the most negative number you can represent ends up working out that way to compliment. I don't want to do the math. But if you just plug those bits into the formula and do it out you end up getting a base to the W - 1 but negative and then all ones into compliment is -1 represent.  So yeah.  100 is not 0 in to Scotland.  Yeah, so one of the reasons we one of the reasons we prefer to compliment over one's complement when building machines and doing low-level work is that only has one representation of zero unlike one's complement sign magnitude representation 1002 not represent a value.  They're true and false value should be exactly the same. So they have the same domain and for every value in that domain have the same truth value.  So none of so on this line.  These three columns are not equivalent. None of this none. No pair of these columns is equivalent if we talked about the predicate axes and even number in with three twos compliment and I went through another column and kept the predicate x's and even number in unsigned with three binary then and all the values in the rows of the same and all the truth values match exactly.  Ask another question. So for this for this example different values of the rightmost column that you have on your sheet, which of these three products matches this Collins description.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay.  I'm not going to do another round on this one. If we I'm just I just want to talk through a few of the interesting cases. Here's the same for English descriptions that we had on the last question and X definitely doesn't represent a nonzero number cuz again zero is included and zeros. In fact, the only thing that's true here.  There's a bunch of non-negative numbers that aren't true here. So be can't be can't work. There's a bunch of even and positive numbers that aren't true. So she cannot work that is exactly the case where if it's not positive and not negative. Then the only number that fixes zero. So the answer here is the D matches this description.  Any questions about the answer D here or applying any of the other any of the other cases for this for this question?  Okay, so I want to move on to another definition about predicate says just a youthful definition about credit cats that helps us talk about them. And so the definition is this idea of the set of values for which a predicate is true value is in the domain that make the predicate true and really this is a piece of vocabulary like well, it's in the truth set of this predicate so we know etcetera so truth said just is just a piece of vocabulary. We need to know and so if we take that first X represents a positive number in with three 2s complement, I just put... It wouldn't fit on one line. Then the truth set of that of that predicate is the value the value is in the domain that produces true which in this case are  That's awesome. Which in this case r001?  010 and 011 in the domain the domain only has three values where there's a truth for the end. So just to just a point of notation. I'm using curly braces and putting the values in curly braces with commas in between them.  I'm not sure if I've written a set on the board yet. It was on the first day notation notation page, but I just want to be clear about how I'm drunk sense.  So I want to I want to write something for this second blank to also do a little bit of notation. Not an is come up with short hands for writing out these long English sentences that we write every time.  Things like the English sentence X represents a positive number in with three twos complement. Every time we want to do this you see I already have two... It out cuz it wouldn't fit on a slide. Let's define. Let's define p of x  is  X is a positive number.  And we're going to use this notation within a variable in parentheses definition. They were kind of function. This also looks like an is a function definition Define anti-vax, which is X is a negative number.  And in both of these it's useful to be precise because I've been trying to be precise with his representation. Let's say 3 to compliment her about  so now we written out the long description of a long description first, and now we can use these definitions be short and other predicate which is that the number is  not  positive  And not negative.  This is kind of thing. We can write when we want to express something that uses the results of multiple compound compound proposition that uses predicate and it produces now we can talk about putting X in here and getting truth values out except for this predicate if we're assuming the same domain number.  Okay, shout it out or have this what's the truth set for this predicate?  020  This is notational another way. We can express 420 and the English sentence. We had was x's and number that's not positive and not negative make a quick Point here. It was actually on the slide last lecture, but it went by really fast on that slide about logical logical identities and below. This is not  pfx or and effects  and note the parentheses. I put the not outside the parentheses in the or inside the parentheses and I want you to think about this for a minute. I'm not saying whether I did exactly the thing that was on the identity slide is the predicate.  Is it equivalent predicate to the one above are those two predicates equivalent equivalent products?  Okay. Okay, so  If you think that these are not equivalent, so there's some case where they would have different truth values for the same the same input X.  If they are, so this is this is maybe you saw it on maybe you threw out the truth table was you could do to prove this to yourself. Maybe you saw it on the logical identity slide in your remembering it but it's generally a property that for any two propositional variables are compound proposition and not why is equivalent to not X or Y name this is called demorgan's law identities that has a really named after a person use this to talk about this mountain positive not negative relationship.  I would say the argument would be that demorgan's law you use de Morgan's law to demonstrate it. And if you wanted in the proof for the Morgans are the demonstration for demorgan's law is just the the four rows of the truth table for both of these two for both of these two propositions that would show  so that's a bit of notation. We're going to use these capital letter to find functions as a convention for predicates in a number of places. We have these curly braces with, separated values for sets and we have to soak a bulary of Truth sets that we're going to use to talk about the inputs to predicates that produce true.  I want to talk about another example of a predicate.  Which is a predicate over this different domain working with these hex colors. You've been working with them in homework Lottery out of class stuff. And so I want to talk about a couple predicates here one is that sees color C is a gray color my gray. I mean we could show it in grayscale. We could only needs it only needs like black and white basically and so what I have here is on the table, but I put some... I'm skipping a bunch of Rose. Now. I want to say a few things about the stable. This table is definitely finite there's only 16 to the 6th 16 to the 6th, right? That's all that's a very big number but if we had enough paper or a big enough projector, we could draw all of the road.  I put... So I can fit on a slide and also so that we can sort of do a little bit of work with a table that's too big to work with all at once in our head but we still know has some finite number for UPS in so we could imagine having these 16 to the 6 rows each with a true or false in it based on what I have written for the true and false values here though. I'm a question I want to ask is how would we write down the truth set for this thing? We said truth stats are useful way to talk about it. It's nice to be able to talk about the set of values that produce true hear what kind of ideas can we have? Those of you can see my slide notes in the front row can see it says write down set builder notation here. Is there some way so maybe that's a that's a bit of an what would you try if you wanted to write down the truth set here. How would you describe it either in English or in set notation or some other notation, you know?  Except for the predicate see is gray or C is grayscale, especially based on seeing sort of how I feel.  All right.  So many hundreds of time. I'm going to give an answer for this and not solicit lots of answers and do a lot of discussion, but I wanted to give you the chance to think about this on your own before I just write the answer on the board. I would go about doing this is I would use I would use  So I would say these are the exes.  Or at least call them sees since I use see in the left hand side C.  So actually I'm going to use a little more notation and sometimes I use for this example for our definition of talk about that definition of a hex color.  And what what do we want to be true like an English? What do we want to be true about the color for it to be in this set for to be a member of the predicate?  What did you come up with four things you want to describe? Yeah.  R1 R2 equals G1 G2 equals B1 B2 interesting in the holes in your discussion, That's interesting. We haven't talked about equals in terms of our logical operator and xor addition. We bought all these operations and the kind of suggestion. A lot of people I think we're going to have here is to say things like R1 R2 equals G1 G2 that the components are equal and  G1 G2 equals  B1 B2 and we might even want to be very precise here and say that the blues are also equal to the Reds.  And we can argue about the properties of equals right I'm saying right now I'm taking equals to be some operation to takes two numbers and produces true or false depending on if they're the same number we could argue about different properties that equals might have but I want to be clear here that this is a new operation and we have to interpret it mathematically, but it's not MediCal operation is producing a true or false hear that were using in this logical way.  But but this is to be clear about what this means in terms of colors. This is just saying all the red the red component the green component are all the same. I was just in color land means that no color is going to stand out. This is going to be some intensity between black and white and be a gray.  It's really interesting. That is the question is how does equals differ from the biconditional or the infant is another way we set it the double-ended Arrow operation. How is equals different operation or biconditionals or if it only works on true and false values right here if we were the equal shares like this math operations math equality, but evaluating to true or false the reason of highlighting in math in general has some different meanings, but I just wanted to call out if we're checking if the numbers are equal in producing true or false.  You're so you're so you're saying you're arguing something where you're saying? Well, if I know that one of these is equal to another and then there is a quality that I know that they're all right. I'm trying to be very just be very precise. You're not assume too much about how we reason about equals and just saying I want all three comparisons. I want to know that these are really all equal know if we could argue about what properties people house and maybe write a large maybe writing equivalent predicate but looks shorter, but I'm just so this is one way we can talk about the truth set for see is gray when we could talk about it. Also what I've written for after the after the pipe in the  Set builder notation is also a way to think about Define the expression. We might use to define this predicate. We were trying to write a definition like one of these we might write an expression over here to describe it or compound proposition in this is the kind of thing.  So that's how we might talk about that. I want you to think next about this other predicate bitsy has equal red and green red and green components in so just take a minute for the table that we have here for see having equal in red and green component.  Okay, just Shout It Out answers true or false.  Second row that was cool.  That's what just happened.  3rd row true or false  all all rows where I've listed a specific value for C true or false.  Is this true for all the rows in the really big table that has 16 to the 6th? What's an example where it's not true? It's not true.  Pants pants pants, I won't be able to hear 6 digits.  Yeah, go ahead.  I guess that maybe I would have written out up here if I was writing things in complete order, but this one it is neither gray nor are the red and green component. I want to make this important point to make here which is when you're thinking about a big but finite domain, right? So this is a large butts.  And by large really all I mean here I probably shouldn't say large there's lots of relative sizes of finite domain. It doesn't fit on a piece of paper and you write some examples of it. You need to be aware that you might you definitely need to be exploring outside. Those examples thinking about representative examples in different ways would be easy to write a bunch of examples examples, he wrote down think that it might be true for everything but we need to think about this interesting examples.  This is also going to set us up for thinking about claims that we might want to make like this predicate is actually true in every Row in the table or this predicate is actually false in all the rows in the table and claims like that. So that's actually the last thing I want to talk about today is to ideas that relate to talking about all the rows in a table for a particular predicate.  So there's two definitions here one is what we call a universal quantification and there's just some notation in language around this. This is what we're just going to let us make statements like for all of the values in the domain.  The predicate is true. So the truth set is all the values in the domain and there's some value in the domain. That means there's one row that has true in it somewhere the truth that is not completely empty for the predicate.  So just in terms of a picture if we talked about whether we can see what's defined as a positive number, then we would just look at this column underneath the predicate and ask are all the rows true in this case the statement true because we see if you some faucets here. So it's not true that for all x x is a positive number.  Thank you, and we can find any road that has a false in it. And this is a counterexample to this claim. So we asked you to provide evidence that for all statement or Universal quantification. Is it true we can find a row in the table that has falls for the predicate. The counter example that demonstrates that they can't possibly be a universal statement.  Existential statement says we need to find some row that's true in order to have evidence for the existential statement. And there's another vocabulary word. We use here which is some road that has true in it is a witness for that existential statement. So if we wanted to talk about the existential statement of there being a positive number there definitely is true. There's some positive number in this domain.  The main thing I want to be really clear about how we're going to start over. The next few lecture is talking about existentials and for all statements. You can at least four things that have finding domains. You can think about them just as this question about columns in a table. There's going to be this is going to be on the table and we're going to look at a particular column for a predicate and see if all those values are true or one of those values is true.  What's in a few examples with these to try using them to make sure we can work with this notation. So first I just want to be really precise about what what it means when we ask for a counterexample and Witnesses. So this is this predicate which is going to be even again in this fixed with two complement representation. We've been using a counterexample for this.  4  for all X  EFX  Is shut up?  counterexample for this  counterexample  001 examples of any odd number is a counterexample for this.  and then a witness for  there exists an X such that X is even is any even number so something like 0 1 0  So Witnesses are the 4 x 4 existentials and give us his positive information is summer exist counter-examples. All this negative information looking for false prefer. All I bet you can't possibly be true for all columns more interesting combination. I want to talk about a couple different predicate Hue is going to be exit X represents 3MP is going to be the X represents a positive number directions of QX80. Think about which of these is true for all X is in the stable.  some of that in the first round in 5 4 3 2 1  Okay, click it again with the results of discussing this  k543  21. Okay. So there's some few things going on here one is thinking thinking about implication any other is thinking about this new for all notation.  The other is a flickering projector.  So if we take the we take the first option A and see if we can find a row where this would be false or if this would be true for every row.  Just add a column here for a q of X implies P of x.  and the First Tee of x  and so one of the interesting things about implication that we saw is if the the the proposition on the left side of the arrow or the first part is false, then the implication is always true. So all of the Rose  where X represents three is false or true in this implication.  But the road where X represents three we have to check this value and implication is true. If the arrow is true and the part after his crew. So this is also true. This actually gives a little bit of a justification for why is Define the way it is if we read this sentence for all x if x is 3 then X is a positive number sounds very reasonable write that sentence sounds very reasonable. Right and one of the ways this sort of works out with his Universal qualifications. We get the trews for free in all the cases where are assumption doesn't hold right. So if it's not 3:00, then we're not really interested in inspecting the conclusion for those rows or just going to get the true for this.  Location and so this sort of justifies why we have this may be funny looking rule for implications because otherwise we just kind of sentence with this sentence is really a reasonable sentence to want to talk about Xanax represents three definitely not true. Right there's lots of numbers that are positive and aren't 3 until any of these roads were that's the case. So for example, this x is positive but is not three example for we'd end up having a false in that case for me.  So the the main points when is lecture are worth? "
