    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Okay, let's get started. So there's a couple things I want to talk about talk about today and just to set the stage for this week and next week. We're going to get practice with strong induction. So those the Technic we saw at the end of class on Friday was this idea of doing induction where we get to use the inductive hypothesis for all the numbers up to the current number were proving instead of just for the last number so it will practice with that again. And when was it introduced a new proof technique as well the main thing we're going to be working with over today and Wednesday and maybe into Friday is talking about some properties of the sets of numbers. We left these really implicit so far. We've talked kind of about what  Is there a kind of using integers and assume that you've seen integers before and definition of prime numbers that are prime numbers in particular we did things like assume that there are infinitely many primes in one clicker question. And that's something that I want to talk about in detail today. This is the reason we're doing this is because it's going to set us up for talking about infant size for precisely. So there's all these things that we use in Computing that are sometimes and sometimes we talked about things like the set of DNA strands that are up to a particular thing weighs ideas relate to numbers relate to how many there are related how many integers there are I'm in relate to the different kinds of numbers.  The numbers in order to use fully talk about the size of abscess and it turns out that it's really important to talk about the size of sense. So one of the things we've been talking about all quarter and using all quarter, this idea base expansion is that it forces us to confront another representation of numbers. So we have the representation of numbers that we talked about doing things in fixed with binary in base 16 one more representation of numbers, but this is nice because it helps  And one interesting question we could ask is how do we prove that we can actually represent every positive integer is 2 expansion 3 expansion, right? Every positive integer actually has one of these expansions that we can find for it. I think we all kind of believe that cuz we figured out how to do it for just about every number we've try but it's interesting to think about what a proof of that property would look like because that would tell us that really these Basics Mansions which means that they're really kind of this more direct representation of numbers. It's not just that some of them exist. It's that they know we can really talk about these things being the same the same set of numbers.  So we had these two ways of calculating a base expansion given a number one involved repeatedly dividing the number and the other involved in doing a log at the start to figure out how many digits there would be working through those digits individually thinking a little bit about which one of these we talked a little bit of a on Friday about how sometimes are proofs related to specific is going to be more related to a proof and we're going to use strong induction in this case approved by strong induction that we can always find an expansion. It's really interesting to see which one of the station's going to look more like that which one of these implementations the one where we repeatedly divide or the one where we sort of calculate the number of bits first using log and then fill them in  Do you think is going to be more amenable to it like a strong induction proof or more related to a strong induction proof? Which of these is going to think about it the structure of a strong induction proof?  Okay any thoughts on this which one of these is going to be more amenable to a strong induction proof is our strong induction proof going to be more like the first one or more like the second one. Do you think?  you think  Someone from the back half of the center for the center section.  More like the first one or more like the second one.  On the side closer to me in the back half of the center section.  If you just have the same base 1 or base 2.  music  Find a second one.  the second one  Yeah.  How many units?  How many digits you have interesting? So you're saying in the first one? It's sort of doesn't it doesn't have this global view where you figure out all these the number of digits and have to work within that you're always sort of just going to jump start dividing. That's an interesting description any other description  I agree. By the way, I think these to the 2nd of limitation is going to be more like a strong induction proof. Any other reasons. Yeah.  Interesting. So you're saying it might be the case here starts at 0 and it might be easier to start from those smaller interesting to that's interesting to think about as well. The only thing I point out is that one thing that's going on here is that in the value of an which is stored in queue get smaller in an interesting way. We keep dividing it over and over again. So and is immediately starting Q at the beginning of this procedure and then we keep dividing it by some numbers by be in the case of base 2 expansions. It'll be divided by 2. And that means it's definitely a specific way and so strong induction will let us talk about that smaller number that were using using talk about that.  And so will be able to say something about this / 4/2 number and use that in the proof doing this by strong induction. So our goal is to so I'm looking at the the first errand that you have the every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of 2. What do you think the base case looks like for this the base case look like for this?  the basis step  basis.  Heck is the bassist up here.  What are we trying to show? What are we trying to show in the basis that for this proof will be way more fun if it's  Okay. What are we trying to show us what we need to demonstrate here in this space. What do I need to demonstrate?  When is the distinct power of 2 is a way of saying it when is a distinct power of two? What else is on their way is a good sort of refine that I have one and I want to make a way to describe it.  He said one is a distinct.  power of two, I'm going to just refine this a little bit and say one is  sum of distinct powers of 2  because really what we're trying to Super going to try and show this in general for all numbers and the distinct power of to hear. What's the life we would slip power of two. What are we going to pick as the the coefficient? We're kind of looking for we're looking for an a 0 in base 2 that's equal to one. That's what we're looking for.  Right there exists some a 0 right so that we can say that that's what we're trying to demonstrate here. Right? What's the coefficient? We're in base 2 efficient there in one of them to represent one. It's just going to work out in this case that we only need one and only pick a 0 equal 0 this whole summons up.  All right, I do not right.  I do that right.  No, I'm trying to sneak something by you here to make sure that you're paying attention and all the pieces, right?  What I do wrong.  E0 should be equal the one. Yeah, so  really the expansion here is the coefficients * 100 * going to be the coefficients in the binary representation different powers of two prints of this is 1 * 2 to the zero and that's equal to one right in the binary representation or the base to representation. We can represent one thing we want to show exactly that there's some sequence of these coefficients. They're going to B100 it's cuz we're in base 2 that makes that makes a binary representation for a particular number and this would demonstrate the base case would be able to say here is a zero for the base case.  So let's talk about the the recursive step now. I have a few options which of these which of these options makes sense for this. Sorry. I'm just going to pass up.  Which of these options make sense of the recursive step?  5 4 3 2 1  Quicken again again again  books  K5  4321 okay, so so so that's interesting. So some people I just want to compare the answers before I'll show you the answers before and after freezing and where did where did they move they moved A's and B's or the both more move to a disease that looks like a good idea to hear implementation proof is showing up in be so there's a lot of Correspondence there and we can we can say why why be is in fact a good idea and works here in a minute. I'm a works or not. So whether it's both of these or if it's just be and so what we're saying is Well, we can definitely right and is this some  I can come up with some binary representation for an by the inductive hypothesis. And all we need to do is we know we can always add to 2002 it add add one to that number and we just be adding on one more power of two there and that produces nplusone. So we're done really important one really important word in the definition of the property and in the justification in a true  Yeah this word distinct.  Says, well, you don't get to just add up to to the zero over and over and over again in the by base 2 binary expansion. What you have is one coefficient for the power 0 and 1 coefficients the power one and one go fishing for the power to sew these have to be distinct powers of 2 1in each one in each position until a doesn't work because if we if we ran through and sort of talked about either building an implementation out of a 0 + 2 + 0 + 220 + 220 equals 4, which is not what this property is trying to say this property trying to talk about distinct hours up to so it does not work. That would not be a good argument here because of the word distinct what shows up within the property. I'm 10 and justification here, right? This justification is just inconsistent because there's nothing that says the powers of to use for  220 already include that power and so the Sobe actually works here and I want to just talk about soda works.  So the idea for YB work is  that  a different IP Works. Let's just imagine a particular number. Let's imagine.  Talking about making sure that there's a base 2 expansion for 6. So let's choose 6 as the thing. We're trying to prove and we can run that inductive hypothesis step for for sex and that says the first thing the inductive hypothesis step says is take  6  2 and assume  there is a  base 2  expansion 3 we know that exists, right? We know that exist in this in the structure of the proof. We're going to have to demonstrate that later cuz it's an assumption. So we'll talk about that in a minute, but we know that one one phase 2  represents  3 which is 60 of 2. We know that and we can talk about how we justify that in a second.  And the way we use that information to build the representation for 6 is we say we're going to shift this down.  By 1 and then we're going to buy one spot. So these are all still distinct powers of 2 or just using exponents for each one of them moving them over by one position mean increasing all of their exponents by one and then we're going to fill in this box with either a 0 or 1 in this case Zero.  because six  mod  2 is equal to 0 interesting results care. Now if we wanted to show that 3 works, right? This is actually if we wanted to push this proof all the way all the way through for a particular number. We then talk about 3/2 having some representation 302.  has a representation which is just one base to we can ship that over to be one in an empty box face-to-face gets filled in with a one because three  this is 3 mod.  And eventually we're going to bottom out at 1 because here we would end up bottoming out this entire chain of justification. And this is an interesting recursive structure because every time we talk about justifying the next level we going to bottom out at 1 and give us a smaller number every time we can always get this entire justification of using base to the function base to I'm in the sort of why that function always works and produces different powers.  Any questions about this idea of this proof before going on?  list two more  proofs I want to do in detail in the book. So I'm just going to talk about it talk about the big ideas. And then there's another proof with another proof techniques and I want to talk about so we've talked about base expansion does a way to represent positive integers. There's another way we can represent positive integers and that's by representing them as a product of a bunch of prime numbers. So there's this theorem that's an interesting theorem that every positive integer greater than one can be written down as a product of prime number so multiplication in a prime number greater than 1 and so it's kind of interesting to see how this works and why  How it all ends up giving us this idea that a collection of primes is another way to represent a number because it's going to factor into those Prime talk about that number so you can have the decimal representations and base expansions representation and its prime factorization is another way to uniquely talk about that number kind of an interesting property of how the first thing I want to ask is which of these options here are factorizations by which I are prime factorization by which I mean they show how the number is represented as a product of prime numbers. So which one of these are factorizations  5 4 3 2 1  I want to point out a few things here actually, all the answers answers are interesting facts about this for 10 or 20 seconds might clear up one or two confusion between you just talked about it for 20 seconds.  Okay quick and again and again.  Play 5 4 3 2 1.  There's a couple things I want to point out a bee does not fit this definition because one is not Prime.  And part of that is because the definition of primes just says that the numbers have to be greater than one common definition of crimes that just rules out one entirely because it's not very interesting to talk about the factors of 1 and starting from 2 and up makes it so they were talking about numbers that clearly when we have a prime number two different factors that are just one in that number with one of these cases are hard to understand and it's not very interesting number for anything we want to do is Prime's so we can keep multiplying by 1 over and over and over again and keep expanding the factorization with more factors of 1 so we will not affect the prime factorization of 100.  We took out the one that would be in a see this doesn't work because again for is not Prime.  So we're trying to write these out as products of completely prime numbers only prime numbers. And so we would have to break this up into two and two to talk about the factorization of 20.  This is a trick question and I didn't warn you usually like to warn you when I ask her questions, but they are both reasonable answers here tractor with 3 and 3 which or both Prime. So that's a prime factorization. And in order to talk about the fact that prime numbers prime factorization. We have to allow the sequences were talking about I'm can just be one prime long. So threes factorization is just three that's the only fact the only prime factor of 3 and so we just have to take out to Sakura station so that we can say all of the positive integers 2in above have the factorization.  and I didn't give you a spot to give a protest vote here, but both of these work a lot of folks and  the the proof of this is  I want to see I want to say here. I'm just going to lay a little bit about the basis step in detail.  musically argue  that to  back door back doors  It's so much like the three case on the last line.  In a recursive step is pretty interesting.  Because we get to assume by the recursive step that all of the numbers that are smaller than the number we're looking at our Prime. Sorry. I have a prime factorization. So that assumption ends up being really useful because we can start to talk about composing the number we're looking at and the two cases that are listed on your sheet. If you want to think about what happens in these two cases just a preview for If you want to review this directly in the book case one is that  so just to be clear all  positive  incense  and less than or equal to n  have  a factorization  and we want to show that n + 1 does.  And so either end plus one.  Is prime.  or  And plus one equals some multiplication of two factors. That aren't n + 1 + 1 if it's a composite number that end plus one has to be equal to something. That's like most just say k  x m  where can I buy a is greater than 1 and M is greater than 1 write. It must have some other two numbers because it's not fine because the definition of prime says the only factors would be in plus one and one but this must mean that there's some other factors if it's not Prime.  Then we can do it. We can use inductive hypothesis on K&M because not only do we know that K&M are greater than one. We also know that K&M must be less than 10 plus one because we multiply them together to get in plus one. So K is less than and + 1 + m is less than and plus one.  Tells us we can use the inductive hypothesis on K&M. So K&M must have some prime factorization and then we can talk about the primes that make up K in the primes that make up hands together to get the to get a prime factorization 4 n + 1 + 1 is already done because the only Factor there isn't plus one and you can see how details and any necessary to have algebra is filled in by looking looking this up in the book the page number. I believe the page number is on the is on your hand out. There's another property that's interesting to talk about.  So there's this other again. So this is all on the back of a sheet some space for talking about this is on the back of the hand out. And so there's this idea that there's infinitely many prime. Like there's just an infinite number of primes no matter how many you list you'll always be able to lift more crimes stopped at some prime number and there's no more prime numbers. This is a difficult statement to prove on its own in this class so far. We haven't settled so useful to try and prove something else. That means the same thing to us. So the first the first thing I want to talk about is which property we should actually try to prove.  In order to get this idea that there are infinitely many primes which one of these accurately expresses that.  5 4 3 2 1  the most of the class agrees and I just want to say one or two things about this study is the Adidas one way to talk about this property in a way that will be a little more straightforward for us to do a proof.  And the other one so there is a smallest prime number is true, but not useful and not equivalent to this. It's too there's no prime number smaller than 2 but it's not the same property isn't so it's not very useful. There is no smallest prime number is not true and not equivalent to this. There is a greatest prime numbers an interesting property that would tell us if we knew there was a greatest prime number that would tell us actually that there's finitely many primes if we knew there was some number that was Prime and there were no other primes larger than it we can just look at all the numbers that are smaller than that number and that must be in some number of those will be Prime and that's it. That's all the Primes there are so interesting property. It happens to not be true but its negation is exactly expressing his idea that has infinitely many primes. We can always find a larger prime number.  Under the new Pro strategy were going to use to talk about this and it's an interesting and there's a specific reason it helps us structure how we talk about these proofs. What I want you to do is just read the statement of proof by contradiction. It's at the bottom of the backside of a proof by contradiction and a little bit of a start here and you have our observations you have about this definition and how it starts talking about how to push this professor.  Okay, what question questions or observations about this definition in a proof by contradiction? What's weird? What's interesting questions about observations about it? Yeah.  The right hand side is always going to evaluate the false interesting will come back to the other things that you have questions about or observe their interesting about this definition of proof by contradiction. Yeah.  Interesting thing if it was true that the the conclusion of this implication is a contradiction then maybe that causes some problems for showing at overall statement so we can go back to that too. I'm just asking questions and thoughts from the other questions or observations about this definition of proof by contradiction or questions all the proof we started  Howard Beach  Yeah, yes, and then your question is like in this context. It's pretty clear that P&R should be propositions or predicate or Buy credit card expression propositions that are related to being Prime because that's what we're working on. Right but in general like how do we pick a good are because there's nothing in these nothing that says we're trying to prove something about our in the beginning. So we had to invent this our right of this is that  This part and I'm being careful to only Circle the conclusion.  This is definitely a contradiction is going to evaluate.  First first question. Yes, right that is a contradiction that always evaluates the fall. Second question was doesn't that mean we're going to have trouble demonstrating this entire implication is well that actually tells us something about not which is that we are going to have to say something about that left hand side of the hypothesis being in order for this whole thing to be true which is going to be interesting. So please demonstrate weird thing. Well if we don't know much about  The relationship between P&R when we start out know you're asking how do we pick an are one of the ideas here is we're going to pick an r that that we think is that we already know is true. Somehow I get almost obvious that it's true like some proof that we've already already done. Right? So this are that we're choosing in this proof is something we just talked about being true. And really the interesting thing here is his true. Anyway, we are is going to be true regardless of what the value of P. You're not pee is the interesting thing here is we're going to show that we get to demonstrate this right hand side that we're aiming for the really the goal here is to show that implies fault that actually would would work in many of the cases where we want to prove by contradiction.  Using this our house of structure the proof by saying there's this thing we know is true. And if we make date we can show that it's false so clearly because if we negated it would be able to demonstrate this nonsense clean. And so the choice of our it's interesting the way the book rights this because I've seen this written in other ways would like not P implies fall, but I like the way the book rights it because he guides us towards picking some property that we know something about so in this case or picking his other property, it's something we just proved and we're going to show that if he isn't true that if not p is true. Then we know is true has to be  This structure of picking some other property than demonstrating it is false and it's some other property that we know is true is what we're going to do when we set up proof by contradiction.  So here we're making this assumption that there is some largest prime number because remember the property that we were trying to prove is that there is no greatest nation. Is that there exists a largest prime number? So that's that's not pee this part here.  corresponds to the assuming the not be here and we chose our  to be this thing that we just proved that some other property that's talking about.  All natural number of positive integers greater than one relates to this here. It's going to be true no matter what. So what we're trying to show is the Des property are is false.  call  we want to show that there's some positive integer that is greater than one that is not a product of primes.  Want to show that there is some positive integer greater than 1 that is not a product of primes. It's greater than one if not a product of primes if we can show that then we'll be happy.  I'll be happy to feel however you want to feel but I'll be happy.  so  I'm just going to rewrite this to show here that we just talked about.  which is  some number  greater than one  that is not  a product  Apprentice  that's the sort of counterexample version or the negated version of the statement of our is that there exists a number greater than one and it's not a product made the Assumption. So the Top Line says assume that there's a largest prime number PN since we've made that assumption on this calls back to something I missed out or talk about this entire sequence of all the prime numbers.  Because if PN is the largest prime number all of the primes must be smaller than that number so we can just list them all out there. They are all the way up to talk about p.m.  And this is this is an interesting idea that we can just list these out and I want to highlight that.  We can do this for this arbitrary but fixed.  PN that we've assumed  The assumption is that we have this largest prime number. We know must exist because of this exists statement. And since we have this arbitrary, but fixed number that were talking about that we know exists we can say well there is this sequence goes up to this number if we wanted to go into tons of detail, we could try and not have any... By describing that thing with some kind of set builder notation or some kind of recursive definition. But since this is some fixed number is definitely some fixed integer. It's totally reasonable to write this out with these... And then we're trying to look at this number that is greater than one that's not a product of primes and I hear is the idea here that we're going to choose this number Q, which is  Multiplication of all of the prime numbers plus 1 and just to put the parentheses here so that it's really clear what this number is multiplied together to that number.  And no this is now this is like a counterexample proof. We're trying to actually witness proof. We're trying to show that this is not a product of prime. This number Q could not possibly be a product of prime. This is like an exist and we're trying to show that this number can't be a product of primes.  Actually, let's just go down here cuz I think this statement of this intermediate property. She idea that we can use here is that we written product of all of these primes and then add one and the intermediate property we need is that none of these P eyes, none of these individual Prime could possibly be a factor of Q?  People that statement for a minute. None of these could possibly be a factor of Q.  Want to just do a little bit of explanation of why not the case. Let's just think about p14 least algebraic manipulation here. So let's think about P1 we can write Q.  as P1  X T2... TN  plus one  and that's really interesting because our definition of factoring says that if the P1 would be a factor of Q if we could write you as a q is  P1 X some k + 0 there's no remainder when we talked about writing this as a factor is what it would mean.
