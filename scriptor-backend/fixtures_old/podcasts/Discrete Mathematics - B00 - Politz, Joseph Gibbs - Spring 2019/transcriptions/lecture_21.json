    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. Happy Friday everyone. So today we're going to keep talking about sets and talk a little bit about sizes of sense. We're going to use these sets of numbers is representative examples, but we're going to do some smaller examples than needs infinite sets of numbers as well to build up to a good understanding of what it means to talk about the size of asset because I don't know how to tell you without building up some more definitions. Why any one of these debts could be bigger or smaller than another one. So we need we need to develop some understanding of So one thing I want to point out is that we do have one. So that's really helpful for talking about sizes of sets which is subsets.  One thing that we should have some intuition about at this point is that if one set is a subset of another set then there's definitely definitely has no more elements than that other set is a subset of B. Emily doesn't have more elements than be. Imma be on that. We don't know if we don't have to talk about this doesn't get us the information that we want. If we wanted to try and talk about sizes of set this reminder sells what subsets actually tell us the rest of the definitions that we need subsets for a minute. So this is really question what the definition of subset. So there's two blanks here. So 1 is a is a subset of B. The other blank is a is not a subset of B. So which pair of definitions hear a pair of statements here correspond to those two statements.  5 4 3 2 1 couple different answers here. So just got this one for a minute.  K break it again again again. There's there's a couple answers the people picked more than others and there's a good reason why one of them several people pick doesn't quite work.  Okay 5 4 3 2 1.  Some more people move towards this answer of sea hear the most common the most common wrong answer was this doesn't work and the reason is because of this thing we often see we have an implication inside an existential crisis here be false is a witness for this existential. So this statement is true for things like  If we wanted to say one two is not a subset.  Of One race and that's this property is a not a subset of B. Well if we try to use this property and we can pick up a lot of elements for that. We can pick 9 or 7 or 4 elements that make this this part X being a false and would make a whole implication truth. So this is this idea of doing an existential with an implication is it sometimes looks reasonable but is not what we represent because of this hypothesis this right, if you push the negation through the fur all you end up with the there exists an X and X is not envy.  Okay. So now that we've sort of reminded ourselves about subsets so that we can talk about finding Witnesses or counterexample is based on those definition of questions about numbers.  Here's some different sets of number. So I began is the set of non-negative integers baked ziti integers are rational so that we talked about rationals this week. And then our Big R is the set of real numbers. So which one of these relationships which which one of these are true one of these directions.  5 4 3 2 1 I want you to come up with any more questions you have for me for me to give you any more definitions. You need that. You don't have that you need to answer this question. So think about it any more definitions you need from me in order to give this an answer that are true.  Okay. Is there anything more you want from me any more definitions you want from me to make this more precise or refined this question a little bit.  Yeah.  Just make sure there wasn't a set of natural numbers yet in this class was taken and defined it natural numbers started 0 and that sort of captured in this word non negative versus positive in the definition of any other definition of clarifications you want before before answering this more again.  interesting question again  . 5 4 3 2 1  so for one of the one of these to be false right for to not be true, we have to show a counterexample in both directions or show up an element is in both directions so that we could both parts of the or because it's definitely true that all the natural numbers are integers that part of this is definitely true. It's not true that this part is not true. It's not true that the managers are a subset of the natural numbers examples are right like -1 is a integer, but it's not a natural number a subset of the integers.  So that's definitely true.  And then let's talk about be so we said it says natural numbers are a subset of positive and the positive set of natural numbers place where you might have wanted to ask me what are + means no definition of our plus down here, but we've said for a z plus review Z plus a bunch and we always use the plus 2 mean this definition here starting at 1.  I'm so our place is all of the real numbers that are greater than 0 strictly greater than 0 so if we give an example example where an element is in the natural numbers, that's not in the positive real zero is in is in the natural numbers.  Combat Zero hoops, and let me use the right symbols when I'm writing this out is international numbers, but zero is not in our plus. So this direction isn't true.  And this direction has lots and lots of cases where there is an element that's in the positive reals. That's not in the natural numbers. 0.14 example is in the positive reals, but 0.1 is not  natural number  SoBe is definitely false. He's definitely false. We have this at least one example in both cases that sort of philosophize this subset relationship where it's in the left-hand side, but not in the right time set.  Going down we can sort of see that some of these relationships are similar to what similar to idea in a sew-in. It's not true that the pills are a subset of the rationals. That's kind of what we showed on Wednesday is not rational but it is a real number us we show that this direction doesn't hold but it is true that all the rational numbers are real numbers. So if we wanted a counterexample for this case, right we can say that square root of 2.  It's a real number but \u221a 2 is not a rational number will see how you draw the fancy q. There we go.  And a similar thing happens as we go down all the rational numbers are integers numbers like 1/2 aren't integers. But all the integers are rational numbers that holes in the other direction. Imma Be is actually false. Both of these directions are false.  That's kind of interesting. But from the perspective of asking about we have this idea that if one set is a subset of another it definitely can't be any bigger than that other set, right so we might be able to say something that's upset relationship. Indie tells us that there's no more integers then there are rational numbers.  Wouldn't be it's not so clear. Right? Are there more are there it is there any relationship to they have the same size or the positive is the positive reals a bigger set than the set of natural numbers like the subset relationship doesn't help us here. But that question is still an interesting question to ask which one of those sets is larger than the other one.  With the definitions we have it's really hard to say anything about that. It's really hard to say anything about that. So we have this morning tuition from subsetting. But we we need more definitions in order to meaningfully talk about sizes of these things. So we're going to introduce some definitions with the eventual goal of being able to answer these questions about relative sizes of even intimate side effects.  And we can ask me questions about these really simple sets. Right? The one thing we did when we introduced the idea of predicate in this class what simple examples would look like and then we generalized and it was nice to come up with definitions that actually worked on infinite in emphasizing for the first three questions here, which is definitely that in the first case the size of 1 2 3 is not less than or equal to size of one of the second thing one and to write the second one's true. The third one is true an interesting collection of elements in them question.  And we're going to use functions in an interesting way here to talk about using functions to relate two sets to one another relate the elements of two sets to one another in particular and that's going to give us a definition of kind of gives us less than and greater than or equal to idea for the sizes of set a reminder driving function is that they have a domain in a codomain domain and codomain are sets and the functions of the definition of a function elements of the domain or outputs elements of the domain for the function described relating the two sides of assets and we need some properties on functions in order to do that. So one of the first properties  If you keep this idea of sizes of sets in your mind as we go through these definitions, you'll start to see some of the shape of why we care about these definitions is and it's been in this funny way. So I'm going to underline some stuff for every a B in the domain of f of x equals F of B then  To say this in English. What I would say one to one means is that every input has a distinct output or every input has a different output. You give two different inputs to the function. You'll get two different outputs. It'll never be the case to different inputs to the function and you get the same outfit.  So that's what that's what 141 means look at these definitions little bit and pick which symbolic definition corresponds to the way we brought this above.  It's really interesting to ask if there's more than one right answer here.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay.  So let's talk about just a couple of these really quick. So that one that looks kind of like the contrapositive of the statement above is this one?  and actually this would be  another way of writing it except that we need to talk about the domain the domain of AMD be because that's the input or the domain of the function. So it doesn't make sense to talk about using F on a if they came from see who sees the photo man or the like a rain to the outputs of the function the set D in this answer but actually the contrapositive  So aside from those that works be is the answer that directly translates from English into symbols when a is like kind of clothes does it actually really close to the contrapositive but one thing that's interesting to remember about nested for Al's like this is if we look at A&B here.  There's nothing that tells us.  In this statement the day isn't the same element is be right for all for all there's nothing that tells of weekend to pick to the same element twice in a row. And so we need this extra constraint about equality of AMD inside the predicate for this to actually match the description in the same domain. We always end up picking the same moment twice.  I'm so these are this is the definition of a function being one to one distinct outputs for every input and we can actually use this to talk about sizes.  So if we can find the distinct output for every input  that means that the set we use for the codomain have to have had enough elements in it to provide a distinct output for every input.  So if there's a one-to-one function from C to D. That means he's at least big enough to have a specific output element for every input element from c d is at least that big  So these vertical bars they do not mean absolute value. They mean cardinality which is a word we used to talk about the size of sets. So the double bars me cardinality and for now, we're not going to talk about the cardinality of a set on its own. We're always going to relate the cardinality of things are going to say about are going to have a greater than equal sign in between two cardinalities. We're not going to say the cardinality of a set is some specific number because we're not going to Define all these Notions of infinity. That's really why I don't want to do that yet. I'm so we're going to have these statements like the cardinality of a set a is no bigger than the cardinality of a set be so that the number of elements in a is less than a number less than or equal to the number of elements in b.  And then this is the notation we're going to use.  And one way to demonstrate those are the definition of how we're going to demonstrate this is that if we can come up with a one-to-one function for the from the then we know that there were enough elements and be for all the elements in a and we can conclude this less than or equal to on the backside of the Visa these three statements which one of these are true and then we'll talk about filling in justification for each one where the justification for each one would have to be can't write a one-to-one function or here's the one-to-one function that works. So let's answer this question first.  In the definition of S2 is on the worksheet. It's just to be clear to say I say it out loud to S2 is the set of DNA strands of length 1 or 2 length 2 or less.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay.  All right. So I want you to try and come up with some let's cease. Actually. There's a variety of owl Show the answers to Segundo Show the answers on so4 a seems like we're pretty like there's a bunch of people said all of the above and a bunch of people said a and so what would it look like to justify this for a so let's pick a justify it and we can talk about the others being true and false. Was it look to Justice look like to justify this for a well. It means that we have to write a function.  who is  Domain is 123 and whose range is the bases.  And we have to make sure that for every element in the input. There's a distinct element of the output chosen as the result.  So, let's see what they look like. We can say half of one is the definition.  iff of two is TCF of three is d  the function because it works over the it works for every element of the domain and it's one to one because all of the different inputs give a different output. If I did something like that both of you produce a then this would not be a one-to-one function function, but it wouldn't it wouldn't demonstrate the elements in the domain for every elements in the domain of a function that demonstrates it and we can talk about for all week in domain. I having different.  Annotations of finite we could just let them out. So I want you but I want you to do for a minute is come up with justifications for these two.  Or arguments why we can't build the function. This one's one for these two why we cancelled the one-to-one function. I want you to come up with a right to demonstrate how to do the multiple ways that we could do this for these to try and write the functions that would justify it or are you why the function can't work for one or both of these?  Cardinality of the set containing atgc being no bigger than the cardinality of the set as to which is all the two length of DNA strands when we have to Define for this for function here to demonstrate that worked demonstrate. This is  So the definition of one-to-one is at least one output for the definition of a function is exactly is only having one output. We don't talk about the function having two different answers for the same input function not parting with one.  so f of x is an element of the domain and you said that's equal to a which is a DNA strand of length 2 or less half of  TV is t t e f of G is G G and F of C is CC.  Any other functions we can write the word demonstrate the same thing.  It may even be less westwork in terms of amount of writing I did.  Siri saying another way to write this would be  Since these are two strands of length one or two. We can say there's definitely an element in the output set for each one of these and it's in fact that I want it there. Spray containing just that bass.  Really really short way to write this if we wanted to just talk about generic basis is this just produces the strand of of that one base?  No for this example write these sets are in the domain we can count them and we talked about how many elements are in the range but it's useful to think about where this where this will go with numbers. We're going to start writing functions that take numbers and for example integers and try and produce a corresponding rational and things like that. So the next example actually gets it some other some other interesting problems. We could have enough space because it's picking up with a one-to-one function do not set of Paris to be that Stu's song about that for a second. So this is the end. I'm just going to write this is a 2G here actually before workout capital B.  let's try and demonstrate that we have one-to-one function here suggestions for how we could do this or why we can't  Then you can be able to.  Yes, you're saying if I pick if I'm writing an F for the domain, is this a Cartesian product the bases?  And I have something like a then I can make that P The Strand just contaminating water and we can just go through the list and do this for every single pair.  Which if we wanted to write it?  Symbolically and save a little bit of work just right over here as ask who's going to be the same function we can say that this function takes these pairs and just concatenates the two bases together.  One thing it's interesting to ask about this example is interesting to notice about this example is it this doesn't quite use all the elements in the domain have to find a distinct element in the elements in the domain is all the elements in the works for all the elements in the domain. We have all the possible pairs written just in this function notation, but we don't use any of the strands of the codomain. So there's these four elements of the codomain that aren't used to want to talk about which elements of the codomain are used for leftover.  So all of these end up being true.  All of the above was true for these and the justification for General sets in this is how we're going to talk about doing this for generals is that we write these functions that are one to one that demonstrates this direction of the inequality of sizes.  There's definitely the other direction we want to talk about you want to talk about this relationship. So here's an interesting question, which is if we know that the cardinality of a is less than or equal to the cardinality of the cardinality of a right. That's an interesting question to ask.  Play 5 4 3 2 1.  So few people gave my favorite answer yet. My favorite answer. So this is a nice intuition.  Know the size of the cardinalities of sets. We've said or a little bit funny right because we have Infinities as potential cardinalities of Seth. One of the challenges we're going to have is talking about that situation to be nice of this hell because that if this were true because then we could use what we know about numbers and integers in relationships to think about sizes of sets. So hold off on if that's possible until we see the definition  He is definitely not true. We don't know that when there's a one-to-one function a to be that there must be a one-to-one function be today. Where are there were those four elements in the input that we didn't use we have trouble writing a one-to-one function in the other direction because of that sort of see what that looks like. I'm so be is definitely not true C is an example of like the counter example for be demonstrating the true statement relates to this question were asking about having one to one functions of both directions. So what are we even asking first this greater than sign just with the definition of one-to-one. My favorite answer right answer here, except he is definitely a true statement, but may not relate to this.  And only two of you said you don't know.  Actually, I actually want to congratulate the people who said I don't know.  Because I think that's probably accurate for more than two people because some of these are very fuzzy answers. However, I'm also Happy People Gas customer care people think the people who said I don't know. Yeah, I don't think there's a very good answer for this question on this slide. So that's a pretty accurate response aside from we having to find it yet. Right. We're going to find it yet is also pretty accurate answer. All right, cool. So other than one to one functions onto function, which is that entire output set for the entire codomain is used. So by the idea with one to one is that there's a distinct answer for every input. The idea with onto is that the entire codomain has some element that maps to it.  Codomain or uses all the elements in the domain for some output. And so that's like an interesting duel or an interesting complementary property to being one to one and we can ask these other questions about talk about what it would mean to right onto functions to justify. These directions are literally flipping the order from the last one and putting greater than or equal to do you believe all these statements are there when you don't believe  5 4 3 2 1 on to I want you to think about which what you give is justification for all of the above. And I'm going to agree with you that it's all of the above justifications look like in this case what functions can you construct the demonstrate this onto relationship between the left hand side and right hand side functions describing the domain and range men describing the specific values that come in and out.  the first one what is a justification for this first one look like  Oh, thank you.  Bihar David expectation for that look like  it's like  a 40 or a lapse of one do you have to be to do in GMC.  Yes, I'm one of the important things you did hear is you gave and an actual input output for this last element. It would not be enough to just Define for a T and G the function as to consider. The whole domain property we care about is that the entire codomain is used which is one two, and three here, but the important that has an answer for every element of the domain often. We have to take sort of the extra elements and give some meaning for the extra elements. So for example on the jump to the the middle one is actually good for indicating us as well. Right if we want to demonstrate this  We can talk about both. We have to talk about both what happens if the Strand is like one and if the Strand is links to hear Define the function for some elements.  If the Strand is like one we could just get back that bass and that's going to be an element of a t g c and not a part of the definition makes it be on 2 if we have a strand of length two, then I could just pick one of the bases actually our Computing some element in the domain, but we actually we're due at the Define it for all the elements that are in the domain.  the same thing for the last example wear for the length two strands we would need to do something for the give them some kind of a sew in the last case we end up with something like  producing this pair  and then justifying that  We cover the entire codomain with the second rule for the first rule actually makes it cover the entire domain.  This was further.  This case has several ways to write these we could always list these out and these are definitely not the only answers for these we can pick two different ways of writing a few of these were talking about sizes of sets is compared is use these functions both one-to-one and onto functions to compare them.  So there's this definition of the word we're going to use this word is digestion.  The talks about two sets having a one-to-one function having a function is both one-to-one and onto so it's not exactly Maps one element of the input the one element of the outfit.  The word invertible is nice here too. Because since there's this exact one-to-one mapping you can always take an element of the domain and find out exactly what the elements in the domain and came from something important. For example, when you encrypt something you really care about different ways of it being invertible you want the person who can read the secret message to be able to invert it that you don't want other people to be able to invert it. So this property ends up being really related to thinking about the inputs and outputs of encryption algorithm and end up mattering a lot on Krypton to a larger or smaller than a set of messages during christening.  Finally just let us Define a nice notion of equality here where we have this less than and greater than relationship. But also we can talk about equality with there being a bijection.  and you can also do this by proving if you want to demonstrate equality, you can prove either one of these things and also get also get the air quality in terms of cardinality, but they have the same size and you can prove both directions of less than honorable directions with greater than  And you get to this same cardinality.  One thing I realize is blank on your Shih Tzus probably worth doing is just making sure we go and fill in the definition of onto.  So up here we said onto so what the what the symbolic definition of she wanted.  When's right this out formally?  Yeah.  And which set does be come from?  Yeah, so a becomes from the set see which is the codomain and it comes from the set D which is the domain which artist makes all the definitions.  okay, that's why I finished a few minutes early so I can take any questions you have and if people want to be done they can be done so I can take any questions at folks having General before we wrap up cuz we have  yeah.  Yeah, if with two s's if it only has so you can think of it as divided as a biconditional so proving either one being proved demonstrates the other.  Yeah, what's up?  Yep.  So you're coming to see if f of x equals x movie is false as equal to be then the implication would evaluate to true but you two elements of two elements in the domain if that were true. Then the function would not be one to one.  Rights, so the idea is to go back to the definition.  This one you're saying you're asking what happens if this is false, right? So  let's think about an example of this you're saying if this is false then a could still be equal to be.  And this whole thing would evaluate to true.  Yes, I think what's happening there is that say more about the function not being well defined in the case that the case and function is not well defined them.  Yep, that's the right description. Thank you. So the idea there would be you would have won value cuz they supposed to be in there's two different answers for it. So it wouldn't be a function one to one either but it wouldn't be wouldn't be a function one-to-one function already every element of the domain. There is only one element of the codomain it would take for it.  So who says that we're going to every single elements in the domain is going to be covered.  And so we just have to if we just have to find some element in the domain that produces that element and so I don't think we could just pick one elements in the codomain and make this work because otherwise we would we be able to find some other elements in Dakota minutes.  sandiego.edu "
