    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Okay, let's get started.  Good morning, everyone. Welcome back. And let's just want to have a few quick announcements and I want to dive back into talking about number representation. The only reminders I want to make sure I give you are when we have deadlines coming up. So get used to the start of sequence of deadlines in the course the follow-up for the introduction of notation assignment for calling zero follow up tomorrow evening. And then the warm up for homework 1 is due tomorrow evening, then that'll be due next Monday. So Thursday is you should expect these follow-ups and warm-ups to be do and then Monday evenings expect the homework to be to be getting some questions coming and remember that the follow-up the follow-up you should be working on alone the homework so you can work with a partner and the warm-ups. Feel free to talk to anyone about those questions in the warm up.  The one that have the sort of multiple choice check boxes text box answers on gradescope and the others you'll be typing up in submitting a PDF.  questions about any Logistics before we get started  Okay, cool, so I want to talk about negative numbers today we didn't talk about negative numbers on Monday and so I won't extend their representations to talk about those things if you interesting choices we can make with negative numbers and then I want to talk about representing logical operations and we're going to have a couple representations for doing doing Logic on bits on zero and those are going to help us understand how computers are physically built so we're going to work through some of those things today too, but I want to and I'm bringing up our definitions of the positive integers first because these are what we're going to extend the expansion of a number and then we refined it to talk about it being fixed with the big deal on Monday is having numbers being in a particular base  Leading zeros on the representation of the number for basically we had a fixed set of coefficients. We were allowed to use and this is how computers represent binary representations of numbers that we use all over the place. So this fixed with representation is pretty important and the key idea for doing representations that are negative is to say we are going to use part of this with usually one bit worth of that with or one digit or one coefficient of that with to represent negativeness for whether the number is it positive or negative number and what the rest of the digits in the number mean? There's a few different representations. We could try a few different definitions. We could try and three of those common ones in these are what we're going to explore in figure.  Why some of these are actually I would say better than others are called sign magnitude ones complement into I don't want to read them at you to take a second read these definitions talk about them for a second. I'm never going to do a bunch of examples with read these definition. We're going to do a bunch of examples.  All right, so I want to go through a few of the examples that are on on the worksheet now. So the worksheet asks you to think about two specific numbers and asked you to think about 15 if I want to start working through those so that we can see what they look like any different representation.  Take me to First Row this road sign magnitude of representation says we're just going to use the leading bit are the leading coefficient is positive or negative and then the magnitude of the digits. I'm so if we wanted to represent 15 + sign magnitude, and I'm going to pick 6 as the winds that I'm going to use for all of these so we can use with with sticks that also matches the example at the bottom is with six. That just means we have to calculate these examples. This means we do the usual calculations / 15 + 4 + 2 + 100 in an eighth place before his place the tooth place.  In the ones place that would be 15 and sign magnitude the positive hurt. And then if we had 15 + negative version, it's going to be the same magnitude just with a negative sign in the front same magnitude, but with a negative sign in the front and the negative sign is represented by this one.  This is a reminder that one place to his place 4th. Place 8th. Place are there is a 16th Place in this number that zero and then that leading coefficient is representing positive or negative sign magnitude. These will be representation of a 15 + -15.  Trysting with with with the whip sticks take take a couple seconds and think about what one's complement is going to look like before I do it. What's the ones complement road going to look like? It's going to be different. So think about both of these for the ones complement Row for 15. + -15  Alright, so is the first one though the representation is 15. How does that what does that look like? What does representation of 15 look like in this one's complement representation positive 15 look like  Be the same be the same any other.  Yes, actually this definition looks to be exactly the same for all of them right actually if the numbers are positive  the definitions are exactly the same -15 + -15  Yeah.  inverted version of positive 15 description based on summarizing the definition of the coefficients look like  What specific coefficients?  Is the first bit going to be 0 or 1 and shout it out one? Okay, what about the second one next one? And so this is what we mean by inverted right? We're going to take all of those digits in just flip them from 0 to 1 representation about the two's complement representation of -15 whose complement representation. What's that going to look like? It's not going to look like  look like  What you talked about this one for a second just going to give a short amount of time for this come up with I want you to write down and come up with is going to work After the two's complement representation of -15/32. Really, right? This really are trying to write this down into the storm.  Alright any suggestions for the two's complement of negative fifteen suggestions who want to give it a shot?  What's the first coefficient going to be times that right? What's the next electrician going to be?  I heard one in there. That doesn't mean that so I'm going to put a load? What's the last digit so there is something we can sort of check this against the formula is given for two's complement. Now, there's a couple ways to go about calculating the compliment but we can we can just check now that we have a potential answer. So the definition says that we're going to have this equation satisfy whatever this Space 2 expansion represents.  The 2-1 in this case, that's two to the five and mine is annwyl and is the number we're trying to represent in the number. We're trying to represent his 15, that would be 32-15. So that means we want the base 2 expansion of 17 as the rest of the number and silver trying to represent 15 V, which is 32 - 15 that but we should get for this part of the number one in the 16th.  There's another way to go from a to get a to supplement number which is an interesting trick that works out, which is you do the same thing you do for the ones and then add one to the number to do the same thing you do for the ones complement and add one to the number and that's another trick for calculating into this formula is enough to usually figure out what you want to do because if you have end provided it's easier to calculate if you are trying to find an given you can use this formula to figure it out as well. So this formula is a really nice constraint to know about this is the obvious thing to try first and then there's these other ones. I want to ask a couple questions about about about using one over another  So the first question is about 0 we're doing all of this flipping of these coefficients from zeros were using one at the beginning of the number 2 mean different things under stand where there are zeros in this representation. So which of these numbers represent 0 and what would 0 look like in each one?  5 4 3 2 1  Just got this one briefly this a little bit of variety of answers that people gave so just got this one.  Okay. I'm going to leave this open for another 30 seconds picking again with an updated answer for this question based on discussing with folks around you.  5 4 3 2 1  All right, so I want to just look at ABC in order and we can say something about each of them. So kind of uncontroversial. It's definitely just a binary representation no matter which one of these we pick actually this gives us a representation of zero because we're saying that we're not doing any of the interesting complimenting or flipping the actual magnitude of the number is 0 I'm so this is definitely at least one representation of 0.  0111 and 1 complement leading. The leading coefficient is 0 which means we're on the left hand side of the definition and that means they were using definition. We're real magnet has the entire entire value of the number. So the magnitude is going to be seven. This doesn't represent zero. When is the leading zero we're just adding up the coefficients to the right power as usual.  Siri is an interesting case don't see where he's talking about a leading one.  Play nine all zeros in the two's complement representation. So leading one and then all zeros in the tooth complement representation. So what is this? What is this mean in terms of the formula that we have for two's complement? We're definitely on the right hand side. So we're going to be using this equation examples.  For so this is going to be saying 2 to the 3 - n is equal to whatever the rest of the mind so whatever the rest of the coefficients represent and the rest of the coefficients are a000. So we're looking at this equation, which is 2 to the 2 to the 3 - 0 is what this must represent that means that n is equal to 8.  According to this equation this number 1000 in base 2 in two's complement represent. -8 the leading one means it's negative calculation to make weave check these off as knowing what they are, but these are not zero, so just to be clear indicating which ones were only a represents here.  And there's this interesting thing going on with with representing -8. That's kind of interesting. Can we represent positive compliments or complements with only four of them positive eight?  We represent positive 8 the biggest number we could represent would be well be actually kind of tells us he has is positive 7 and that's the largest number we can represent with zero as the leading coefficient the most negative number one bigger than at least in to stop at least.  Another question that's worth asking is what are the representation representation or representations of 0 in 1 and 2's complement. How can we represent 0 in 1 and 2's complement? We saw it for just regular binary. We do it for one and two complement. We need to talk about this for a second. What what are they are there more than one is there just one is compliment if we wanted to represent zero about that for a second. What are the representations of zero?  Alright, so what are some thoughts here? What are some thoughts here about zeros and ones and twos complement zeros and ones and twos compliment.  And we can stick with Win 4 for the last example.  I'm just saying it's actually worth pointing out that first example all zeros definitely works in both of these 00 the other suggestions for one's complement four ways to represent zero.  0 + try this right to one's complement tells us the leading coefficient is 1 so it's negative number is complimenting all the other negative zero zero zero base, which is negative zero.  -0  has two ways to represent zero negative zero doesn't mean much different than zero interesting to talk about the idea of why negative zero might be a different value than zero in the math. We know math were talking about where we're just using integers. There's no difference between a 0 * -1 + 0. There's no special value negative zero. So what's happening here is one compliment has two ways to represent the value 00 shows up twice in the one's complement representation one followed by all zeros. That's also a representation of 0.  Interesting Lee in to complement this doesn't happen. Right? We saw in the last side. In fact that one followed by a bunch of zeros doesn't give us zero and a one followed by a bunch of ones also wouldn't give us to euro into compliment. If we do this out that ends up being negative one because of this.  Sittoo's compliment has the benefit that there's only one representation of zero represent that -8 instead of representing zero twice. That's actually what's happening between one's complement to compliment most negative number can be represented instead of representing zero twice if that little extra.  I want to talk about comparing these just in one example here to see why so that's one reason why to compliment might be useful. It may give us this one extra number we can represent. That's nice. But let's talk a little bit about some other kind of comparison we can do here. So what I have at the top and what's on your worksheet is a little bit of arithmetic. So it's a binary arithmetic of these two numbers. You should interpret them as being in days to  And I want to just do out the arithmetic for these to show what we get for a result for adding these two numbers in binary representation. We pick for them whether they're in here we get a zero here we get a zero here and carry a we get a 111.  This is just doing the arithmetic based on these coefficients that we're seeing here and see what it means a nice representation. Think about the others little bit the first the first argument here the first thing at the top, so this is 1101001 place to place 4 8 16 32 + 4.  So 32 + 16 + 4 equals together, we should expect that. Our answer is 57 and we can check that against result of 32 + 16 + 8 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 that's doing the arithmetic in binary with sex binary representation of a binary.  When you to do this next for sign magnitude do this on your own for sign magnitude. What is the first time and represent? What is the second summon represent? And what is the sum represent? If we interpret all three of those numbers that we did in the arithmetic find magnitude numbers on the question being does it still work out sign magnitude representation?  But if you want keep going onto ones and twos compliments, which we'll talk about next.  All right. So what is this top number the top number? 1 1 0 1 0 0 what does that represent in Sign Language? What does what number does that represent integer?  Raise a hand against the number to the top one represent.  -15 negative  So you're doing the bottom?  Yeah, okay. So starting with -20 is the the top one and then we'll we'll get down to talking about those results. So the first time and was -20 and 16th Place in the forest place that magnitude of 20 and then the negative because of the leading one answer that we should get if we do out the math, right? So I'm going to split this into two different ways of thinking about this. So this is the math answer right? We would hope that we produce -15 if we do out the math here.  What is the value of result that we got bit wiser?  -25  oops  So this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what it means is that we can't just do the regular add and carry process for adding together to sign magnitude numbers that does not work to add to sign night or two numbers. If you want to add to sign magnitude numbers, you need to do more work the first check was positive and negative then figure out if you're adding or subtracting basing up based on if it's positive or negative in this. In fact, you can't just do a regular edition process.  At does not produced answers that are faithful to what we would expect math to do.  So this means this just means that we have to be more careful. When we do arithmetic with these compliment just look like for one's complement. What's the negative the first number in one's complement?  first number one's complement  One's complement.  -11 of 11 degrees of this is that would be we think about the magnitude of that in one's complement. We're looking at 01012 that gives us -11  if we had -11 and 5 together the math answer we would hope to get is -6 and then we should result represents -6 in 1 complement.  Flat bottom result 111001 everything about the magnitude of that in one's complement that's 00110.  That's 6 so the bitterest mistake answer for what we did above answers what gives the same answer is what we would hope to get.  That's pretty cool.  That's pretty interesting.  How about 4 to what is the top number represent in twos complement representing two's complement?  top number in twos complement  . Is up make sure we make sure we know what we're looking at here. We're looking at 1 this is the expansion for the magnitude part of it.  And we're saying that should be equal to 2 to the missus. Would 602 to the 5 minus whatever and we're trying to find who the five minutes whenever and we're trying to find the right is ones Twos for is 8/16 + 16 + 4 that's going to be 20 that we're representing with the magnitude there.  3232  is 20 + 20 + and just moving numbers around here while I'm due does not do what I expect.  And so this is -12  is interesting is also related to the trick I said for you can flip the digits and add one. So you'll often see these relationships when you look at ones ones and twos compliments numbers to look like this.  So we should hope to get a -7 out of make sure where I want to cover lecture today. In fact This falls out as being the right arithmetic results as well.  Compliment compliment have the benefit that even though they represent a mix of positive and negative numbers when we do.  We can get answers that reflect what we want to get in actual math.  So we can get these answers out that reflect the mathematical answers and that's pretty cool and it's a good reason to use ones and twos compliments as a representation inside a computer because it makes implementing arithmetic easier inside a computer because the computer end up not having to do extra work differentiate between these number is is to complement numbers we can just do regular edition arithmetic on them as a result of the two properties. We've talked about one property being at math works out and the other property being that represent one more number than one compliment.  What we end up having is that this is used by computers.  Most most hardware and most of all systems are built to use a two complement representation of integers when negative numbers are needed in base because of these properties.  That's really interesting. Yeah, so you're asking if we had an example you're saying is  What if we had zero one and I'm just going to do it in four bits to be?  Take me to make it short. So you're saying if we added these together, no, definitely in the unassigned world. This totally makes sense. And we would get a butt in the signed world. What does mean for the representation we get out what happened? And so if the answer here for the arithmetic is this week and see what value would get out in twos compliment. And in fact, you've shown with this example where this fixed with limitation comes in. So 1000 as we saw on the slide with a multiple choice question is the most we added up we sort of got to the limit of the positive numbers we could represent and then wrap wrapped around to -8. The positive side came back on the negative side.  Represent with those sort of w - 1 W - 2 part of the number and we're going to wrap around me very formally as we start talking about the mod operation and remainders and using them with the allowed range. It actually sort of you can have these interesting things come up on you and you do actually get a consistent understandable answer it's not nonsense. It's just you can't represent positive 8 in for a bit signs to compliment. So you end up with you end up getting another number.  the great buster  some other questions about this because this is this is a move on to something else next to this is sort of the last the last going to have up above these representations in the the punch line here is this is why we use to compliment  I'm sorry why we change the first?  Big question. Why do we sing the first time in but not the second some in so when the leading coefficient is 0 presentations of the same there and so it could be the start of a reminder self a bat in the definition. Is it the Left End really is  Can you answer questions about these representations of numbers before we go on?  Why would the computer is a too small for men over the ones complement? It's nice to be able to represent one more number and it's nice to know that you have zero without having to compare it to two different values. So if you wanted to ask if a number is equal to 0 you might have to ask is that he will deposit of 04 is it equal to -0 and there's more work to do there to do that checking and so having the unique representation of zero is nice. You also get the extra representation of that most negative number so you can represent more numbers.  So I guess you saying that that like checking.  That's interesting. So you're asking about if the computer is doing this extra operation to Inver bits and add one in this thing about this arithmetic. They do the same arithmetic operation. Like we just did we did the same arithmetic operation and then if we interpret it is to compliment we get the right answer and if we interpret it as we get the right answer the key thing about it is that we don't do any extra work somewhere. We would be forced to confront this to representations of zero all the time, right and into some point. We're not forced to confront that does the difference between what the computer is doing to do these operation.  Programmers are we as algorithm designers would have to think about equality meaning.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Let me let me I'm just going to rearrange the this so that it's above here cuz these were the two Wright these were really the two parts here that where the the summons for one's complement. So that's why the calculation out for how I figured out that 12 was the magnitude here. So other people can requisition talking about the next the next directly related to a lot of the conversations. We just had about representing.  File binary numbers in binary operations we need to do with a low at a low level in a computer to actually build this.  And the high-level picture here is that computers physical machines represent in one of the fundamental building blocks for building up a computer is I get it taking circuits that have voltage is coming in on multiple wires and cause different voltages to come out. We're not going to think hard about electricity and voltages in this class. We're going to say that every wire is either carrying a 0 or a 1 on it. But with all of the understanding we've just got from what it means to do bit by bit arithmetic we can start to think about what kinds of operations we want these circuits to be able to do and given some circuit we can build up some of these operations like arithmetic and interpreting numbers in interpreting numbers.  So the idea here is we're going to draw certain shaped boxes that represent particular operation that convert incoming ones and zeros to outgoing ones and zeros going to be our model or a representation and what's going on inside Hardware.  So I want to talk first about the first example I want to do or you talk about circuits pretty generally in the course, but I want to bring this back to the example you've seen so far which is doing this bit by bit or one column at a time edition of zeros and ones and there's a few things that this relied on this relied on the ability to add two symbols together. So that adds to single digits together to single coefficients together and bring this out in going from this column to this column. I wrote down at Cary up here when I went from third to Fourth column from right to left and implicitly and all the other columns.  I was carrying a zero right? There was nothing carried over from the past few last things involved here to be really explicit in calculating this out. We need to be able to add single digits and then do this carrying operation.  No, we as people who learned arithmetic in our lives.  I had to start somewhere with sort of the ground Truth for what it meant to add a single-digit together and in addition right there. And when we do addition this is actually getting a little bit back to the question of what if we add a number that's too big to represent when we do addition if the number fits inside but then in this triangle the bottom half of this picture you get these interesting cases.  For example 5 + 5 digit you right when you do arithmetic there would be zero when you do 5 + 5 + you ever carry the digit 9 + 1 + 0 + you keep track of a carry the same picture for the binary addition table one if we had zeros and zeros we have zero and if we add a 1in the one the resulting digital zero with a carry same logic as what we learn to do when we learn to do digit by digit arithmetic and based on just simplified and thinking about this case where we add together to ones and get a 0 and it is important for for building circuits.  I want to talk about what it means to add together these two digits and physically summarizes a bit of what I was saying attention on the right hand side of the screen here, which is in base 2, which is a weekend wrong output. Swear i a s here is the result bit and then is the salmon C is going to Stanford Carrie and this is all the possibilities just like this.  It's what we're going to do is talk about a building up circuits that can do these operations. And this is what they were going to talk about look like so like I said, there's going to be wires coming into boxes and then wires coming out of boxes and we're going to talk about values of zero in one that flew across these boxes and produce results.  and this is  the set of we call the logic gates or this is the circuit that's going to produce a one symbol some that are coming in and then these two outputs with some in the Carrie Beth are coming out.  And we can show exhaustively what all of those things are going to be and I just want to highlight these shapes or shape for going to be seeing a lot. So we're going to do differently shaped boxes with a word in them represent these different operations. And in fact, these tables are summarizing what we mean by Exo are in an so and this is a one bit exactly when the two inputs are both one. Otherwise, it produces 0 + x or produces one bit exactly when the logic gate that we use to build up circuits and these two together X or and and in this configuration describe one digit addition.  So one question I want to ask for this is going to be how I wrap up the class today is by asking this question, which is a bit of a speculative question because we're going to talk about is how to do a large editions of many many bets like the ones that we did with 6 is how many single digit addition do you think we need to do in order to two two digit binary numbers to two digit binary numbers. How many one bit Psalms do you think her involved here in adding these up? I'm just going to have you discussed for the one minute that's left and then I get answers in and I'm going to close it down.  UC San Diego podcast "
