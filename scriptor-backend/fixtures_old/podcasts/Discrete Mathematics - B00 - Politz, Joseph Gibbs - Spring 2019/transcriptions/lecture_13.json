    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. So just a reminder. The first exam is Wednesday evening at 7. We put a post on Piazza with all of the logistics details about the exam sample questions that we wrote that we thought would be good for you to practice and Simple Solutions for them and a listing of some problems from the books that are interesting for practice to I suppose so if you can use all that use all that stuff repair. Today, what I want to do is get more into talking about Seth. We've used them a little bit in this course, we've talked about set builder notation. We've talked about listing out the content their contents with roster notation. We've talked about the truth set of predicate. So we've used sets in several ways, but we haven't defined a whole bunch of operations on sets and we haven't really worked with sets and sets just doing operations on sets and talking about working with them directly. So they're going to be in the forest for a lot of reasons and we're going to build up more interesting domain for predicate by talking about interesting set. So I want to spend some time diving into that today. We're going to do some proofs about sets today. Another nice thing about them is they give us several opportunities to talk about interesting properties and then justify those properties are true or come up with counter-examples for them. And so there's a few things that I want you to have in mind when you're looking at these problem.  That you need to be able to read the slides in order to really engage in lecture 100% So we'll see if this works for the podcast but that's frustrating that that work. All right.  so  There's a few things I want you have in mind whenever you see these claims, right? We've been talking a lot about these Universal claims with for all these existential claims with exist. And then we've been building a Roof Inn Universal generalization. And so there's a few things you should do whenever you're confronted with one of those properties and homework 3 is actually trying to get you to get you to think about a few of them one is about what the statement means in English just do a little bit of sense making on the statement for what it's trying to say and then try and come up with examples of what you could provide for the variables that are in the farala exist and see if that hangs together for you doesn't make sense at all when you substitute some variables and sometimes you can even just come up with a counterexample by playing with it a little bit.  So I'm trying to come up with small examples. That's also a great way to generate questions for us for the corestaff. If you say if you come to us and say I don't understand this for all this statement like okay, but if you come to us and say I don't understand this for all these this statement if I feel in this DNA strand for the first variable in this number for the second variable, I don't get what the body of that is saying we can help you a lot more. So trying to fill in the small examples are trying to do a little bit of example building yourself. That's just ask  Then if you're trying to figure out if one of these things is true or false and you can't find a counterexample with a few small example, then you can start thinking about is it an existential Universal crew strategies apply here and then start trying to pick the tool that's appropriate and seeing how you can make progress. But I really want to encourage you whenever you see one of these properties. The first thing you do is try and think of some examples for the variables and try and think about what that would mean if you were to say it out loud in English just doing symbolic manipulation and diving into a proof is often not the right first thing to do. So do a little bit of sense making first and then move on to thinking about what strategies are appropriate for the thing you're looking at a few times today.  And just to highlight the two new things we've been using is in the last couple lectures is this idea of universal generalization where we pick an arbitrary element in the domain to prove after all and then this idea of direct proof working with for a while.  Let's move on to talk about a definition for asset and then we'll be able to talk about operations on set in the future when you come in late. I'm not going to put these here because I don't like having people walking in front of me. They're going to be here.  all right, so the definition of  sets4us  is going to be that sets are collections of elements and there's a couple important things about these are a couple laughs almost like lack of properties about sets one is that they don't have any specific order to their element there an unordered collection of elements.  And another that's kind of implicit in this definition from the book but is also true is that they don't have any duplicate elements.  So whenever we talk about a set we'll talk about it being a collection of distinct elements and the same element and there's no duplicates in a set.  And then there's a few definitions here. These are on your hand out to First Data quality and these ideas of subsets and proper subsets because I want to get onto asking move on to ask me some questions about them.  So here's them because the definitions up here even refer to them and also and I just want to ask which ones of these are true based on these definitions definitions.  5 4 3 2 1  all right, click in again with the results of discussing this  Okay, 5 4 3 2 1 verse 1 the set of integers is a proper subset of the set of rational number. So that means if we want to relate these things were going to say all the integers rational numbers, but there's something that's different between the two sets. We can find some element that's in one set. That's not in the other set a clear about rational number is anything that we can write as a fraction of two integers. So this is often written in numbers. We can write as n / n where n is an integer and M is an integer and that's the set of rational numbers is things that are 1 integer divided by another.  Integer, then it could be a rational number. So if  and exists in the integers then and exists and Q and we can show that by say well and over one away to write. This is a rational number.  And that exists in cute and also the mathematical interpretation of that is the same as that the same as a tennager miniature and I'm sure when you were thinking about this a lot of those jump to mine rational numbers that are not integers things like 1/2 is a rational number but one half is not an integer and so that justifies the different parts of this part.  Is that the integers are a subset of the rationals? And then this part is that there's something  that is in one of the sets but not in the other set. So those are the two pieces that we need to talk about being a proper subset.  The next one the empty set is an element of 01 to nobody answered. Nobody picked this a c and a couple of none of the above of 012 are 0 1 and 2 is a subset of that set an element of it. We have to actually write the empty set is an element of it. So that's definitely not true.  Adam is next plan that for all sets A and B. If a equals B, then B is a subset of a important thing here is that in subsets is the normal subset definition this one.  And I should have just use another color this ask for a subset not proper subset.  Two sets that are equal are subsets of one another are not proper subsets of one another but they're subsets of one another because every element that exists in one does exist in the other that's true in both directions. So C is C is true as well.  Hernandez at 40379 is a subset of the set containing 9af and zero definitely not true. For example, the element 43 got the element 43 doesn't isn't in the other it isn't in the other set. So that direction doesn't.  Okay, so this definitely doesn't work any answers. None of the above. There's two different elements are two different things that were true in this list questions about the definition of subset proper subset empty set.  questions about these  and talk about a couple of planes. And actually I think there is a difference yet on the slide that says proper subset. I'm just going to  Get rid of that make it exactly match the worksheet cuz I just want to ask regular subset. So it's not proper subset. This matches with a cpg is a subset of this other set containing AAC specific integers to using set builder notation. Do you would use for proving none with each other just for a minute to talk about these two from it?  All right. So let's talk about this claim on the left hand side first. So first of all, let's talk about whether we think it's true or false if it's true hum.  If it's someone's info.  If it's false hum.  So this claim is not true and went and what strategy do we end up using to prove that it's not true. What's the best way to disprove this statement?  Counterexample example because the definition of subset is a universal statement. So if we wanted to rewrite this in terms of its definition what we get is that we're trying to show just the subset definition for this and one thing that I often find useful. If I'm trying to make these arguments about sets that are written and roster notation station is I'll give them names so I might say I make all this set are in this set s rewriting out all the elements for all X and now just looking at my definition of subset here.  Acts in our implies X in s definition of subset and so that's why we have to show until we have after all we could disprove it with a counterexample, or we could prove it with universal generalization. Those are our choices and it's pretty direct to see that there's some elements in the left hand side that aren't in the right hand side so we can say by counterexample.  Give me a counterexample. What should I choose as my counterexample?  What should I choose? What does it mean to choose a counterexample?  Yeah, true Xanax. Yeah, so give me an X. Give me an X. Okay, so by counterexample and we're choosing a specific value here. Then we can say look there's this very concrete thing to show which is that in our implies implies.  A n s is false if we can show that that's false then we have a counterexample and this is definitely true.  by the definition of the left hand side set by looking at the definition of our  this is definitely false.  By definition of s we just look at us threatening roster notation. We can check if a isn't any of those elements that produces false this whole thing produces false.  I'm just riding out true and false in some cases when there's other teas and other letters were around in the problem just to be totally clear. But this is this ends up being true.  So x equals a  is a counterexample  and we're done and we could if we wanted we could say something like cutie to sort of indicate to the reader that that last statement is the statement that justifies our whole claim which is that we can disprove this.  Anything that I should fix and what I wrote in the proof actually anything that I should fix there anything you do disbeliever is inconsistent across what I wrote in this proof.  And I can I can think of one thing that's why I'm asking I went back and looked at it and thought I can think of one thing. I would like to change about this for what I've written.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got so you're saying I wrote to show is this for all statement, but the proof is not for a frost 8 Minute power proving a for all statement. I would have to do something like Universal generalization really what I decided because I decided I was going to prove this thing is not true. I'm just proving it. I'm showing it not for all X example is the strategy for showing not for all X.  So want to be really precise about the steps I took here right? I'm not that that prove does not demonstrate that for all X. This is true.  Yeah, that's a good question. That's a good question. So you're saying shouldn't we even beat to be even more precise? Should we say?  original to show  ratso  we'd be saying this claim is  not true in our original to show is not.  Are subsets of ass and then we can update our to show and this would be by the definition.  I'm stopped at right and then we working if I was from the problem statement because I do but I would want to duplicate that original a statement. Let us show the two I have the two sets written in the line above.  So right hand side right hand side this other subsets claim on the right hand side. I'm curious people thought it was true or false true or false the word true or false people. Wanted to do the first time true or false.  What's a counterexample for this?  the counter example  five someone said five. So again, this would be a very similar proof. I'm not going to write this one all the way out. I'm just going to sketch the pieces so we would be saying this claim is not true.  Not are subsets of ass and then we get a different to show that the frolics using the definition of subset.  Subset and we'd have a counterexample.  Of x equals five and we would show that and I want to be clear about how we're defining log in this class at this point. It's really one reason to have this example up as well. Is that we Define log to be  Log base 2 that's referring to the log function that we implemented and talked about and so me to find this to be log base 2 and to be the integer log base 2, so it's the smallest so but log of 5 6 and 7 is too so it's the power below the one that exactly logged. The result is to log base 2 and 5 6 7 up to the next power of 2, I'll give the results to as well. So this is log base 2  Round it down or take the floors that result.  That matches the loop that we wrote to calculate law to the beginning at the beginning of the end up with equals to 2 is not equal to 3, so, it can't be an element of the stuff. That's the sketch. I would put more words around this but I want to make sure we get to some more examples to describe this all the way.  A couple more that I want to address. So here's a clean subset is a proper subset of every set and then the one on the right for some set for some set be the empty set is an element of B.  All right.  So the user useful questions to ask mainly because they force us to focus on some simple small cases, which is often useful empty cases and single element cases are often useful for us to get some practice with and understand what's going on. So let's make sure we understand how to State a claim on the left its useful to State it symbolically we can figure out what kind of proof strategy might we might use so we can rewrite the claim as saying for all sets s  The empty set which we could write this way and we could also write this way. I'm going to write it this way because it's written this way over here and we can see both on the same on the same slide. This is a proper subset so that the subset with a little tick mark on the bottom line.  Overall sets the empty set is a proper subset that set Universal here. So we should either be trying to do a universal generalization proof, or we should be trying to find a counterexample whether we're trying to prove or disprove the statement.  Empty empty set empty set the other counterexample.  It's interesting. The claim is.  Choose s equals empty set as a counterexample.  So now we're saying our to show is the negation of this.  So our claim is this claim is not true. This is not what we're showing that this is not a true flame. And so what were to show should be is the negation of the visceral and so the to show that we have is that it's not true. That empty set is a subset of a proper subset of empty set.  And this is a being a easiest to show if we expand the definition of proper subsets, which tells us empty set needs to be regular subset of empty set and empty set should not be equal to empty set.  That's just just by definition of  Proper subset we look at that definition. It says to be a proper subset the two sets must not be equal and the less that must be a subset of the right set. So it's just expanding the definition in place.  And we need to show that the stuff in parentheses is false. So that its negation is true. And I think it's a we could there's a couple things we could do one thing we can say is look.  this is  obviously false empty set not equals empty set their they're clearly equal so that I'm not is obviously false. Then we can reduce this entire claim so we would then say not empty set.  empty set and false  and we know from logical if this is the same as not false because anything and false produces full done because what we've demonstrated here is that  s equals  is a counterexample  And these steps this is this stuff is really by the definition of set equality.  and this step is biological equivalence and the step is  by the definition of negation  it's worth saying that there's a there's a bit of a  there's work that I skipped. If I wanted to talk in detail about the entire definition of set equality. We could expand this thing out further. So let me just draw a little line. We could expand this and let's talk about the definition of equality and we have a definition of set equality, which is that for all x x exists in empty set. If and only if existing empty set and write and that would be by the definition of set equality we could work through the direction of justification for this entire statement.  And I'm choosing here to say that this step is more work.  the necessary  because  empty set knot equals empty set is clear.  And I didn't get the general principle. If you have two sets that are written in roster notation. So these empty sets just don't list their like roster notation. It doesn't list anything and you're asking a question and you can see all the elements that doesn't need additional justification to show that they're equal or not equal right? We can look at the elements next to each other and just see you there with the theory for not equal right there prostitution and it's all fitting on the page in the proof. This is definitely a place where the proof is just doing a job doing a specific job communicating Sgt adding is extra information about expanding out this entire definition for these two sets here doesn't really add anything to our argument of the proof. It's true. All of this is true stuff that would lead to the implication from empty set knot equals empty set to get into a false, right?  The it makes the proof harder to read with little extra information for the reader. So there's some of these simple cases also. This is where we talked about like arithmetic like comparing numbers. We don't go into a deep discussion about how the integers work every time. We compare two numbers with greater than to arrive at a true or false for those two numbers. So some of these Basics comparisons where you can see all of the values written out it's reasonable to say look. I don't need to use the definition of set equality skipping work that could be done. But I think the proof stays clear even without this extra work.  Any questions about that. Proof that demonstration? Yeah.  see  Yeah, that's a good point. So you're saying  you're referring to this one, right? So I think there's two ways to talk about.  Account rate when we choose a counterexample one if I want to make the body false write the body of the universal fall. The other is I want to make the negation of that true and here I wrote the negation there and I ended up trying to make a whole thing true at the end. Does that answer your question?  Yeah, yeah, so it also I think both both things are clear demonstrations of the counter example showing at the body evaluates the false and then evaluate so true and think this is a counterexample and different ones could actually be useful in different cases. Cuz sometimes litigation might let you rewrite The Logical formula in a nice way to demonstrate it things like that. So both are an example question now.  And I want to move on to the examples on the back of the sheet. So I'm just going to be clear about the statement here the to show here if we wrote this symbolically would be there exists or thing for some there exists some set.  I said empty set is an element of be empty set is an element of be in here. We need a witness because we're trying to prove an existential and this ends up being a true statement and so we can choose.  a witness here  Which is a b equal as we could we could also write this as equals and draw the empty set this way, but the idea is that b is a set and one of the elements of B is a set.  Sophie is a set. One of the elements of B is a set and then we can see that the empty set is an element of that food demonstrate that this is a good Witness.  The last claim is false because the empty set a subset of every set but not a proper subset of every set and then the right clean is true. We definitely can construct this set be just as the empty set is an element.  I want to talk about these other definitions that are on the back of one of them is Cartesian product. We talked about that when we started building up these multi-element domains domains. It related multiple values definition definition of power set the talks about all of the Union intersection. So the definitions on The Right Use Union intersection Cartesian product and difference and I just want to ask which of those instructions on the right using these operations yields sets that have the same elements that are equal sets.  5 4 3 2 1  Just got this one briefly.  Okay, look in again and again.  5 4 3 2 1 the results of a few of these operations just so we can just so we can compare to this first operation that does the cross product of the Cartesian product. The important thing to remember about Cartesian product is it is producing this set of pairs. So it takes two sets and produces a set of pairs of their elements. So number one end up producing a set that looks like the pair 43:9 De Pere 43 De Pere Nine-Nine & The Pear 9A  Is a couple things just worth worth mentioning here. You might say wait, that's not allow. There's a duplicate element in that set.  That's not allowed. There's a duplicate element in that set. This is just a pair that happens to have Nine and Nine is the two elements of the ordered pair that element is not equal to any of the other elements in the set. Right? So it's not equal to the pair 43 not equal to the pair 43:9 not equal to the pear 9A. It's a distinct element of the set.  So this is not a duplicate element in the set. Just a pair that happens have the same value and its first and second position did the results of the Cartesian product sort of has a different type than all of the other operations. If this set of pairs nothing else produces a set of Paris,  Union produces a new set that contains  it contains.  43 nine and a note that when I write out that result, I'm not putting two nines in the result because that would be a duplicate says no need to write it down place the meaning of writing down the same value in 43:9 and Union.  the results of the intersection is just  The set containing nine the only element that was common between no sets is the element nine common final the final results. We take the elements on the left hand side. And we remove any elements that are on the right hand side that were in the left-hand side that would remove 9 and the result of this would be the set containing just 43.  That's the meaning of this.  The sex not envy here. So the element has to not be in the right hand set in order to be included in a sentence but none of these are different elements in comparing them would not produce any of those definitions questions about those. Yeah.  Why is a knot in the set difference that's a great question. So if we look at this definition, there's two things that are required.  The element has to be in the left-hand set and it has to not be in the right hand set. And so if we think about the element a here  we be asking is a n  43 nine and is a in nine not in 9 a trip right? So It Isn't So this whole thing.  Okay, so what's going on to sort of because it is not immediately obvious at all whether this claim is true or false.  I at least I think so. I think it's not obvious at all. Whenever this whether this claim is true or false set of these elements of the power set of the set containing the elements 1 2 3 4 5. I want you to take a minute and make sure we understand what I'm feeling. Top Line where the blank is from it talk about it. Try and fill in a little bit of it is just that one two, three, four five.  All right, so I want to know there's not a ton of time left. So I'm going to I'm going to talk through some of this without as much asking questions for just a few minutes. The definition of power says this is all the stuff. We usually right that's with capital letters. And so it's all the sets X such that X is a subset.  Acid in this case as his this one, two, three, four five. If we were to fill it into this definition for this going to move this a little bit below the line for a minute to talk about another way. We could write this out if we wanted to think what does it mean a set of all the sets acts that are subsets of 1 2 3 4 5  so it's a set.  And every element in it is also a set every elements and it is also a set.  And the empty set is definitely a subset of this one, two, three, four five cent. So that's one such capital X.  And then we start to see how well the set containing just one is definitely a subset of this one, two, three, four five song because it has a subset of the elements.  2 is  the set containing two is the set containing three is  the set containing 4 in the set containing 5 is  then the set containing 1 and 2 is the set containing 1 and 3 the set containing 1 and 4 and this keeps going for a while a fairly large. I sat compared to the original size of 5 a lot of elements in here and we go all the way up until we had all the combinations of the elements from one two, three, four five each has an individual set. That's a member of this power set.  So the powers that operation talks about this entire collection of subsets of a particular set. That's what powers that means and it's really a set of all these combinations that are possible to hear what we're saying. Is that a B and C are something in that big list of that we made out of combinations of the elements 1 2 3 4 5. That's really what this w means.  So I must talk about this claim is saying so this claim is saying for all abs and sees that are in this big set. W.  If the union of A and B is equal to the union of A and C then B is equal to C.  If the union of A and B is equal to the union of NC.  What is a couple choices here and there's two there's two things that I would immediately start thinking about when I see this property written down one is maybe I can do a proof by Universal.  generalization where I'll pick an ABC that are arbitrary elements of this set W and start thinking about if I can prove his property using arbitrary B&C the other is I might disprove  by counterexample  and that would mean picking some specific values for a b and c and trying them out seeing what happens if we plug them in into this into this into the statement. So what are some values we can take for a B&C give me some suggestions and they don't have to but I just want some tell you yeah.  So one example is a is one two three, four five trying to do a counterexample. These are just some examples and I think you said a b equals 3/5.  And you said C equals 4545?  And so then we can plug in these values right and we be talking about then let's talk about this statement with these values plugged in and I make myself just a little bit more space a little bit more space. I can right below here and then we could turn this into a proof in a minute. So this would be saying 1 2 3 4 5  Union 3/5 equals  1 2 3 4 5 Union for 5 all of that implies that  3 V is equal to 4/5.  That's kind of interesting because we can immediately see when we plug in these values by picking a different be a B&C that are different the conclusion of this implication is false. Definitely the case that 3-5 is not equal to 4/5 value. It's the truth. So it may not be a counterexample yet. We have to talk about evaluating a hypothesis.  When we evaluate the hypothesis and simplified is Union by the definition of union this turns into just 1 2 3 4 5 equals 1 2 3 4 5 and all of that.  sandiego.edu "
