    "Full Transcript": "Let's get started. I want to continue some of our discussion of different sets of numbers today. We're also going to do another actually quick at the beginning we're going to do an interesting proof by contradiction. And then I want to talk about numbers a little bit. So we did this proof of Alamo last week where we talked about this robot that was on a grid. Can we use it as an example of defining a set recursively we talked about all of the positions the robot could reach so it started some starting Square in our example of started 00 and it's sure it's starting at lemons. We proved was that all of the positions that can reach have the sum of their for even if it starts at a spot that has an even sum and a nice little proof that let us use structural induction in 00 and based on the definition of the set. We can talk about adding up those ones and negative ones and always getting to another even number for the sum of the coordinates and that was the inductive step. We and then I totally wave my hands when we finish the proof and talk about why that meant the robot couldn't reach 1010. That's actually what happened at the end of that proof when we did last week and so it turns out the last step you need if you want to make that proof really precise as a proof by contradiction and it's nice that looks like so conditions up here because it's useful for this proof to be really precise about what we mean by odd and even give some statements that are maybe I'll be there is there's some number such that n is equal to 2 times a number is equal to 2 k + 1 Des fax from his in the book and there's a discussion of it in the book. We believe all this but it's nice of the properties were going to be using  and so the idea here is if we were trying to go from this limo, which said that all the positions the robot can reach have some of coordinates even what is the proof by contradiction look like to prove the robot the robot can never reach 1 0 what does it look like if you want to set this up and say we use proof by contradiction? What is this look like I want to ask is what is going to turn out to be the Assumption we make in this proof by contradiction negation of P. We talked about this thing that we end up assuming as an important step of this proof by contradiction. That's the first thing I want to I want to ask about here.  5 4 3 2 1 answers here. She is a plurality but not a majority.  Nothing to the thing to be thinking about what ends up being the Assumption after we do that.  Okay Quicken again.  5 4 3 2 1 so he's not what we're going to take care. You should discuss away from maybe the initial saying that was easy to it easy to answer but doesn't fit the problem.  So let's talk about how we was to how we would go to mass this to this proof structure. So we need to pick something that's going to be that we're going to use in the are that we're going to use we're going to use proof by contradiction. We need to make sure we can clearly identify with those two pieces are in is that it starts by saying to prove that a statement is true. That's the start of proof by contradiction the thing we're trying to prove.  He ought to be the same. We're trying to prove. What are we trying to prove here?  What's the statement we're trying to prove?  The robot can never reach 1 0 this thing is a nice English description of tea by talking about this set. We have this set big piece that was recursively defined set and so one way to write this is one zero.  Is not in that set of all the positions that can be reached.  That's what that little that little statement that can be reached or trying to prove.  We're trying to get to.  No, we can think about what are what interesting ours are going to be to choose here. I'm going to move our off to the side for a second because there's a useful point to make sure which is that we have some signs that are is going to be a problem, right? That's that's where this is going. I'm so we'll pick an r that works well for that but in terms of using a proof by contradiction, that means that new to show based on proof by contradiction is going to be the negation of P. So that's one zero is in P implies.  are and not our  that's the goal for using a proof by contradiction make it so that we can do this.  And so one interesting thing. I want to point out about the way you end up getting proof by contradiction is it is really the next step here is  essentially always going to be by direct proof.  We're going to assume that negation of P.  Do we have an implication we want to prove the implication? And so we're going to assume this and try and show that are and not are are both true.  Proof by contradiction really if we're talking about this in terms of the strategy leucine to prove and then direct proof gives you the Assumption by assuming the the hypothesis about application these two steps that happen and we're going to make this assumption C.  So we are going to end up assuming the negation of the thing. We're trying to prove and then we're trying to demonstrate that we can prove both some property are and not our carefully. So make sure the problem works out.  how many suggestions for a we should pick for our that would be interesting to choose for our  casting to choose for our properties for our  Choose the sum of the coordinates of any position reachable by the roadside is even interesting. So you're saying symbolically.  Let's summarize. I want to I want to just get the symbolic form of this so that we can talk about if that's the thing. We want to choose so we have for all.  Let's call it.  XY that are in the set big p  x + y is even  Tristan  interesting. So you're saying we can shoot we can just choose the limit here.  Cool, so maybe this is exactly what we want to impeach using here.  Call that are.  Does that work if that's what I was going to choose that works?  Will come next for come next.  I pick something else when I do this, but I did this before but I think this might work.  but if  10 is in  it is not the first part of the proof we did on Monday where we know that our is true that we prove before. We already proved that this for Allstate movie proved it true. That was a structural induction proof. We did last week. We showed that this was this was true based on the definition of p by structural induction. So if our is true already, we only have to show not our to show the RN. Are and how do we disapprove of her all statement? Well, we were trying to prove its negation of a frost so we can think about it as right finding a witness for the negation is true.  And that's interesting. So now we can so I might just to be really precise here rewrite this there exists some X.  This is interesting but soon.  And it's going to be the negation of x + y is even.  So we can find some X and Y that are in pee and then show that x + y is not even then we'll have demonstrated not our and this is just biological equivalent some what it means to negate after all.  And now it seems like it's going to work to choose one zero is a witness here, right? Because we know that one zero it is indeed. That's one of our assumptions. So it's definitely an okay Witness by assumption it matches this for constraints on the domain of the existential cuz we assumed it has to assume this so I'm if we choose  100 as a witness here  we need to show.  1 + 0 is even  And now just by the definition of what it means to be even what it means to be odd. We can finish this off in particular. We can write 1 + 0 as an odd number. If you look at the definition of odd will be able to write 2 * 0 + 1 so it matches the definition of being an odd number and if we know that a number is either odd, or even then it definitely can't be even if it's odd.  so this is definitely True by definition of  even odd  So you proved are we approve not are all we assumed is the negation of the property. We were trying to prove.  10 is not in t  is what we proved we prove that this 1-0 not a set of coordinates. I can't possibly be in this set of reachable for the original property that we stated back up here.  And that ends up being the conclusion of the whole proof.  So we just grab the limo made that limo be the thing that we were trying to prove both is true and not true since we had the existing proof. We know it's true and then we pushed the Assumption through using it as a witness to an existential in this case.  Yeah, that's what I do. I text OnePlus 0 is odd and then like clearly that's true because of the definition of odd and then I showed it was not awed by applying and get to the get to this conclusion.  Yeah, I like making a lemon here. I didn't think of that because it matches what we did on on Monday as well. We sort of pick something. We already knew in that made that I made one half of the RN. Are easy to show. Okay, so that's another instance of proof by contradiction. The main thing I want to say about proof by contradiction will do another one today. But the main thing I want to say about proof by contradiction is make sure you understand what the original thing you're trying to prove is understand the structure of this implication that's being built.  And I understand that you're assuming this negation of this thing. You're trying to prove you're assuming indication of the property you're trying to prove and you can think of it as carefully step by step their Define P&R carefully, then you'll be doing an accurate proof by contradiction.  So I want to talk about number is a little bit more.  Tom and I also want to talk about nested quantifiers a little bit. So the thing to be looking for carefully is that the AP and seas are in different order. They're all for all for all exist in a B and C are in different orders here near the equation in the in the predicate of the same. These are true are true statements.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so this is so close to the top. So close to a tie. You won't know if it's a trick question.  Quicken again  5 4 3 2 1  All right, so I'm a lot so it's not a lot but significant number of folks moved from answers that were made for a day.  Let's see. So why not being see in Unova reason? Why not being see when I describe it? Yeah, go ahead.  I understand. So you're saying let's assume that a counterexample here, then it must be zero, but zero does not is not an element of cuz he plus starts at 1.  That holds for option b and option C. They both have this problem interesting that it's a problem. Let's just say he is greater than C.  I'm in here. So looking still an option b.  Then a must be what?  -8 +  can we get a made it the naturals like big end, and then we would have been able to solve the one with zeros but we still wouldn't be able to solve equations that we'd like to solve and we can't solve the equation. We can't come up with a different kind of look like the same but in order to solve some of these equations with natural numbers including zero, that's why we need negative numbers. This is  This sort of operation. So here I have the same kinds of things with Platinum not extended to times. So let's look at this one. I pick your answers for this one.  5 4 3 2 1  call  Okay, we can again and again.  Okay.  5 4 3 2 1  but it's not all the above. So.  The first one is sort of we went to the including negative numbers in the first one, but it's similar to answers. It's similar properties on the last line for noises choose a + b is I value and we know that that's going to be part of the integers, but we have a sense that that we can do that kind of arithmetic in be by going to all of the integers. We start to solve the problem with options B&C on the last slide. We're now if for example B is greater than  we can choose a negative number for a so we can choose a negative number for a  now seeing saying well if we multiply and be together can we always find a c and that also seems to have a pretty pretty clear pretty clear answer. We can multiply two integers together and just talk about that in a drawer doesn't matter if it's positive or negative. We must talk about multiplying together and there is the result.  Yeah.  So you're saying a equals 2 and C is equal to 1 is a problem just a 1/2 and but I want half is not an integer.  Now there's more equations. We can't solve with integers the ones that involve multiplication.  So clearly we like the rational numbers rational numbers are all the numbers where we can find a numerator and a denominator where the denominator is not 0 we're both the numerator and denominator are integers set the definition and a pretty good definition of the set of rational numbers and now help us solve equations involving involving. We realize that with natural numbers, we couldn't solve all the addition equation. So we had a negative number. So we added the rational numbers to solve a multiplication equation to solve equations.  Which of these are true?  5 4 3 2 1 right answers, but not all of them are true.  Okay Quicken again Quicken again.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so  Which one of these is not true which one of these is not true.  Seam ABD so we can think about the witnesses here. So I'm in a anyting where p is equal to 0 work to pick you with a very large number is the numerator is 0 then the number times itself will be able to zero.  Here we can choose an X. Where is equal to 1 and Q is equal to 1 and 1/1 * 1/1 is 1. This one and see if we can do. Maybe. It's just a and b equals x x x size and get that at least one answer is 3 over 2 equals x any other answers.  Why don't you guys suggest suggest other answers?  What are other answers to the negative 3 over 2 because when we have this bias towards picking the positive is a financier to pick we can also pick based on the definition of rational or negative things like 6 / -4 and all kinds of interesting Witnesses for this and another that we can pick up here also.  So did lots of answers to somebody's work out.  What sea is an interesting question like Hennessy work, but I want to talk about it is an interesting proof by contradiction that speed is not that she has no witness. And in fact, the rational numbers are not enough to solve equations when I care about involving number. I could have gone like one step simpler with a natural numbers is another representation of the natural numbers that's even simpler and we could go further past this but we're doing like the middle of number theory in like 25 minutes. So this is this is this is like the crash course in number theory if you like it take a number 3 course because it's cool stuff more to I just mean like if you're finding this stuff fun, like number three persons are or what you should you should take. I mean, we're not going to abandon numbers. I'm just saying we don't have time to talk about like a really simple  Mission of numbers which is almost like unary all the way through building up the set of all the real numbers that we can't do all that if you like it, that's so let's talk about the square root of 2 for a minute and some interesting mathematical object. Let's talk about it. So which of these are true about the square root of 2?  Impart a reminder about some properties about this number so we can keep track of what's going on here. But 5 4 3 2 1  Great. So this is kind of interesting in that based on what we said about square roots. We might be able to pick a negative number is the answer to the square root of 2. So a is kind of interesting one of the \u221a 2 is positive Aspen to it. Definitely is greater than or equal to one.  The basically just reminding us that \u221a 2 is going to be some number between one and two and it's going to have some big long representation if we tried to write it out with all the decimal. So let's imagine trying to prove that the square root of 2 is not a rational number that seems to be what we're getting at here with the rationals don't include this where we can solve this equation.  So here's one. Here's one potential potential here kind of a a start and maybe a conclusion to a purchase or just taking it and read it.  I heard Rumbles.  What song is this? What song is this?  And it didn't work.  Because it's not a it's not an integer. So yeah.  Just thing him prove that there are no legitimate Witnesses, but it's like it didn't work.  I'm looking for other ways of raising your complaint.  Yeah, so so I like both of these descriptions. I'm going to use some of the words from both of them to describe this what we're trying to show is that there does not exist.  let's say  p over Q that's in the rationals.  with square root of 2 equals p over Q  We're looking for to show not that there's some p and Q that doesn't work, but there is no possible p&q that could work. There's no rational number that could work here, and it was made is this is logically equivalent to for all p over q that are in the rationals.  For attitude is not equal.  Insensitive raw there is no role for a witness here. We're trying to prove her for all so demonstrating. Something is a useful way to explore the property, but it's not a proof we have to do something with induction or Universal generalization or some other proof strategy in order for this to work.  So the main point here is just by negating a witness that doesn't mean that we proved it for all or just by demonstrating one witness. That doesn't really prove deferral talk about this.  In a different way, we're going to use proof by contradiction. And so what we're going to try and say is that the \u221a 2 is an element of the rational right? So that's the existential I wrote above where we going to be able to find will assume that we can find a p and Q that make this true and then we'll be trying to write an implication. Some property is both true and false.  Actually, it's so here's the here's some of the information we're going to need to do it and usable demos that are at the bottom of the back side of the hand out.  And one important definition we are going to need here is this idea of a greatest common denominator? And so I want to just ask a question about the greatest common denominator so that we can be on the same page about what greatest common denominator means this greatest common denominators. What's the largest number that we can find at the factor of both of these number? I want to ask which one of these are accurate greatest common denominator statements. So I think I'll just for a minute and then  But using this in the proof.  Greatest common divisor sorry I said denominator, but the way the books that is says it is divisor. So use that word.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so is not true because we can find a bigger number that divides both be is true. Three is the biggest number that will divide anyone see is not true.  Because 3 doesn't divide 7 degrees not a factor of 7 and then D is also true.  Because three and seven don't share any common factors other than one that's the only contact they they definitely don't have any factors other than one in themselves. So this last name of must be sure these two options are related to limit one. If you look at the definition of Lima one and says that the greatest common divisor of two numbers divided by their greatest. I'm working as soon as we're not going to we're not going to demonstrate this but to instantiate this claim for this example would be saying that 9/3, 21 / 3. If we take the greatest common divisor of those numbers that people for one and that if we start reducing it is three 7  any ideas we / the biggest factor that they shared so the only factor that they can share now is 1  so this is important because it's just let us talk about numbers and he's reduced terms where we know that there's no other multiples floating around which helps us when we're talkin 4 square root of 2.  Flash greatest greatest common divisor and then we can set up then we can use some information about that later on in this proof to do is assume the negation of the property we want so we're going to assume that there exists such that I can't possibly be the case. So we're going to assume that the first step that's important here is that we're going to take Kaiser / the greatest common divisor come up with these two values.  Will that we know have a greatest common divisor this one?  I'm so \u221a 2 is going to be equal to this number A + B + B don't share any factors?  So, let's see where we can get from here. I haven't picked I haven't told you what are is going to be yet, and we haven't talked about what are is going to be square root of 2 is equal to A over B has a squared B squared.  A squared over B squared, which means so this is just by squaring.  both signs  But sometimes in a proof by contradiction, one of the things that I end up doing is a playlist that I have a little bit and that help me decide on what an interesting result for our might be manipulating the equation a little bit more interesting. We're all find something related to some property that I can prove and disprove this tells us it is equal to 8 just reorganizing  That's kind of interesting this tells us that a squared must be even.  cuz equal to 2 times something that's the definition of even from earlier by the definition of even and then we have this other so they must be even  I want a 303 is the one that says X is even if and only if x squared is even  You can look at this by looking at the way. I add numbers and powers of to work. But the this is true. If a number squared is even then the number itself is even  so that's interesting. So a must be even by Lema 3, but that means that equals 2 * k for some k  by the definition  of even  we haven't even number. It's definitely equal to 2 times some other integer interesting fact.  cry  Interesting this equation that means that two times B squared is equal to 2 K squared substituting into the equation.  pray  So to be squared is equal to 4 K squared. So B squared is equal to 2 K squared.  That's just reorganizing.  Cool, some P Squared is even too awesome.  B squared is even  that's just by the definition.  even so again B is even  that's Lema 3 again.  Call to A & B are both even that's an interesting discovery about this right cool. If we just start with this assumption, we can drive these two interesting facts as to really interesting facts here one is that is even so able to kxl meetcircle this one cuz that's actually the most most interesting way to talk about these two properties.  Thanks. So this is kind of funny because if a and b are both even  That means they both have 2 as a factor.  Want me to find a and b we said that we already found their greatest common divisor.  And so their greatest common divisor is one we weren't divided p&q by the greatest common divisor. We said up here.  the greatest common divisor of A and B is 1  Now we've shown that A and B are both even which seems to suggest that they have a greatest common divisor the not one.  but seems like a good way to start thinking about a definition for our  we found this inconsistency. Now, let's try and make it precise. What's a good choice for the definition of are so that we can get from here may be using the lemons that we have to both our and not our what's a good choice for our so that we can take this aggregation of evidence and demonstrate both R&R.  Talk about this for the rest of this falls into place.  Okay, suggestions suggestions. It is going to give myself the two minutes to put up a good definition for it.  baby is even so one suggestion for our is B is  even though we want to prove that he is even and  he is not even so because even I see the evidence for B must be even right here.  So here is the justification.  4B is even how would I prove that b is not even?  Daiso just splitting us of the first thing. You said I heard you say one is even and that's pretty clearly here. We have that justified.  What else what are the evidence we need to conclude that b is not even.  Yeah.  interesting, so let me to says  if gcd of a b equals one then both  are not even  Sorry, I love you. Be more precise.  then  only one of a  UC San Diego podcast "
