    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started.  I'm so happy Monday everybody.  Glad y'all made it here in the rain. I was annoying. So I want to continue talking about something interesting that happens here because on Friday the thing we really talked about is that we can write these functions to map Between Difference after to pair element between different sets. And he's like one to one onto functions are bijection functions that we can take the output and get back to the input throw function so we can actually just like right out code to test and verify some of these assertions were making certain part of this Fletcher and we can Implement in Java and run it and see what some of the answers are and I like it because it gives  Concrete sort of visceral sense that when we talked about having a function is one to one or onto and then we get a demonstration to program. What we're doing makes sense and actually is doing what we expected for this past week and see what the code looks like for it to the definitions. We were working with on Friday. And we did a lot of the sets that were fine with more straightforward to talk about these functions for the SATs properties we talked about one was that the cardinality of a is less is no bigger than the cardinality of this idea.  We can define a one-to-one function from a to be there was this idea of the cardinality of a is larger than or equal to the cardinality of be this idea of an onto function. There is something in the domain for each element for the range and then this idea that two sets have the same cardinality cardinalities and she is just sort of the top two properties together is on Tunis and this part that talks about all of the other a Prime's is the one to one that's so we can we can talk about it as both of the one to one and onto this being true. But this is also wait to talk about it all in one statement this idea that a single function is both one-to-one and onto  And then we have this theorem at the end this are my kids and interesting proof. If you look it up, we're not going to do it in class. We're going to assume that this is true. But there's this interesting theorem if we can show even with potentially different functions that is no bigger than B&B is no bigger than both of these have an existential in front. So proving these two different directions could use two different functions. They don't have to use the same function actions, or we can prove both of these directions. Then we get the sizes of the two sets are equal or the cardinality of the two sets are equal.  It's only use this theorem to talk about sizes of SATs, but often it's it's really interesting to think about this case.  Where there's just one function that makes this entire bijection and where we map from every element of the domain. Every element to the codomain one to one and onto that's actually really interesting case to look at and we'll see some examples of that today. It makes these things are kind of like you'd expect numbers to act less than or equal to in greater than or equal to how to act.  Then we can put we can talk about this proof of this proof is sort of long and indirect and so we're going to just work at a Sumit for for our purposes here.  And so we  We talked about this idea on Friday of comparing the set of natural numbers to the set of positive reals, and we identify there was this number 0 it was in.  The set of natural oils and zero is not in the positive reals.  And there's also obviously lots of real positive numbers that are not natural. So neither of these is a subset of the other but we can interesting we ask the question about the relationship between larger than the other based on the definitions we had so far. So, what do you think of setting up for working through some techniques today and some payoff it'll happen on Wednesday. I want to get your ideas about what you think is true here.  5 4 3 2 1 and talk about this further Avenues to pursue interesting set of properties.  Okay, feel free to Quicken again. I want to see I want to see a little bit about how things change but I'm only going to leave this open for a few seconds here. I just want a second opinion.  5 4 3 2 1  Alright, what why you picked a certain answer this with multiple answers represented here any thoughts here and then you discuss this interesting.  Yeah.  Interesting interesting. So you're relating the set subtraction and minus are definitely all natural numbers 1100 in that set natural store + 8.1 + 22 + 3 + Pi + stuff like that. And then we have all of these negative numbers including the negative integers, which is an interesting thing to talk about the traction. That's a really cool idea that people talked about when they were thinking about this relationship.  Appalachian show  there were a bunch of people who said  see, which is  a good answer it again. I want to be clear that a is not true. We said that and is not a subset of our plus cuz there's an element its in N that is not in our plus so as not true.  It would be interesting to talk about D&E and what we're going to be discussing today is how to deal with these cases or we have sets that are subsets of one another and maybe infinite and we still want to talk about their sizes.  And it turns out we can we can tend to do this direction of this question with what we learned from Friday from Friday. We can actually do use right now. I want to do some other stuff when you come back to this idea because doing it with the integers is going to be provide some nice examples from Friday if we get a little practice with this idea so season accurate answer but be like depending on how you define how much we learned on Friday.  okay, so let's talk about one example of this and I just want to give an example of doing this for some sets and walking through what it means to have a justification for this and then  then we'll be able to do it on a few more things here that question is is the is the size or the cardinality of the positive integer is equal to the cardinality of the negative integers know intuitively or maybe I was a pens depends who's intuition you're using too many negative integers is positive integers. They both go in the positive and negative Direction infinitely seems like that's the same we couldn't show up on send that one to one from the from Z + 2 Z - a function is one function exists. That is a third property that's listed at the top of your sheets property where we put them together and show to buy Direction.  And so the property at the top of the sheet just to get it on the side so we can talk about what we're trying to show is that there exists some function from and in this case were talking about as the Plus.  2 Z - sum function to take positive integers and produces negative integers. I'm just filling in for the eighth of a Aerobie that's in that third property on your sheet then for all be that are in and we have to be careful with that we're talking about what should the domain be here? What should I be writing is the set B is drawn from a basement property leasing.  So we're looking in this definition elements that were talking about 4B the domain. Which year is he -  okay. So the next thing we're saying is there must be some in the domain. That's the Plus.  and it must be the case that the function we choose applied to a is equal to be so that means we're going to different a but we had better be able to find an area that produces that be at the first part of this and then the other part of this is and  For all other Azo for all a Prime's in the domain.  And our domain is the Plus.  then if it's not equal to a then  it's not equal to this element.  This is saying we're going to look at every single negative number. That's the for all be and for every single negative number. We better be able to find a positive number that maps to this negative number based on the function if we choose and if we look at all of the other positive numbers, none of them also produce the same negative number they all produce some distinct negative number from the one we get for this date we chose  Footsie with this looks like if we try and push it through. The first thing we need is we need to find a witness for f which means we need to write. This is a this is saying there exists a function. So we need to talk about a function that will have the properties we talked about in the body here. What's a function that would work here? What function can we Define here? That would satisfy these properties?  Okay ideas ideas ideas. What's the function we could use here function we could use.  Maybe * -1 Sol to be just to make sure we feel this inappropriately. Let's be clear that we chose. The domain is e plus the codomain is he - and you said one idea is to say f of x equals negative 1 times x  Choosing out of the witness. So we have to show this large for all that starts with for all be in Z minus.  So  that means we'll be doing a proof by Universal General generalization.  I rather just say let be being arbitrary element of Z - o b is some negative integer.  He has some negative integer.  And what we have to show is that there exists some a in the positive integers that end up working for this whole property. So we do the antenna location and now we're trying to talk about this whole thing as the current to show.  And what age should we choose here? What should we choose for a we need a witness for a  Which we choose.  chose  -8  so we can choose a witness where a is equal to negative B.  And then we have to show that the body of this is true. So there's two parts to show we have to show that half of a equals B, and we have to show this other for all statement.  Those are the two the two goals here because we have to prove both of these things.  This part is pretty clear. We can substitute in f of negative B equals B, and then by definition of  f we get B negative 1 times negative B equals B, and this has pretty clear.  And now there's this other claim that we need to to show which is that if we pick something that's not equal to this and we've chosen as our witness. Then we get this implication making a little bit of space here. So Shear there's a couple steps so first  and it turns out in in these proofs with one to one and onto the domains are often the most important thing to pick it's like really useful to make sure that we get the domain correct. So here we know that like a is a positive number for example, and many of these cases is going to be important to know whether a number is a natural or an integer things like that are a prime is an arbitrary element has a plus and we know that just from the domain we gave on the Frog and so we're trying to show that the witness we chose then we can justify this FFA Prime not equal to be  So we have an application. Let's do direct proof.  Training the same order.  So now we know that a prime and some number.  And so we have a photo of a prime and we're trying to show that this is not equal not equal to be.  interesting  Hi.  So what do we know about these numbers? So F of a prime interesting we know about these?  so we know we defined a equals negative B as the witness, so he must be equal to negative a  And you're saying let's have a look at this this substitution. And so  here we can substitute Vehicles negative off of a prime equals.  -18 substituting in for B without idea  and a half of a prime is -1 *  a prime  you're saying that's equal to negative a  and here were saying a prime equals negative. This is a weird conclusion to get to the book carefully because I just wrote a bunch of stuff really quickly. I made to sort of intentional mistakes in both where I copied and substituted and then through these steps right? So I want you to catch  Cyro Depot's instead of Naughty Boy becomes really confusing later right when I went from this step to this step. I wrote equals instead of naughty. You should all be naughty. What does not equal statement.  I interesting I / this on this side but didn't divide on this side. I'm not equals a interesting. So what happened with this all as a sequence of just like algebraic rewrite 3. I just used over and over again. I would like some of these steps so it's not just like Larry Wright algebra till I get something that I think is true. I want to be clear about what happened this  Was it to show right this FFA Prime not equal to be with something that I had to show it was the body of the it was a conclusion of this implications after we did direct proof this stuff over here.  Some interesting evidence that we had from the Assumption. We made any assumption being the witness in the way. We set up all these different variables. Right? We knew that we had to find a is not equal to negative be so we can do a little bit of algebra and generate this show is really rewriting our to show into other logically equivalent expressions other logically equivalent in this equality.  Until we've Rewritten are to show into something that exactly matches an assumption. So we know that this statement is true because again will directly match this assumption and so we get to finish here and say this is true by assumption and that's how we know we're done because we assume that a is not equal to a prime when we did direct proof.  So I want to be clear about when I write a qualities. I want you to be clear in fruits to when you write a quality of to show all of this chain of logic with the things we were trying to show and that's where all that information came from.  This is what it looks like to just take this property to find an S. And then push it all the way through. This is what these days by Jackson Property looks like and this tells us that we're actually going to have this successful one to one and onto mapping from the positive integers to the negative integers and also that we have is direct one-to-one mapping.  I'm three questions about this proof before going on to more interesting things. I want to talk about before we go on.  Steps we took care.  4 facts about another interesting function  What's the last step to the yeah, so this evidence is substituted here basically, so I might write that as if I was writing in that two columns values on homework 5 on my right and the right hand side and we know that we can justify this and I might even like this really is about this part is the properties of the witness.  So let's talk about this other interesting function and this up a little bit so that we can see the function on its own.  So yeah, I want to talk about this function. I want you to both think about the domain and codomain of this function with a domain and codomain must be and also what is useful as a as a witness for so you can think about these blanks along with thinking about this question. But this question is is pretty interesting in both parks to think about so think about this domain and codomain and also an answer for if you can pick a code own domain and codomain it works for one of these are for all of these as you think about it, fill it in together.  5 4 3 2 1 domain and codomain for this function based on some of the options and some of the choices we have available domain and codomain for the function.  But we should fill in up top for the blanks.  Or an infant or interesting example of a domain and codomain that will not work. That would not be reasonable to choose for this.  Minico two-minute would not be good to choose here.  Yeah.  The first one won't be able to represent zero. So that's interesting you're saying in in a if we chose this function you we that we meet up this sort of weird that 0 is talked about in the function, but not an element of either of those sets.  The right hand side. There's like a 5th Grader.  If we had its I don't want to say it's not well-defined because if you know, it has a definition for all the positive integers. So if we rode Z plus we would get an answer for everything in that domain but it's awfully weird that it talks about numbers that are negative. If we chose plus as the domain that seems odd find Somehow Here good example examples already here.  This says nothing about non integer number which is kind of interesting. We might want to choose rational numbers are reals here and it could be well Define for rationals and reels on but we're not talking about those which is kind of interesting.  one thing I want to point out here is that  the all of these at all of the complaints were brought up especially about the negative numbers and you also mentioned about 0z plus here. They don't make this function is just as weird extra cases of what to do when it's zero in a camp what to do when it's negative and it can't be so weak. We couldn't use that without soda breaking the definition. It just might not be that might not be very useful and what other comments about this is the range of this right or the codomain of this since we would never use this case. This case would never be used if we picked me plus here then the code multiplying he's positive numbers by 2.  So it's going to be interesting to try and use this to talk about what really works to talk about because we couldn't choose so he's not really going to work here and it wouldn't make sense to choose those two elements for the domain and codomain here. We we wouldn't be able to talk about representing those all those numbers we talked about the plus a little bit and this problem with zero. He's not really going to work out here cuz we're never going to be able to produce a 0 if we start with Z plessis. The inputs see is actually pretty interesting to think about it seems pretty interesting to think about here. If the domain here is the integers and the codomain is the natural numbers.  that's kind of interesting to think about and it's worth just like looking at what some of those inputs and outputs look like so  we can think about the we call the X which is the input.  And then we can think about the output that's produced from the function.  0 and some positive numbers  and for -3 what do we get? Well, it's less than zero. So for negative three were in this case. So we get negative 2 times negative 3 gives a 6 and this produces 5.  In negative negative two times two is four. So this gives us three. This gives us one this gives a zero.  Now we're in positive numbers. We just * 2246 and we start to see something kind of interesting happening here. All of the all of the negative integers are being assigned to odd natural numbers and all of the positive integer. All the positive integers are being even natural numbers coverage, right? We have zero. We have one week 3 week 4 with 5 Wing 6, it seems like we're not missing any natural numbers and we have an outfit for every one of the integers.  Interesting. So yeah, is this a action or we done and we found like if we grab that property that third property there exists an F such that the rest of this is true.  This function we can push through I'm not going to think I want to do the proof in detail for this because of some other stuff. I want to talk about today, but we can do the same property and push through the proof for that property for this function. They were in fact going to get a different number output for every input integer and every single is going to be represented by some input.  So yeah, I'm trying to say that the set of integers by this definition has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.  By this definition we could argue about it. This definition of cardinality is any good because it leads to results like this.  Leave the saying that the size of the set of integers of the cardinality of the set of integers is the same as the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, but this is actually a decent definition of directly between these sets is a pretty good definition of size and it leads us to this conclusion, which is kind of interesting kind of interesting.  So this is true, we could push through this property. I might come back and talk about this later, but I don't want to go through this whole proof right now. So is Mother interesting properties to talk about today? Like really?  Talk about this idea for a minute. Are you comfortable with this idea that the size of all the integers including negative numbers is the same as the size of all the natural numbers is this bad talked about that for a minute.  Any questions or comments about that questions or comments about that before moving on like Snot.  Interesting, is it because they're open both infinite stats to the properties get screwy in this way this way. Yes by this definition in particular this definition of one to one onto and bijection if we write down that this is what we mean by equals that we can do this mapping buy a function then this is the consequence so you can always take an input in Napa to an output and vice-versa. It's a useful way to talk about having a mapping between two sets. It is a little eye to me. It's a little weird. There's so many more managers clearly. There's all the negative ones right? But if we pick this definition Hazard definition of equal  We just have to work in a world where this is a consequence of that the consequence of a definition and we have to develop our own use of these definitions and intuition about these deal with other properties that are going to result and you will have to believe me and then sort of see through doing talking about more of these properties definition.  So  I'm going so there's an interesting couple of things we can do with properties of cardinality where we can talk about this fear on the tells us if we prove the greater than equal than less-than equals onto stats. We can conclude the equality but there's some other properties and their unsurprising properties that are similar to mathematical properties. So which one of these which ones of these three a D&C do you think are true based on knowing that we serve show these things up top already?  and the interesting for you to think about  I'm asking you to assume this for this question. This positive numbers is same cardinality is the set of natural numbers answer. But which of these are true if we assume that?  five four  3 2  1  okay.  So first of all, before we go on anyone have an answer for how to show that the positive number one county is the same cardinality of the natural numbers.  What about a function that we could use to demonstrate that if we didn't demonstrate it on the slides?  yasso  this is a function from  z+ to the naturals and so 1 Maps 202 maps to one and so on and that gives us the same kind of bijection. So clearly we can always find an element and Z Plus that would correspond to a natural number and we get different natural numbers for every element of Z. + so that's another sort of simple mapping that works for this case.  And I'm so I want to talk about why some of these properties are true. And we know that this is that we can demonstrate this one. But which of these are true and it turns out some some properties that we care about are true about cardinality. So all of these are true all of the above C answer here. And the reason is we have these these realities that A and B are the same then the then the cardinality is Abby and I are the same and we have this property looks like transitivity where if a is equal to 8 has the same cardinality is Cindy has the same cardinality of see the Nancy have the same cardinality.  And then this identity like property that has that has the same cardinality is itself. So these are we're going to assume these we might do some work with them in the homework where you talk about demonstrating but ideas Faith are similar to property and we can use them to get from those assumptions to use these different ones to show that likes NZ place has the same as the same as Z Z Plus must be the same as easy for example, and so we can get lots of the properties of amethyst.  I'm pulling up using these once we demonstrated something for a pair of set sometimes we'll just use these properties to get two demonstrations for other sets instead of building up a whole new function.  Two particular examples of constructions. I want to talk about that are more interesting than just going from one set of numbers to another set of numbers caring which is this idea that we could write functions map from pairs of integers two integers or from integers two pairs of integers. So let's think about positive integers for now and let's think about what we're going to do this function from the positive positive integers and then a one-to-one function from pairs of positive integers two positive integers, so doing both directions, and this will be enough to show the equality by that offer steam room.  So how about this direction? We want to write an F that takes an ax and produces some hair and its type is that X is going to be a positive integer, and the result is going to be this ordered pair.  And sometimes One Direction of these constructions is like really want to make sure I have yeah.  triple x, x  and keep in mind I'm using one to one this year not the full bijection to all I need to demonstrate is that there's a different pair for every input number. I don't have to say that every possible ordered pair is covered. I just have to say you're different if the input is different compared out here because the pair is always is going to be based on that number 0 x also works for example anything that's just a distinct apparel for every possible in the other direction is the direction that is  A little more complicated to justify. So we want to write a function whose input is ordered pairs.  So I'm just writing this with the double set of parentheses to be really specific that what I mean is this ordered pair of X and Y where they're both positive integer, and we need to invent that as a single number and justify that we won't ever get the same number for two different pairs examples of things that will not work here x + y doesn't work because if we talked about the pear 1 0 and 0 1 they would produce the same output.  And so it wouldn't be a one-to-one function why can't work also can't work because anything all of these things that have a zero in one position all produce the Euro as their number so x times y can't work. So there's a bunch of things that don't work.  Thank you. All right now let's pick a better a better reason this won't work. Thank you.  Thanks. So here is better reasons. This won't work still are reasons. It won't work. But thank you I should get the domain right knee examples. Thanks. So what what are kinds of things we could try to make this work?  It turns out one thing that works here is if we pick some different prime numbers.  And use them as bases and use X and Y as exponents.  Print out this work word for interesting reason what happens here is we can think of any ordered pair. There's lots of exit maybe a really big number for acts really big number for why and this results in a number like two times two..... * 2 * 2  x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3  and since these are prime we know this number only has and based on some of the things we learned about factoring numbers into Prime's since all of these factors twos and threes are Prime's is the only way to really big number because if we can find some other multiple breaks that idea that each number only has one unique way to factored into Prime's because doing so this ends up giving us distinct integers for every ordered pair and we can run you to write this program. So I just want to show you what that looks like. So this program is called according to a file called ordered and if you do this out, you can just run and get the numbers for all the repairs and you could run this Loop for as long as you want and for as many as you needed to convince yourself that this is going to work.  Powerball numbers we can get some intuition just by looking at this like 411 when you get 6 out cuz we got to x 3 and we can see it grow and not repeat any of these small numbers and as we keep adding to this ordered pair is this going to become a bigger and bigger number is Thanksgiving.  The visible condition is pretty simple. It's just a function that has like the power the power helper function on both of these things and we could run this forever and we would never get two of the same manager printing invitations.  What is one other case that I want to discuss which is doing the same thing, but for our link, which is really interesting Prospect to think about or asking is the set of natural numbers the same cardinality as the set of are linked lists.  What?  I can we come up with a way. So this direction I claim is going to be pretty straightforward. Again, we can say that I have axes ax empty list kind of similar to what we did with the ordered pairs definitely get a different list for every number. That's a one-to-one function here. But what the heck do we do in this second case when we need to go from a list to a single number and make sure that number is distinct across all lists, and we need a different number for every different list we put in  What the heck? Is that going to look like?  We know a little bit about the shape of it we can get started by saying all right, it's a function. It takes list and produces natural numbers natural numbers. And so it's going to have these two cases of the basis step.  And the recursive step.  Such a pretty good start, right? It was a lot that we get from the structure of it being a linked list.  Now we're going to the Natural. So we do have 0 available sound like my my broken examples on the last one that I had to change here. We can actually use Euro we have zero available zero is nice to to pick in the basis that we can work with that.  And say so what are we doing this other case? So again, there's some things that won't work. We won't be able to do like n + f of L because again we could just have the same numbers between the different order and we get the same some so that kind of thing won't work product won't work either, but we can actually reuse the idea from the last line.  and say  We get to the end. So we'll use this number with this Prime 2.  Is this other prime number 3. What do you think we should use for the exponent? What might work for the exponent?  What's the exponent?  I work I work.  Can we get some number that we could use as a good exponent there?  three functions around that take listen produced numbers  Oh, yeah, so we could use f applied to the rest of the list as an exponent here.  no by the same argument as the last slide this number is always going to turn into some number of 2 is multiplied together and then  UC San Diego podcast "
