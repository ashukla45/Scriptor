So I don't our text message through General has not grab the iPad. I don't know where Laura is. I was calling her Melissa. Maybe she's mad at me, but it's Laura.  The iPad doesn't seem to be working anyways, so I may have to just do it straight by phone. It's been very feisty lately. It's not the behaving normally so I'm going to do it by phone. So they'll be no text message and don't even go there but it will be it's a little bit of a mess because the numbers all come into by user as opposed to in order, but we'll figure it out. Okay, we were talking about open the stuff. We don't even have it since I came early and it's just a big mess.  You guys could have kept on hanging in rapping. Let's see what happens.  This is a good sign something's happening.  This is always think the professor's nightmare the student stream, but the professor's nightmare. Okay. So here we go.  And I don't even have a picture of the iPad isn't working. So I'm going to try to do it myself there Laura a text message.  Yay.  Hey, can you turn up the mic? I just did.  I'll try again and you're just like me listen closely.  Cuz I noticed there's a lot of wrestling in Revelation. You're all excited because it's Tuesday.  It's almost the weekend. Alright, so  okay, so we were talking about some aspects of metabolism. I want to finish that up and then we're going to actually have two lectures worth of carbohydrates incredibly interesting topic villain or vinyl or so before that. Remember we were talking about discussion section and we're trying a bold experiment in discussion section. I made you all raise your right hand and promised you would look at those young egg study and if you looked at it  I'm supposed least 10 of your dad. Now if you looked at at school little cynical, right cuz you raise your hand you will notice is pretty complex. Like it's a pretty simple punch on eggs might be bad but it's a pretty complex study and I would even say that it's complex to the point where Anon epidemiologist might have a lot of trouble reading it and really extracted. So we're going to do something a little different one of these incredibly important things that will impact directly on you, especially if you're a health professional but even just as a person living in this information, which society is people do said he's like that and then there's all these other levels of report it there's review articles. There's Pier indication, there's lectures. There's also newspaper articles. There's internet post Twitter feeds and all of that is different levels of information about Windows podcast. Some of them are great some of them. So we're going to explore study came out.  Don't hit women study came out. I saw two people hitting. So when is starting came out there was a lot of noise about it because the eggs the problem with eggs comes and goes it's bad. They're good. They're bad. So I thought it'd be fun to look a little at that. So what you have to read actually read in this might be worth as alien to you. So I'll spell it but you have to read I know it's not a lien what you up to read? Is this Eklund Camp article on the Shang eggs. This is a much lighter fare. This is like eggs without the yolk. So I knew I was even showed you was I no, like when you hear that you have to read something. It's like a foot.  Can't we scared him? So I'm going to show it to you. I even I grabbed a version of it. Here it is. It's like one of these internet PDS big fat tax only a few pages for what's very cool about it is actually it's it's a pretty neat article because this journalist is one of these Wellness during what does a web page website interview the number of cardiologist and food scientist to see what they thought about this Yang Zhang egg study and what day what what how to think about it until this and really interesting. So what year did discussion sex with your quiz scussion is going to be about is this article trying to find a little bit about the Zhong X that is so you guys are going to discuss what this article says. What makes sense why it might be a little bump the bass take what you got from it. So here's the thing. If you don't read it, you're putting the burden on your Discussion Group Bros and sis has  You got to bring it for your brothers and sisters in the discussion group. Okay, that's why you have to read it. You want to pull your weight and be part of a community also to make the discussion more interesting, but it's also cool because if you go through this nutrition class your friends will go what's the deal with things to do with trans-fats what to do with fructose. They're going to they're going to ask you all of that, you know, and and the more you learn the more people will ask you and so this is a good way to start the purses. I promise you people are all your nutrition. Should I be eating eggs? And you go wrong eggs study, you might think there's some risk. However, it's important to put it into contextual view. So this is why you're going to do this. I think you'll like it. I think it's actually pretty relevant print in Jersey and I realize that we have to actually write Zhong an e-mail and ask Zhang.  Cuz John's the first author and usually they're the most directly involve the study some questions about how they collecting the data cuz they is a Cas and I sat around and could not figure out some aspects of how the day was brushing with the primary paper. That's what we do for you. We want to help we save God. I really don't know. We went deep into the supplement section. So it'll be interesting maybe some of you can help us out. We're in the middle of a bold experiment that seems to be failing mildly, but I'm going to ignore me put my phone on.  Safe with you guys so many of them put my phone on non auto lock.  Display and brightness do not lock you can get Siri to do this this right? Hey Siri open auto lock.  Hey Siri, open auto lock.  Take a look at the orchard lock setting have to tell me I just open it whenever I have a South African guy as my Siri. It's just as  When's the rest of them but okay, so we're doing it, okay?  This is not the quicker. I don't even want to Russell Ranch clicker. No, this is just a reminder of a thing is  I want to make sure you know, the mammals can't make glucose from fatty acids. You can't do it. You can get a little bit of label in through the Krebs cycle. But anytime you make glucose you need a starting molecule of bigger three carbons are bigger and fatty acids give you a starting molecule of two carbons. That is a c Delco AC it just won't work and the difference between glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids with a glucogenic ones are metabolized is something that has more than two carbons like a like a Krebs cycle intermediate or pyruvate or something like that. I need ketogenic ones are metabolized to acetylcholine and we have this you say I noticed on that graph you showed over that picture. You showed a few days ago.  That there's some amino acids that are ketogenic and glucogenic. That's because they have more than one catabolic pathway. One of them gives you a molecule bigger than two 3-carbon bigger than two carbons everything glucogenic one and the other pathway gives you a c look away. So that's ketogenic. Okay, we good with that and I'm hoping you'll learn that it 102 but if you do now is a perfectly good time to learn it, since there's no bed time like the present. Okay, I will talk more about this in this is basically this is one with I thought of like 20 ways to try to teach a lesson. It's always difficult. I don't really know why but it is but this is one way to view that you can't take a seat of clay carbon and converted into glucose carbon every single osito claim that enters the Krebs cycle to CO2 is are released. So there's no net flow of carbon into bigger molecules like glucose. Okay, so that's maybe a comforter.  One way to look at that. Okay, you can just believe it. But if you want to convince yourself, you might have to look at the at the pathways then we will talk more about this when we talk about ketosis and starvation and the keep ketonic diet all very interesting and they ketogenic diet. They're all related to this fact this fact, they're all related to okay. So here's some imperatives in metabolism cuz we're talking about metabolism in and you know, we're trying to think specifically about how much tablets are related to nutrition and whole body stores of molecules in energy metabolism is number one. It's critical to maintaining ATP production in this is where we stopped by somebody and it is absolutely critical mammals are in the business of maintaining blood glucose of 5 millimolar around 5 millimolar 70 80 mg per deciliter for some reason as the measure for blood.  If you buy a blood glucose meter, I have one just for fun. It's kind of fun. You know, you can get them at the drugstore. They're kind of cheap nerdy fun measured in milligrams per deciliter, even though it's just such a weird concentration. So that's what you'll see a normal blood glucose is between 70 and like 95 or 100 mg per deciliter turns out that your metabolism your organs. Your body will go to Great Lengths to keep glucose at those levels too high is not a big problem acutely. It's a big problem chronically to low is a big problem acutely acute means in the moment right away. If your blood glucose drops below 70, you will definitely feel it. If it drops below 50 milligrams per deciliter, you might go into a coma so it's really important that blood glucose is always kept the same.  So another imperative metabolism is sources of energy that vary with time. So we preferentially use carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are a great great energy source, and we will preferentially use them if they're available.  And then then we use fatty acids amino acid soap in the absorptive phase like right after we eat and that's called postprandial. Let's set up a terms Corral here.  I'm so we have Fran deal.  I'm Randy all that. This is Brandi off. So Brandy let's actually you know what? I should always use capital letters. That's the first my little erasers are gone. Holy crap.  I've had them here for months who took my erasers by some desperate assistant professor.  That's crazy. What would anyone needs them for? Like how should I be looking everywhere for one of these? Why would anyone need a small eraser except he had gathered a hell of a lot of water bottles down here. Wow. I mean I bought them to give I'm a giver. I'm like the liver. I'm a giver and  Matthew's is big thing. That makes me look tiny. I look like an l.  Jesus or anyway prandial  maybe someone will listen to the podcast in Gilded Lily bring back a little Appalachians school teacher erases. I don't know but after eating okay and so in the absorptive phase if you are is after glucose is the primary source of energy. It's in the blood were using it and then we are calm down and use fatty acids to I'm in also as we may have learned in 108. There's very definite different usages of fuels depending on her activity level when were when were sedentary or or or working at a very low level of activity. We tend to use fatty acids. And as our intensity bear activity goes up will use more glucose. That's a whole other thing not eating in a we're gifted because we have a gastrointestinal system that delivers food gradually in the body and we have storage mechanisms. We don't have to eat all the time. We don't have to constantly for it.  We cannot do other things like build cultures and teach classes. And so there's this arm going isolation between insulin and glucagon and as you know insulin is the hormone of plenty of sweats release to say it's time to store food we have food is postprandial. Okay and glucagon is the hormone that gets released for this is crazy. It's a hormone that gets released when store start dropping we need to start mobilizing thing. So it's really that we should look fine as a hormone of impending catabolism and insulin is a hormone and intending Annapolis would be one way to view and see you got these oscillations after me. I was after a meal glucagon goes down. That's blue and Insulin red goes up, you know, cuz it's it's signaled by the pancreas and it's actually interplay of two kinds of cells called the beta cells the beta cells of the pancreas and alpha cells of the pancreas and this I think you covered in 102 we certainly covered it.  Now, you know the pancreas has his whole other life as a secretory organ and produces bicarbonate a few other enzymes. It's incredibly important in that role and but the small islet cells of the pancreas are incredibly important for controlling the tablet was just kind of cool. The pancreas is getting the new helping mobilize and get the food into the body and then using in been releasing hormones that control how we employee or deploy those molecules. So the pancreas the islet cells involved beta cells and alpha cells in close proximity any insulin that gets released from the beta cells actually controls their glucagon released for the alpha. So so they're they're pushing and pulling all the way at the cellular level, okay.  all red so sexy like I drew this those are blood vessels you mean this these things  are those are the somatostatin producing cells it probably we're not going to talk about their red so that the debate debate has to hear the beta cells and the alpha cells are light blue in these red ones are by the somatostatin producing cells that we don't talk about as much in and I'm guessing though. So what happens is after a meal you get a spike of insulin that relates to the spike of glucose. You see the insulin is is tuned to the blood glucose levels in his blood glucose levels go up in Sims released and then as the blood glucose is is is brought down through the action of insulin. The insulin goes away too and to get these constant oscillations and glucagon goes the other way and one interesting calculation you can make is you can compute how high your blood glucose glucose would go if you didn't have insulin working and it would go very high. So the damping that insolent  Depressive and it keeps things fairly low even after a big meal. Okay, then we will talk more about the aberrations of insulin regulation never met with diabetes and the effects that it has on metabolism as well as some of the dietary responses to diabetes and people are dietary dietary approaches to buy diabetes. Basically, I guess I think it's sort of you know, I'm semi familiar is insulin tends to lower blood glucose by increasing storage glucagon tends to raise blue Coast by decreasing storage and increasing production today in mnemonic device. I came up with the Mike Laster you Randy Hampton survivors will remember this is glucagon is produced when glucose is gone. Get it when glucose is gone. You give glucagon get it. That doesn't that's poetic. Does it mean to be gone?  This is a little description is insulin causes an increase in glucose uptake in a number in tissues are glycogen synthesis, which lowers blood glucose. So insolent NC increased blood glucose uptake or taking increase glucose storage in muscles and liver and so it tends to lower blood glucose. And that's why a diabetic will take a shot of insulin. Their blood glucose is high because it stimulates those processes glucose synthesis to raise blood glucose. This is not the first time you've heard this but if not, it's okay. Okay, I don't know why I have both of those. They're okay. So another aspect of insulin you're here as much about this because you know diabetes was discovered insulin was first really understood as a gluco regulatory hormones, but it actually insulin and glucagon both affect lipid mobile.  Station in lipid stores as well. Okay. I know this is very complex interplay between lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism and diseases like diabetes. So insolent not surprised. Hey, we just ate we got to take advantage of all these useful molecules insulin increases fat storage and glucagon decrease as fat storage and increases mobilization. So think about is glucagon is sort of like a slow-acting version of epinephrine they act in a very similar way it started. They're both go time hormone decreases lipolysis and decreases the activity of hormone sensitive lipase. So hormone sensitive lipase. Is it useful term hsl  wishes for my own  sensitive abbreviate that lipase and this is the this is a version of a lipase that hydrolyzes triglycerides to make Three fatty acids lower. The activity of an increase is fatty acids storage. Okay, where is glucagon increases lipolysis and hormone sensitive lipase meeting increases the release of fatty acids from stores and increases their production and availability of them, which is something you'd want to do is glucoses away now, so that sort of three aspects that I talked about him and I talked about the incredibly important role of vitamins and nutrients and controlling tons of metabolic pathways and it showed you that vast list of precursors to co-factors and all the factors like riboflavin it and f a d and f MN internet connection between the vitamins retake and a huge number of enzymes. It will only work if those vitamins are available that's one connection and the other is you know, this energy metabolism we're talking about is, you know store  Bring an interconverting metabolites that we consume in a like glucose can become fat and fat can be stored as triglycerides and metabolism is really important this very large collection of diseases that are either affect what we can eat or are abrogated by nutrition aspects and end the sort of simplest version of these are called inborn errors of metabolism. So inborn errors  This is like a standard term a term of art not arrows errors lb in the sociology department, so inborn errors of metabolism are examples of a single. Usually the ones that are best understood her a single enzyme that is deficient or not working correctly or absent that affects a particular metabolic pathway. I want you to step back a second. Think about the metabolic pathways Charter. I showed you, you know, it's that daunting chart with all those circles and and Pathways with arrows. It's important to remember that every single one of those arrows.  Is an enzyme it's encoded by a gene every single one of those arrows is under genetic control by a gene product being needed for that are out of work meaning every single one of those arrows is subject to the rules of genetics including the simple. Mehndi Mehndi leandro's are wrinkled peas. Smooth Pete all plants are plain and fancy Wheels in that kind of thing. So metabolism is subject to and nutrition accordingly are subject to all sorts of important features that are ruled by genetics. And so you might imagine if you had a metabolic pathway you were missing one of those arrows missing one of those enzymes to a mutation in a gene and encoded enzyme you might have an observable clinical syndrome and he's as a group are called inborn errors of metabolism amazingly enough. This was a one-time suddenly Realize by a fellow named Archibald garrod. He was a Scottish position.  We started realizing that many of the diseases he would see that it looks like they involved processing of nutrients in metabolic processes where describable by Mindy Lee inheritance. He was like the first person to really see that these things ran in families in ways, you could understand in the same way as been dealing genetics and the first is easy actually studied was one of a very mild symptoms called alkaptonuria. It involves a van intermediate and the metabolism of of aromatic amino acids are tense of build up in the urine. So it's very easy to see cuz the urine is really Darkly colored and has an odd scent and so it was actually very once he found people have had this it was not hard to study it to figure out was going on. So this is he was the first person in true that sort of you might think that that was kind of a like, why would you care about that at the patients are okay, but it led to some really deep thinking about the nature of metabolism and how genes control it. So this is actually a number of diseases that  Discover this is. This is the one that he he is best known for in this molecule homogentisic acid builds up and is a very noticeable by-product in the urine. It just gets in your animated out and there's a number of different. These are all them if you actually there's a big charts of inborn Errors of metabolism. There are thousands now diseases that have been noticed studied and in some cases alleviated by understanding that we're going to talk now about a much more clinically important disease called phenylketonuria. And this is a beautiful example of basic direct science leading to a really reasonable nutritional approach to a disease. So you probably all heard of phenylketonuria PKU PKU  Speak at your sounds like a university but it's not and what happened was in 1936. This guy I was born for letting you think he'd invented Haagen-Dazs with all those who know his name, but he was that he was Norwegian and his mother and father and and became to him and they had two children who were showing clear strong symptom ology. They were mentally very delayed. They were non-responsive and it was really tragic Vedra little children and he was able to discover that in their urine. There was a certain molecules present that it had certain qualities that didn't make sense and he discovered through it. It's actually incredible Straight Ahead organic chemistry. He discovered that the urine had an Entertainer that reacted iron and made this bright green color and he figured out it was a ketone and furthermore is a ketone with an aromatic residue in it. And he realize that what they had was a buildup of this molecule.  You will hear of phenylpyruvate now. I know you all know how to draw pyruvate cuz who doesn't know how to drop pyruvate. I mean everyone can relate to Cocoa to tell you remember it.  Cheer Coco. That's it. That's what I would too. If you had Erin Coleman, he didn't do to Cocoa with you to screw that but you can learn to hear your cocoa. That's how you remember it and fennel pyruvate looks like that's it has a girl group on it. And this is a direct what this is what this is my good people. This is the this is the alpha keto acid version of phenylalanine. And so I don't know how you pronounce and knowing the metabolism he figured out that what was missing what was created going crazy. What was missing was this enzyme called? Phenylalanine? Hydroxylase? Phenylalanine? Hydroxylase is used in the normal course of using felon Allen to make things and when it's missing the phenylalanine just builds up builds up.  Metabolic pathway Dee Dee emanated to this stuff which has toxic effects and also builds up in the urine and that's how he's able to detect it. And so this is sort of the comparison. This is actually incredibly quaint picture that I got out of a very old paper, but sort of you have a certain blood level of phenylalanine. Okay, and in normal cases, the phenylalanine is floating around the blood. It's used to make things. I tyrosine tyrosine is a precursor of a number of neurotransmitters. It's an important amino acids in proteins. And if you have a block of this phenylalanine, hydroxylase got to be phenylalanine builds up to level C. I don't know if you can see this by the normal levels are 123 mg per deciliter and in a PKU patient there 2264 Dexter their 2250 Times Higher in this is the levels of this are not good to have no way to deal with it and it turns out that all you have  To do for a Pita Pit paste with PKU want you to text it is is restrict their phenylalanine. Make sure to provide them with the tyrosine. They can't make any longer and they're fine. So this is why you receive PKU warnings. I mean, this is so for example, you might think we'll where is fennel only comes from all kinds of things. So you have to have protein limited or or protein control diets, but also this sweetener aspartame, which is the blue. Yeah. I know we all your sweetness is the pink ones the green ones if your hippie the yellow ones if you're a modernist and the blue ones if you like peptides and the blue one is equal and equal is is has this and that's why equals as ingredients dextrose with maltodextrin aspartame and you'll see this is aspartame which has a phenylalanine and so it's a rich source of phenylalanine and they actually warned people with PKU to avoid I taking my guess is you'd have to eat a lot of equal.  75 and Allen in the diet. And so this is actually kind of a striking photograph in the early days before they knew this there were no cases where a family had a patient who grew up at 2 in NH pass when the symptoms could be reversed before they knew about the dietary modification. So this isn't very unfortunate. You can call that an accidental controlled experiment in which this brother who is Xi was not treated that way cuz it was such a new therapy and he is severely mentally disabled his two-and-a-half-year-old sister was treated by by then. They knew and she was perfectly fine actually grew up into a normal adulthood. So there's a critical window in which you would you have to do the dietary manipulation with the amazingly complex diseases with all these long-term and even primitive symptoms simple modification of the diet literally makes the difference between cure and cause that's pretty cool new pretty important.  Now we're going to shift gears. Let me see their questions.  If you get your gallbladder removed what Nutritional Lifestyle might I have a friend who is missing a gallbladder. What's up friends about how much Liberty is there other ways to absorb lipids in the gallbladder helps and I think it varies with different people's dietary predilections. Let's see food, food, officially postprandial somnolence. I like that.  During the postabsorptive phase. Is there a ship to create fatty acids absorbed of you when you're storing them. And then what you do is as glucose level start dropping you start using fatty acids more. There's a hormonal regulation of the mobilization of fatty acids.  Okay. Are you going to post the study list? I did study list posted. I did it on Sunday. No.  I'm singing no hole.  This is worth a little hyperlink. Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to do this together with you. I watch won't be able to get the internet. Come on.  This would never happen in Harvard. Okay, come on. Okay. There we go.  Did I?  one through four  Okay, hold on.  I want to prove it. Prove it trying to add.  What's my name?  They just gave me a bunch of dots for a code. I don't know what that is. Okay, so, all right. All right. All right.  All right, electric slide. All right reading.  lecture slides  studylist interims  Okay, let's study list.  Check it out. Open it.  Make sure one lets you to lecture 3 lecture for so there.  Okay, but I do the same thing. I asked first and look later. I'm not kind of guy hold on but I'm going to do something else just to scare the person who texted me.  okay, so, okay, so  all right.  Where are we I'm surprised more people would match don't use that in lectures. It's like, you know, your friend is so pretty serious. People doesn't go over. Okay, so we're all good. We're good. Okay, here's the number of that person. I'm kidding. Okay, so we're going to talk about them in a Broadway. But it one of the questions that will definitely arise constantly is are they bad or are they good and I think it's sort of like saying is TV bad or is he totally depends on what you're watching and how much you watching what you're using for your is music bad or good music for seven. Absolutely Central role in our diet and our metabolism.  It's like it you probably see I've heard of all of these books. In fact, I went I read this book with a group of freshmen Verve freshman seminar was quite at this is a very famous book that came out in 1972 And this book actually underwent incredible very focused depression by the sugar industry and add this this author was debunked. He almost lost his post at the University was at where is it turns out they practically everything you said is accurate and he was really sort of a a Visionary about the importance of restricting the amount of pure sugar that we eat. So there is a dark side to 2, but the question is where do we stand as tomorrow's parents? Tomorrow's Physicians tomorrow's people who wanted, you know Explorer on Wellness. How do we do that? So we first have to get some times together. So we're going to talk about what these different sack rights are and again, I'm thinking this might be  Review, but there's in a collection of sugars that are called monosaccharides mono.  chat  Thai rides  and these are actually a collection of an MBA Dancy immersive exactly the same empirical formula C6 h-12 o-6 and they only very by the stereochemistry of where they o h is r on them so high fructose galactose and glucose and galactose three main ones and no you don't have to memorize the structures, you know, you don't even have to recognize the structure is in this case, but they I want you to notice two things. Number one. They are all very similar to have exactly the same formula number to they're all either aldehydes are ketones in this open form a number three, and I'm hoping that you learn this and when time it is cool, if you haven't we know where it is a form ring forms called anomers and if you don't know what an atom or is that was a good time to learn it an animal or you may be new to this but didn't know what the term was. It's those circles that they form the circle sofa for glucose Sprint and see this circle metaforms.  Circle is because this O H attacks this aldehyde group in Nick's a ring called a hemiacetal and that opens and closes all the time. If the ring goes one way, it's an alpha form. If it goes the other way. It's the beta for him. That's how that works. Okay, and that's why you can see Lennie or forms of the sugars or circular for him. And normally in solution are constantly oscillating between one form of the other is in equilibrium level like for the alpha and beta forms of glucose. I think it's like 6733 for one of the other ones slightly stable and the chemistry of them gets interesting when you start locking those forms into polymers are these are the three monosaccharides now, they're also disaccharide in these are the ones that we often consumed in their very delicious. So there's and I want you to just know the definite what these are like, you know, the glucose that sucrose is glucose + fructose. Okay, and that and that maltose is glucose glucose.  History, but I again we're not going to dwell on that. That's why I make a study list and it turns was so we don't have to spend a lot of class. I'm talking about what you have to know. You can just find out by looking at that list before you text me. No, it's okay. I don't mind I want to make sure I had it so these are three different disaccharides. This is maltose like a malted milk. This is a sucrose and this is galactose and glucose making lactose milk sugar and my wife is extremely intolerant of lactose. So we're going to talk about lactose intolerance a little later she acts like she at makes her the wild-type and I'm the mutants because I'm lactose intolerant as many people from the Western European climbs are due to the rise of Agriculture. Anyway, we'll talk about that all later. But I want you know, what these are now in sucrose is pretty  Really interesting cuz this is what we eat in great amounts hundreds of times as much as people did a hundred years ago and it breaks on almost instantly into fructose are fructose and glucose and the the degree to which the sugars are bad for us and the extent to which that's due to amount vs. Composition is a really really interesting question. So, you know those okay like this, I want you to notice something you see this Bond here to Define see that Bond here that I highlight a spotlight.  And this one here how weirdly. This one she's the heck of a sine wave. This is lazy carbohydrate chemistry. So carbohydrate always do this and they'll drop a bomb like it if you have glucose. I'm just going to drive that the Rings, okay.  Bear with me here. So this would be  Queso, the maltose is Alpha One for glucose glucose glucose and the correct way to draw that is like this cuz it's basically an LH and in a way to split water out and made an ether linkage all the carbohydrate chemistry like this. I'm going to erase this.  For some reason there's a convention in Charlotte like this know any self-respecting abbreviate saturated carbon with a Vertex, right? So you might think it's around X. So, is that a carbon or what? It's not it's just crappy crappy nomenklatura. Okay. I shouldn't podcast that there might be glycobiology the age of pugilism.  I can fire a few big champions in this class to help me out come out.  Okay, so so I just want to make it clear and so this is actually just next fight I grabbed is a much better to patient is this is Vic bonds are correct. This is what they really I mean are like in representation is a water spring split on you get basically what looks like an ether linkage. Okay. So this is the correct. So this is sucrose lactose and maltose and the reason I don't love these is cuz they made them upside down, you know, this this sugar is inverted so it so it has a nice shape to the bomb drawing a beta linkage is difficult. So but you get it you are those the only three dietary sugars and answers plant products and stuff in there and it's probably even wrong to call them phytochemicals because they're so abundant, you know, there's all sorts of sugar. So this is a very popular one called raffinose and raffinose.  Simplicity already tells us something interesting about the interplay between gut metabolism and human metabolism. So this actually is a little gallery of the different monosaccharide. So this is galactose alpha alpha one-six linked glucose, which is Alpha 1 4 links to fructose. Okay. Now this is sucrose we love that but when the girl actresses attached to it, there's a big problem is this stuff we can't metabolize that our cells do not know how they're not have what's called alpha-galactosidase enzyme alpha-galactosidase or alpha-gal now if a glycoside ace Cleaves of that particular galactose Pond and so what happens in this is actually common in a lot of different intolerance things like lactose intolerance is related to this. Also, if you ingest that it passes through the small intestine with all the enzymes and acidity and all that stuff doing  Thanks to no avail. It ends up in the large intestine. What you now know is the site of a hotbed of echo logical microbial activity, you know, their colon is where it's all happening in terms of Gino's number and those bacteria. I have a field day they go crazy and they start making lots of fermented products and gas and one of the intolerance features as you know, it has diarrhea and and and terrible stomach difficulty in lots of flatulence. So this is really a problem in the trouble with raffinose. Is it in lots of different? It's in beans it's in cabbage. It's ingrained into depending on the extent to which your microbes are and he sent to which you eat. It. It can be a problem. So amazingly there's another nutritional solution to this. This is a product called Dino. I guess it's been around forever. I've heard of it when I was a kid and and Binoo is actually a pretty sophisticated thing. It's it's a package edible Ensign. So be no is is supplying it.  Alpha-galactosidase that we don't normally what's that?  Honey is Sabino people stopped advertising?  You're making fun of a product that you can go buy in the supermarket and its supplies that missing enzyme so it before it gets the large colon and and and gastrointestinal disaster. You get cleavage of the galactose off which gets metabolized in the sucrose is also invertase in it which Cleaves a sucrose to but it's really the alpha galactosidase. It supplied by it's pretty amazing dietary solution to a fairly intricate microbial problem in time.  so  I have that old time going backwards. That's why.  Polymers in this is where it really gets interesting it in terms of carbohydrates. So because these are I mean I didn't link these but if you look at the structure, you know, here's this is glucose. Actually. This is alpha glucose like that and then down down. Do you want another another little nemonic? If you're not you're not on 102 Randy Hampton Auto Train survivors is you might think you need to have those anomer is so this is glucose.  down down  down like that that's glucose. And this is alpha glucose and if you think about it here when it's 6:08 attacks of a text from one way the Eraser goes down but attacks from the other way. They always goes out cuz aldehydes a planer like playing airplane or right? Okay, so you might how do you remember this is Alpha and its beta is beta goes boing open the are stupid enough mnemonics have to be easier to remember but stupid enough to remember so, you know, you have that you have that is the beta for his boring up in the air or the Greeks would write it boy.  Okay, so we're just having a great time here today is because when you make one of these alpha 1 4 Bonds in your let's get rid of this horrible lazy carbohydrate chemistry, you know, what sort of like a Lego you have a no age that can link to another one and you have an LH are they can make another one so you can make a polymer of this. This is simple linkage makes all of the difference between spaghetti and would it makes all the difference between everything so when you have an alpha one for so you think this Alpha and beta houses down on this end What's called the and nonreducing and is the reducing you have to  petsfit turn when it's Alpha One for this is easily digestible by humans and by the gut okay when it's beta 1/4  Meaning it's just instead of this for making the linkages this for making a language is harder to draw that is completely undigested Vil by nearly all organisms. Okay. So so Alpha One for linkages are starches or glycogen and glycogen not coincidentally is called animal starch. That's what it was first named his first discovered in liver tissue and so starch and glycogen are long Polymers of alpha 1/4 lengths glucose that also has occasional branches that are alpha one-six. And as I say, you probably are there in this several times in your science, you know, I probably did probably talking about in junior high now for all I know and so glycogen is the animal storage version of glucose low osmolality. You can have a lot of in the tissue without messing with the osmotic strength. What what's funny  Cheetah laughing. I don't feel left out, but I know they're just having their moment and it's just okay, so, okay, so we have and then and then plants store starch and it's a little less Branch would have basically exactly like glycogen and that sort of shown here. However, when you link it Alpha One for mrs. I mean beta one for so this is you know, the the one carbon going upwards and then linking to the four carbon in a polymer is a whole different.  It literally is a difference between sugar and sweet and would you know, I like that beat cellulose which is one version of this a long polymer of beta one for glucose is essentially not hydrolyzable by most organisms. You might have to hire a microorganism in their gut to metabolize beta-1 for sale that hard even the mighty termite that is the wood eater par exsalonce needs to recruit a eukaryote that lives in its gut in order to hydrolyzes. So it's for some reason. Can you take there must be a lot of organisms? It would capitalize on that readily available glucose is eating but for some reason beta last a long time, we can build houses with it. For example from this simple difference is a is a hugely important. Okay. So this is actually a really useful review and very useful for  Talking about nutrition and metabolism is just I I found this after the lecture material I said this is actually really useful. So you have simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates. Do you know people will admonish you to eat complex carbohydrates in a void simple carbohydrates? And of course the trouble is it's not that simple because you know there benefits to you know too much of anything. But so basically what we're talking about is 3/3 dozens of monosaccharides, you need to understand that there is no sin Rich Rosen is all sorts of saccharides and they do play Parts in biology with the main important ones for nutrition and diet are glucose fructose and galactose. Okay, and they're usually delivered to us and informs of disaccharides. Like when you eat an ice-cream cone a lot of that sugar is sucrose, you know, and when you when you are  Weather and when you drink milk, a lot of the sugar in milk is lactose. When you ferment yogurt a lot of that fermentation is through lactose being fermented and then there is maltose which is 2 glucose is and that's a result of starch breakdown and some other sources to and table sugar is sucrose which is glucose and fructose. So they're there, you know, these disaccharides that are super common. We see them all the time OK and then the other sort of other ended out of the polysaccharides which I just described it length. And so now there's not that many of them we have glycogen which is really the animal version of starts with, you know, Alpha 1 4 linkage is with the occasional Alpha one-six Branch. Okay, and then really the only difference between glycogen and starch at least in that sense is the degree of branching the truth is there's more to it and then 102 each about how glycogen has a central protein called glycogen and that's used to started going or not going to talk about  That's not that sort of a little bit to two tree and not enough for us for this class. But glycogen has some very important differences in terms of How It's Made and stored in the liver. But in terms of the carbohydrate chemistry in the carbohydrate availability is very very similar. Okay. And so then you have none of these fight versions like a milosis straight-chain amylopectin has branched chain glycogen is stored in both muscle and liver and has different Fades and then you have these indigestible and adjustable are so interesting because we can't go wrong. So the indigestible fiber is indigestible polysaccharide and microbiologically in terms of our inner play with them and we're going to talk at some length about dietary fiber in this and the next lecture and so they basically divided into two categories soluble would like pectins and that kind of thing.  Insoluble like cellulose is like when you eat a salad, you know, a lot of that is cellulose and it just passes through you you might think not interesting very interesting the benefits of the police of the carbohydrates. We eat actually arise from these indigestible ones. They have many benefits benefits the carbohydrates without talking about glycogen by glycogen is really dumb name is super Centre pay heard about it many times if you took 108 we talked about glycogen Ad nauseam cuz it's so important for maintaining performance in and then exercise but glycogen is actually the main way we store carbohydrates weather. We've ingested them or made them and restoring some of them that way and it's really a big thing about glycogen. That's great is this  Polymeric structure of going Apple in for alkaline for iPhone for Cajun when sick Southland for iPhone if that creates a storage molecule, that's really smart because if you just had a few hundred grams of glucose soluble an individual molecules in the liver the osmotic pressure would be gargantuan it would Lysol the cells the cool thing is when you start bonding the molecules together, you don't gain the osmotic power of each individual monomer you get the single particle. So you can store huge numbers of glucose monomers as starch or if your plant or or glycogen if you're a liver a muscle cell, so that's how we are glucose in the bloodstream itself. If you take the blood and you compute the 72 100 Megs per deciliter. It's about 4 grams of glucose. So in any one time the actual amount of glucose in your bloodstream is incredibly small am out of it.  Although you might have stored or being jestic. It's a tiny amount that we can control pretty rigorously. So I are about 450 G are so weird about 500 grams of like that. We story about a hundred grand liver about 400 grams in a mess. I mean, this is these two don't add up and I apologize for that. But the point is that there in those ballpark send it depends on muscle mass what you mean, you know, a lot of different things you're you're you're hormonal metabolism through these are just ballpark figures, you know, but the important thing is that they have very different states. Okay. So the glycogen in the liver is almost totally used to release glucose in the blood stream. So liver glycogen is used in liver's function as a glucose data thing that controls glucose muscle glycogen glucose monomers that are cleaved off of one of the ends of the chain. They're high.  July's by glycogen phosphorylase what you've learned about we talked a little about in here, but you've learned about it and 102 those glucose subunits cannot be released into the bloodstream a muscle cell can only use the glucose it releases in its own cytoplasm. Has anyone know why?  Sister faded distant memory needs to 5 second rule higher.  It's phosphorylated. So how come the liver can release it?  close is that the transporter but your clothes is actually pertains to the first answer s  glucose 6 phosphatase Band 3 part answer boom related has to get out can't do with the phosphorylation. It's so whoever has glucose 6 phosphatase. It's only found in that tissue and it releases free glucose. So the liver is the giver and muscles don't have that phosphatase when glucose is is released from glycogen as one phosphorylated form that gets converted to another but it never can be on phosphorylated can't get out. Okay, so that's that's actually super important exam meaning. I want this means in terms of energy metabolism stuff is the only have about a hundred grams of glucose storage available to provide to the bloodstream, you know, as as glucose molecules, it's really not a lot of Headroom is I'll show you in a minute. Okay, so back backpack  Soviet this is some of the uses of glycogen and insoluble fiber is the important category in these are the six lengths are better 1/4 lengths polymers that can't be digested unless you're a termite and so I'm or a microorganism so meet soluble fibers. They have a bunch of different Behavior. So they are found in things like pectins gums mucilages are different names for different sizable fibers and they have to do with the specific company composition molecular size, but they're basically none hydrolyzable glucose polymers. So they dissolve by bacteria in the colon to make things like organic acids and many other small molecules and do they have a lot of interesting facts and what's pretty cool is there which I'll talk about soon as they're all of these clear epidemiological enlarged study health  It's of fiber that are real. You know, I'm a impact on an incredible number of different syndromes and physiological state. So it's kind of you know, the kind of amazing and and people are passing out where that comes from what it's about and then is also inside able fiber like cellulose and Hemi cellulose. He's with a larger fibers that make stems of plants and stuff like that. They don't dissolve in water and they're actually poorly for mended by colonic bacteria. They just basically passed through but they have structural features that are super important for up for health and wellbeing. Okay. So this is sort of a review of the digestion of carbohydrates and I actually had to expand this cuz it was kind of small and this is sort of a little map of the of the GI tract in some of the accessory organs. So some starch is broken down in the saliva, you know, you probably heard of salivary amylase and are even easier to high school experiments. Were you show hydrolysis of starch that way?  There's something so salivary amylase is inactivated by the stomach but then there are enzymes produced by the pancreas, you know, like a starch amylase is that help break that down there enzymes in the wall of the small intestine is brush border enzymes that that sit there and they do a bunch of different processes including breaking down breaking down disaccharides. So enzymes in the small intestine break down disaccharides of sucrose lactose and maltose if you don't have those for instance if someone doesn't isn't able to break down lactose like a lactose intolerant person that disaccharide passes into the gut where then it becomes part of the ferment of party, you know, so that's it and it's it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it that the microbiome is in the last part of the GI tract. So if you don't get a chance to metabolize it then it ends up in this very complex ecosystem in in a bacteria or just champions of metabolizing things. It's amazing how many things there are bacteria?  Can live on a pool of benzene people have discovered these microorganisms bacteria that can sit and form a colony on pure Benzene and use that as a carbon Source. I just crazy. I don't know hyper focused on the carbs. So then you have option of glucose fructose and galactose in the small intestine. And then some soluble fiber is fermented in the gut also ran in the large intestine. So there's so there's further processing some of the fiber gets fermented graduating that can supply different things to us also to start up a map of it. But critically when you produce glucose through these beautiful amylases, you know working these these these enzymes. How does the glucose get from the small intestine into the bloodstream supercritical?  There's a sodium glucose transporter sglt1.  Sglt1 this transporter get sort of short shrift because you only hear about glute one-two-three-four. Those are the sort of Rockstar glucose Transporters that are regulated by things like insulin and are involved a different ones at different issues. And there is the glute Transporters are ones that just uniporters. They move glucose across the membrane in facilitated diffusion not shown on here, but you get the glucose into the gut it actually is a completely different kind of Transport by which is called Co transport in which is sodium ion is used to go down and grade in and pull the glucose and at the same time. So these sodium glucose transporter one is called that because it transports both sodium and glucose simultaneously and then there are pumps on the other side of the of the epithelium of the intestinal epithelium that keep the sodium keep the sodium out to make a gradient. Okay, so it pumps it out. So there's a it's an energy requiring process to keep the sodium levels low.  And that causes a gradient that pulls the glucose and so here's a glucose feeling that way once the glucose is in the brush the end of epithelium cells to hear the Little Brush borders in the microvilli. So this is the this is the Lumen of they've got. Okay and this is the basal surface in the bloodstream, you know, the the lacteals and the capillaries are bathed in that fluid may take up the glucose. So you have to see the reason I made these this guy gray is because the epithelial cells are white and it's almost impossible to tell what the cells look like without the background there. So so that's how glucose is absorbed through this sodium glucose co-transporter and a lot of a lot of sports beverages. One of the reasons they have sodium in them is to help you absorb the glucose by creating a gradient. I'm also salt is good for exercise anyways, so what's the deal with all this stuff? Like are these things just bad for us?  What are the benefits of having these carbohydrates with all of this press were getting you know, and so I want to just talk about some of the benefits of carbohydrates. I mean the real problem is the carbohydrates are so great for us that we evolved incredibly elaborate detection and acquisition systems over the million years of evolution of the human version of primate to seek out it consumed and ultimately cultivate package in Market. These molecules are the reason that there's a problem is because it's so great to have them and we have very elaborate systems that kind of firm that every step of the way. Okay, so I want to make sure to make it clear that these are very beneficial molecules like this really no better fuel than glucose. And if any of you do any kind of sports, I'm sure you know this because you can actually Discover it for yourself. But so here are some of the benefits of carbohydrates supports glycogen reserves in muscle.  Supports glycogen reserves in liver protects against ketosis and protein loss and I'll go over that and provides fiber. So this is the non-digestible portion. But all of these are important I want to talk about all of them and one of the things to remember is that blood glucose as I've said before is normally kept between us 70 in about a hundred message grams of just leave it between milligrams is a grave error you'd be dead. It's milligrams per deciliter. So forgive me for that and 3.9 millimolar is quite clear that glycogen reserves in muscle are very beneficial to carbohydrates and there's a number of ways to show that they're probably one of the best ways to just do a simple at performance experiments. So you probably heard of you know of a carbo-loading and glycogen reserves and if you go to the gym people say they're tired to go on Blanco and I run out of glycogen, you know, there's a tournament in Endurance Sports banka.  Which means you've run out of glycogen and it's actually easy to experiences go run 20 miles without eating something and you will box and I've done that and it feels very unpleasant. And so it's it's a real thing in a very easy way to show this is you can take people and and change their glycogen stores in measure what they are in the muscles involved and have them do a ride to exhaustion expand when you put them on a bicycle or an ergometer and just have them pedal as hard as I can until they can't or pedal at a certain intention to they can't that's too exhausting. I really actually great ways to study a lot of different sports physiology. So this is a beautiful ride to exhaustion experiment and it's typical of sports physiology that you get a lot of wobble in the day that you know, people are different were all completely different from each other. So when you get this kind of uniform in an experiment like this, it's pretty meaningful, but these are just going kitchen content of muscle measured in different individuals that they  This is the work time. This is the time they could work until they no longer could work anymore sza voluntary quitting experiment and correlation line. The more glycogen. You have the longer you can work and he's acting muscles. It's a really useful fuel strain. It's the fuel store of choice for high-intensity activity high intensity exercise. Okay, let me say that. Okay, so hold everything if your powerlifting for a few seconds, but we won't go and we can talk about that for a whole quarter, but we were okay so then supports glycogen reserves in the liver. So the muscle is all about the activity of those individual muscles and liver. It's all about providing glucose for the rest of the organism. So liver is very sparing and its usage of its own glucose. It stores. It is synthesized is it and it releases into the bloodstream by you said that glucose 6 phosphatase that was mentioned in the section. Okay, so the main  Reason that deliver does this is to keep that blood level. Comparative blood level at between, you know, if between 74 deciliter in a hundred and listen to vet students at the University of Wisconsin called something glucose imperative. He says that you can you can figure out all of metabolism by just anchoring all of it at the point that glucose has to be kept at a certain level in all of the metabolism sort of orbits around that imperative. It's an interesting way to look at it. So in that sense, the reason for that is your brain absolutely needs a certain level of flu, It's flexible. You can go down but if you go too low and not a lot or not 10 times really just a couple fall to lower you start getting clearer near or chemical and neurological effects. So real important for glucose to be provided by the brain and when that happens glycogen from the liver is released into the blood by the snack as we talked about and it goes right to the brain.  Now if if you have low blood low liver glycogen and you have to be providing glucose the way it happens is amino acids and glycerol. This thing is kind of crazy amino acids and glycerol are used to produce glucose. So I'm hoping you know that the the three or the two molecules that you can make are the two types of molecules. You can make glucose from are glycerol and a certain amino acids to produce Krebs cycle intermediates that are bigger than a pseudocoelom. That's it. That's the way to do it. But that has a very interesting ramifications in terms of what happens when you start starving because certain molecules can be mobilized and certain can't be okay sad that abundance gases a huge stores. If a b i a fat okay now glycerol from fat can be used to remember a triglyceride is glycerol with Three fatty acids to a little bit of it can be used. Okay, so when  When glycogen slow you have to have gluconeogenesis producing glucose. Okay. So another benefit of carbohydrates as it protects against ketosis and protein loss is so what is keto I want to try to explain this this is something that is very useful to understand. It will actually be useful in that it sort of them in the regular World cuz anyone ask you about the ketogenic diet is orbiting around this whether they know it or not is when you have the Krebs cycle, so here is acetylcholine.  Coming in with oxaloacetate to make citrate and then you go around, you know, you can ISO citrate and you have Alpha ketoglutarate.  And then you have a vicis Scituate alpha-ketoglutarate and then you have sex in old coway.  Succinylcholine and succinate and then she were eight not late and oxaloacetate never expect you to 15 years for me to be able to do that. I probably missing something so important point. Is it any molecule that enters the Krebs cycle anywhere around here from other metabolism, you can make glucose cuz this is how you make glucose is you steal oxaloacetate from the Krebs cycle. And you said pep carboxykinase if you have pyruvate you can take pyruvate make that into oxaloacetate and that's how people usually teach it and not give you eventually glucose right when glucose is low and the liver is going to make me some glucose does the brain is going to demand it and we'll die. Okay, when it's a Japanese you start diverting molecules into the glucose flow.  And you also different amino acids into these various intermediates and they go up this way happening is the usage of the Krebs cycle is completely dedicated to making glucose. And in the meantime, the liver is using fatty acids for its fuel cuz you know that fatty acid oxidation produces nadph. This is a great source of energy happening is when the liver is being told to make glucose and is not available. The Krebs cycle is running only in this way. You're actually stealing molecules from the Krebs cycle reactivity. Krebs cycle slow oxidation is super high seen a buildup of a normal functioning Krebs cycle is the acetates going to CO2. So what are Ketone bodies made from?  Anybody remember?  That's what they are. But what are they made from? This one source molecule is used to make Ketone bodies.  Anybody remember?  Nope.  Seattle, so what school is acetylcholine builds up in the when you need glucose as seen on TV items to build up because this is being diverted to glucose to be used a few of the liver. So you have lots of acetyl-coa molecules that can be produced by the liver, but they're a great alternative fuel for most of the tissues including the brain. So in situations of the liver is being taxed to make glucose. It's also making another fuel Ketone bodies and can be used by the rest of the body senses beautiful adaptation to to help spare the glucose. It's precious by making another fuel that's a result of this problem. So that's where I'm Goin In This is actually a summary of all that okay. This chart would be useful to study later, but it's actually just showing you that when you need to make glucose ear protein is diverted to make Krebs cycle Malik.  Krebs cycle molecules used to make glucose fatty acids are taken up and metabolizes helicoid builds up and then because just the km of the of the keto body enzymes is pretty high. It only starts making lots of them when you see look away level gets high and she start making this alternate fuel. It's really kind of beautiful. And so what people are doing people for many years. They ketosis with something bad that was pathological and that probably is not the case. There's an incredible experiments are where you can take people give them easily accessible Ketone bodies, which is not easy to do you have to do some chemistry to get them accessible and then test those people they'll do athletics or other physical activities in Elburn those Ketone bodies beautifully. It's actually a great fuel at even if you would have some preference. So now what people are doing is manipulating their diet in order to make this happen. Naturally, they'll eat very few carbs believe lots of fats it into the liver easily and they'll actually create a ketotic state by  Making it by making glucose scares. So this is an interesting idea and there are there are there are athletes who swear by the ketonic by the think it's just completely their performance the other people don't like it is probably very individual but this is sort of the logic of Ketone body synthesis and I think it will help if you sit back and read this. Okay. So when the important point that was when glucose is abundant this doesn't happen in glucose is abundant you have substantial flow of pyruvate through this Krebs cycle and you have sufficient production of glucose in the bloodstream that you're not demanding the liver make glucose by gluconeogenesis glucagon is low. And so it's really allows the state to not occur. It's low glucose. It triggers all are ketogenic Mayhem. Okay, so then you can start talking about starvation and it's interesting to think about  This is the opposite of nutrition like starvation is naan nutrition. But it after he teaches you how we use our different resources and fuel. So they said there's a progression to starvation and actually humans can go in incredibly long time without eating. It's amazing how long a person can go if they just eat have some water and some minerals and there's a reason for that if we evolve through thousands of cycles of feast and famine, you know, the normal human experience was when things are good we eat and when things are don't we survive and that's actually a great darwinian mechanism to develop storage modalities that work super. Well, you know, there's a so, this is actually what happens if your glycogen gets depleted is just if you're sitting on a raft or something and then then you start depleting fat and protein and after a week of slow protein degradation occurs lipids primary fuel brand uses Ketone bodies. So prolonged exposure to starvation. You start getting high levels of Ketone bodies.  The other tissues use them they're useful fuel. Like if you can't use glucose you use Ketone Bodies Okay, so prolonged starvation the amino acids be converted dcnr me to make glucose lipid stores power. The liver ketosis is high and muscle wasting have been Steve main way you make a mean make glucose in Starvation is amino acids. That's why your muscles start wasting is that the primary source of amino acids. Unfortunately unlike the liver. There's no amino acid storage Depot. It's all just your muscles. So so it kind of makes some sense. So this is actually a pretty telling picture of what happens to different fuel sources during starvation. I want you notice how little carbohydrates are we compared to fat and protein we store very very little bits of carbohydrate. We have to constantly replenishing it. So this is showing a sort of progress of starvation. Oh my gosh.  How to speak at a minute is there so there are reasonable requirements for carbohydrates. I mean, I hope I'm at least you convince you that they're super there a fuel of choice the brain needs them. It's a good way to avoid overeating abundant ketosis. It's a good way to avoid muscle wasting which happens as a consequence of long term low carb. This is why people on the ketogenic diet need to eat a lot of protein to and Saudi the daily requirement is 52/108 grams of carbs a day. So the recommended daily allowance is 130 grams for the interesting is the average consumption in the US is between 180 and 330 grams of carbs a day. So as if population are eating a whole lot more than is recommended her probably you spell I will stop there and I will definitely have a look at these questions.  UC San Diego podcast "
