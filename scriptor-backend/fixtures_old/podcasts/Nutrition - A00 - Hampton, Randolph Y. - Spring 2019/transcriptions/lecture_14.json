I need you all to be like really quiet for a second. You aren't quite anyways, we have to test the sound. Hold on. Hold on ready? Okay, it works. Okay. I'm going to show you a little video.

This is the proverbial box from which in which you put your test in a box though. This be it. This is the box and after the end of class today. I'm not taking any more.  All right, and I say I'm about just looking at them to give you more credit. I'm not about scaring you into not submitting them. Okay, that's the deal.  Okay, so and I will look at each of them. So I'll check them out myself, okay?  All right. Well, we'll text questioning were involved in this experiment with our text Master General Laura is doing a great job and you know, it's the safe and unabashed way to ask any question you like and I even go through them seems to be a lot of rumbling age need you all to chill.  Take a deep breath pay attention only to the breath watch your thoughts, but don't think them okay.  Okay, so we doing that got a couple interesting questions.  So someone asked how do pregnant women prevent vitamin deficiencies before prenatal vitamins are introduced. So like for the 300,000 years we were in existence before they were vitamin and the answer is you eat food Chanel and I will actually I'm not being cynical here is that is there plenty of very easy and direct ways to get all the vitamins weed and it's true that you know, when people don't have those supplements. It's very important to be correctly nurse because of developing embryo. That's a sort of you know, there are certain things that happened then and only then and they affect you for the rest of your life, okay?  Couple other someone asks question if B12 stays in the body longer why do vegans have such issues with B12 deficiency? It's a great question here. That's exactly the problem you decide you read a book about plant-based diets, you read thousands of studies thing that that eating more plants and less Meats good or maybe eating only plants is good. And you decide you're going to be a vegan. All right, whatever reason and you stop taking vitamin B12. It's accidental. You don't know you didn't take nutrition hear. You're a physician. You never heard a single lecture about nutrition and you don't know that vitamin B12 is missing from all plant-based sources and you go vegan and you lose some weight and you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and you lower your risk of cancer and you feel better and you look good and all your hip is friends think you're awesome because you're doing an Ethics based diet or you don't have any factory farming and there's thousands of cows and chickens and have a better life because you're not  Having them put through some sort of industrial process that raises them in microscopic cubicles, etc. Etc. Three years down the line. So you start feeling bad for having all kinds of symptoms. You can put on plant-based and I'm awesome in exactly. The reason is the B12 store is in your liver will last about three years so you can have an incredibly great diet and not even know it because this these stores are so long. So the person here actually highlighted the main issue is because B12 stays in the body so long that you can really have an issue with it. And there's plenty of people have had to figure this out. So I thought that's interesting. Let's ask an actual vegan. So this is someone who was in my 102 class many years ago and they went on to go to UC Davis and I get a Veterinary degree awesome veterinarian is great to know a veterinarian. If you have a cat cuz you can just text him and go. Hey my cats doing this and I'll go he shouldn't be V.  He's a cat and so I said question. I am teaching the class nutrition very interesting and then wondering how my smart vegan friends deal with a complete lack of vitamin B12 and all fully plant-based sources. What do you do our see we have a code I'm are and they went nutritional yeast at a multivitamin that uses like parmesan. You can put it on almost everything. So no yeast as we went over his pretty tasty. I've had nutritional yeast sprinkle on popcorn. It's not that it is sort of like parmesan cheese. So there you go an actual vegan does it now we're going to talk about vitamin C has a very special place in both nutrition and pop culture answer to that bro science that we talked about that start at that weird interface of pop culture and actual medical science and actual science and has many interests. You could actually teach a whole class.  Effects of vitamin C very interesting and I think one of the features of it has a very specific enzymatic function like other vitamins, but it also has many very general features is definitely an antioxidant it does oxidation reduction chemistry. So it has a lots of very poorly defined yet clear roles in health as well as very specific roles in enzymology. So it's a very special cofactor. This is what it looks like. This is ascorbic acid ascorbate and this is the octave. This is the oxidized form. So you notice a tow a cheer, you know, just like a lot of things we've studied can be this can give up electrons. So it's a and it it can have a free radical existence. So it's a good antioxidant vitamin C and C is found in a lot of different plant sources fruits certain vegetables and it's not hard to get if you eat the right thing. Okay, and so the one of the main functions of vitamins  It's an important cofactor in a class of enzyme called proglio hydroxylase.  I'm very excited. I'm flying to Fargo North Dakota tonight to run a marathon on Saturday. What a great Hobby.  So I'll let you know you get addicted this shit and then you're doing so here we go. So where the hell is a terms?  I got you know what I still have never remembered the photograph because I never ever ever remember. Yeah, I got an idea. Let's do this. Let's go.  Next contestant. This is supposed to be put your test in a box. It's a song.  Okay, Randy.  photograph  which is selling is this really a phone digital copy that we know what I mean photograph.

It's a collection of enzymes and they one of the main things they do is they modify college and now I don't know how much protein signs they are due to structural biology. Maybe learn. This is an incredibly important protein at 3 literally would hold us together, you know, all the joints and connective tissue. We are basically held together by hydrogen bonds and Van Der waals interactions between Heelys size of collagen and collagen unlike many protein is a triple helix, and it's a triple helix because of the proteins in it gets hydroxylated. It gives it a certain physical properties that allow it to do its structural think it's absolutely critical for Proline to undergo this hydroxylation. There's also some incredibly cool uses of Proline hydroxylation to things like oxygen sensing and we won't be talking about that but there's very neat uses of these enzymes in a lot of very fancy biology and so ascorbate  Is a I think critically important gets a cofactor just like nadh is a cofactor with things get, you know, the hydrides. I've been to them. Damn it. I would like to know what are you guys dragging around here? No wonder  It's a water supply for once let somebody selling you some fancy equipment to drink water. So anyway, this is what the proline hydroxylase residue this would be in it happened to use Alpha ketoglutarate is one of the other guys that's not so important important things. You have Proline here and hydroxyproline araceae. I know.  Hey see that awake. This is the proline. This is hydroxide and probably ascorbate along with oxygen. It's a pretty fancy enzyme is absolutely need it for that. And so one of the places that deficiencies Hoops, the deficiencies are important is in our things were when when vitamin C Runs Out you start being unable to replace collagen you get all these incredible symptoms. So we'll talk about that. But the thing about vitamin C that makes it both interesting perplexing accident. So it's a free radical trap an aqueous solution people study. The chemistry is important in the eye where you get free radicals from phytologist. Remember that beautiful I cycle with retinol sis retinol trans right now. There's a lot of electrical and biochemical activity going on in the eye needs constant maintenance and one of the version of maintenance is trapping free radicals. Okay, another's in the immune system when you have a lot of reactive oxygen species that are made  And so there's very high concentrations of vitamin C in both the eye and in white blood cells where it's important as an antioxidant. So that's where it's found in His Highest levels is in the eye and leukocytes and sew it. Also an agent iron absorption. So taking vitamin C helps other things get taken up for talking about and it's important in the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters are have lots of functions and body problem in always causes a lot of problems so high and low Vitamin C don't need a lot of it like 90 day for male adults 75 for female adults more for smokers fortunately. Most of you don't need to worry about that, but you may have patience or loved ones who you know smoke and the thing that's really amazing as you need any amount of it to avoid this disease scurvy that you probably all heard of its Sailors and other people are undernourished yet. It's only a day and you probably know people who megiddo see a lot of people take scrap loads of vitamins.  And this is where the interesting sort of interface between pop medical culture and science and medicine interface. You know, I'm in I'm sure all of you have heard about people at any time. Someone gets the sniffles. I'm going to take some vitamin C. My wife doesn't I learned a long time ago you can be happy or you can be right the last thing I want to get out of prospective. There's no need to go to XS status. Okay, so I sleep in the garage and I'm right the upper limit. It's all about being right upper limit excess intake will not absolutely rather that be true than me cuz if you're a runner or any person endurance hobbyist, I would hardly I don't even call myself an endurance athlete. I'm in endurance hobbyist.  Open you know, that kind of a hobbyist a cold is like absolutely ruins doing something like that. So very antique old but it's vitamin C. Just I went through my phases of mega dosing vitamin C when I got a little sniffle and it just takes about 3 days for it to go away really work. It took three days and went away away. Just dyed your head. Okay. Anyway, so vitamin C deficiency syndrome is a very serious thing though. And so do you get things like fatigue and pinpoint hemorrhages in a hair follicle? So this is actually a picture of normal skin and every one of those red dots as a hair follicle. That's hemorrhaging very painful. It's a very unpleasant and then the main the main symptom is scurvy which is a loss of collagen synthesis and it affects all sorts of tissues. You get bleeding gums teeth starting to fall out bone pain and eventually a slow wound healing and death. So now they're these abundant stories about scurvy.  Nautical expiration because because it was on the vitamins they take a month or two to start depleting. So you go on a long voyage and it's it also the process that treated meats that that people brought along on these voyages would have low Vitamin C they either cuz they be cooked or or or treated with the right thing. So I'm the combined effects and I'm the most interesting when I discovered recently is it's now thought that the first European Colony or the first European Village, it was started by Columbus and his men in which actually do to scurvy. They there's a site called loss Isabella which was the first settlement that because the Colombians I guess who called the Columbus is Sailors started and they tried to make it and they didn't than most of them died and that they have actually be paleo or these these historical archaeologists have found the sites examine the bones and it's quite clear that these people  Add scurvy it looks like the day actually in probably like that, you know, the indigenous people are like don't tell him about the corn and don't give them any fruit. Cuz if people are problem is if you read about the Way Columbus Street of the indigenous people, I wouldn't give them food either. So it's there you go. You get what you sow you reap what you sow, okay, but there's a kind of neat and it actually comes from this is Sheba the baby lion us and Saudi San Diego Zoological Park has been involved in in a really awesome as animal husbandry and animal. Yeah rearing and specie replenishment for many decades for a century or more and so in 1942, this little lion was abandoned by its mom. I mean, it's the sweetest thing I should get one for carbon in the New Girl Fanny carbon-carbon, but this is Shiva and she was adopted by the San Diego Zoo and did fine for a few months sounds familiar.  Force you to start getting bleeding gums and was obviously in pain and couldn't move very well and they notice all the symptoms exactly like scurvy. So everyone's always thought that cats can synthesize vitamin C because it only primates can't synthesize vitamin C but it turns out that that that be so alpha predator cats need Vitamin C sources and they normally per day a lot more so they gave Sheba vitamin C and she was fine. I think it's kind of a nice story actually found it the reference from 1942 showing this and you know, this is a third of a good Counterpoint to the whole Columbus Day. So it turns out that that primates are outliers in the vitamin C world and one of the things that had perplex people for a long time is that you have these nautical explorers getting terrible scurvy and they encounter these indigenous in which you know previously called Eskimos, but that's considered a culturally insensitive terms of the Intimates in the Arctic.  Nothing, but Glover and me and I was in their diets almost entirely meat and fat and dad are fine. It'll get scurvy dog on the answer is those animals make more than enough vitamin C cuz they're not primates to do it and that was sort of a realization. So it turns out that we are very special and our inability to make Vitamin-C know why that is interesting things about evolutionary observations is it's always questioning is it Fitness or an accident? You know what that's always the question in evolution. Is there a fitness advantage to primates not making vitamin C or is it just an accident of the lineage diverging that we've had to live with and you know, that's it's a very subtle and interesting question, but for whatever whatever reason it occurred, all primates are united in their inability to make vitamin C. And so, you know, we're very good at forging you know, we are we are adventuresome foragers.  People really haven't figured it out. So you may have heard that vitamin C cures for common cold and that was actually not true. But it was putting put forward by an absolutely brilliant a person from the 20th century named Linus Pauling and Linus Pauling is one of my science Heroes literally took quantum mechanics and converted into something everybody can understand SP2 and if you cry, but it allows any of us about basically the quantum mechanics of molecular Bond formation intuitively, which is cuz the competitions are those bonds East Ferry. If you've ever done any quantum mechanics, you don't have to have done much to go. Woah, this is pretty complex. And so that gift of telling us how to think about orbitals of a simple weight is highly predictive, you know, and highly nemonic to put in that way is the gift of Linus Pauling in the people he worked with and also all the protein structural said, he did a lot of structural biology.  Because he was very anti nuclear proliferation and early on figured out that this is something we need to have long conversations about in a lot of conversation. So, you know mazing guy but then the trouble is when you're a smart enough that everyone calls you an expert especially in sociology peace and science. People are just going to head when you say anything so, you know that he started going on this thing about vitamin C being unbelievably useful and important and powerful and I might be right beside the video. It's very confusing. It is not obvious and he did live to be over 90 white coach of the whole time. So, but anyway, I just this study came out from Linus Pauling you see his name there in 1971. They had this small study sing an intravenous high vitamin C were talking about 10.  Grams a day intravenous help people with cancer help them live longer and maybe even accurate if your people this is the thinking cause a lot of excitement and you know, this is a scientist lot of clots of the Mayo Clinic conducted a good double blind studies control studies on cancer patients and found there was no benefit but they did it orally so it's a long wait, but they didn't do the exact same thing. This is one of the frustrating things about being said, he's like, this is so you can't just go back to the lab next week and do it. If we got to try it again, you know, it's especially if they've passed from cancer, you know, this is a problem. There's a number of cell culture studies. So there's been a number of studies with patients that have not panned out as you'll see this number a simple cell culture City. You can take cancer cells in culture dishes and show that vitamin c does all sorts of things to bollix them up and then there's these are just too.  Dozens and dozens of scientific papers showing vitamin C added to culture cancer cells. Let's ask Michael Greger about this. So Michael Greger is actually a guy who does an absolutely amazing website and there was a book I didn't get it into this particular lecture, but he has an incredible website called.  nutrition  Jesus nutrition facts one word  . Org  This is an amazing amazing sight nutritionfacts.org. And the thing I don't like about Michael Greger. That's absolutely amazing. And and really interesting is that he's a physician in a board-certified physician Internal Medicine guy in a typical Doctor Who decided he really really really wanted to understand how nutrition impacts on health and medicine but you didn't want to do it through anecdote. He want to do it only by studying and reading the scientific literature. And the reason he got into this thing is as a child is incredible story that he tells his grandmother had terrible congestive heart disease she was and she went to a doctor and they basically said you're going to die, you know, he knows she has terrible atherosclerosis and arteries in really sick could barely walk and she was I think 60 at the time and she went to a doctor who said that, you know, it's too late. You should take care of your affairs.  Is nothing we can do she then went to another person who changed your diet she and very way before this was Hep. She went on to a completely plant-based diet is almost out of desperation cuz they know there was some some observations that was the case and this lady live to be another 20 years older she lived into her eighties and she got better much faster and it just I don't know whether what that's about but inspired him to say, what's that all about into his frustration as a medical doctor going through the ranks of medical school and internship and having jobs, he notice it and no one ever ever thinks about nutrition and its impact on the health field on maintenance of Health on helping people are sick on avoiding illness. So he sort of his Pioneer of of science-based Wellness. His mission has been to do nothing but study the literature of nutrition studies and nutrition science and see what we can extract from it and it's absolutely amazing that so the thing about this site,  Then you guys were like as you like, you know video Snippets tweets, you know whole books is challenging and I get it cuz we live in the ocean of information is all of these videos about 5 minutes long and there's over a thousand of them that he's made himself in man is possessive try that plant-based energy. He has he's a man possessed. He also went on the road giving talks everywhere. He could to the extent that he lost his first marriage which he talks about honestly because he was so driven to do this. And now this is stabilize any actually wrote an amazing book that I will show you who called this is a great book on how not to die.  How not to die and basically he goes through all 50 major causes of death and describe all of the prospective retrospective case-control in a double-blind studies. You can find that address these different causes of death it is it will change your life not going to read a book. I got plenty to read. Okay, if there's if you read one book this year One book this year read this book, especially if you want to be a physician, especially if you want to be a physician's assistant, especially if you want to be a nurse, especially if you want to be an osteopath, especially if you want to do anything that has to do with health maintenance trust me. It is incredibly readable incredibly interesting and the audible book is kind of fun to I'm listening to it while I drive I got to pull in the big top nevermind.  But I have this. Oh this this is why I like this this guy because he he says, okay, what's the deal with the vitamin C situation and you will see how complex C's cities are in the the fact that hoe don't go it's going to be okay. There you go. Awesome the moment. You said here's a moment. I could do this. I'm not going to like hide the box or the class because it's you know the internet and let's see what happens. Can we get to it interesting facts. Org?  Okay.  So far so good. Grandpa's operating the internet. Okay. Let's see.  Now can we hear it?  Studies in the 70 show an extraordinary Survival game internal cancer patients with vitamin C is simple relatively non-toxic there are bringing some no wonder I got a lot of attention Specialists or reported by a world-renowned scientist Linus Pauling but starting with a product is rather than treatment effectiveness of oral vitamin C where she probably successful seventies experiments also gave vitamin C intravenously and we didn't realize until the 90s that the same dose given IV can lead to higher levels in the blood stream. So maybe high dose vitamin c does help.  Encouragement case reports continue to be published. I hear there was a regression remission and Q are documented individual case of advanced kidney cancer bladder cancer lymphoma, but that's 3 success stories of how many I mean if it was 3 out of 100 Raven threw out of a thousand. Okay, if the treatment is sufficiently non-toxic but there's evidence that IV vitamin C's widely used in the alternative medicine world as in 80% 86 % practitioner serving. I just as 172 practitioner Lone Tree in about ten thousand patients a year USA manufactures, and they're selling hundreds of thousands of vials of the stuff in the US and now it's not being used for cancer seemed less and present.  No matter how amazing these cases seemed it possible to cancer just spontaneously on their own and it was just a coincidence for sure. You have to put it to the test.  Today, there's been some small pilot studies in the results. So far have been disappointed. The good news. Is that even insane doses of IV vitamin C seem remarkably safe, but fail in the study of two dozen patients to demonstrate anti-cancer activity similar small Studies have been published all the way through the present with tantalizing but what we do know is that the present state of cancer treatment is unsatisfactory people have this perception that chemotherapy with significant enhancer chances for a cure, but put all our cancer-killing chemo together and the overall contribution to 5-year survival is on the order of 2% all the side effects for 2.1% at a cost. I will maybe $100,000 per patient per year.  So it may be worth looking deeper into therapies like IV vitamin C. However the lack of financial rewards and against alternative medicine could dissuade conventional investigators and funding agencies from seriously considering this a pro so decades later. What can we conclude after trials which have been towed at least 1,600 patients over 33 years. We have to conclude that we still don't know whether vitamin C is any clinically significant anti-tumor activity?  Although there is currently no definitive evidence of benefit. The Mayo Clinic randomized control trials did not negate a potential benefit based on what we now know about the oral versus IV routes of administration. So kind of back to square one. Does it work or not? There are highly probable both sides, but I'm in complete Dana at what we need are carefully controlled clinical trial question is what do we do until then but it's only relatively non-toxic serious cases of kidney injury reported to me after all if it's so safe. Why did our bodies about 2 so tightly control against excess absorption?  It can also be expensive and time-consuming each infusion cost. I wanted $200 out-of-pocket since it doesn't pay for which can be quite a boon for alternative medicine practitioners about 90% of the Millions for profit Arrangement. So there's Financial pressures, you're pushing both directions for and against this treatment given the relative safety and expense control. Okay find the vitamin C question can be put to rest once and for all but and cancer treatment. We don't have the luxury of jettisoning possibly effective relatively non-toxic treatment. We should revisit promising Avenues without prejudice and with open minds.  Okay, here's the here's the scary part. Did it work? Okay, so we're back to this. Okay. So the thing I want to make a point when an egg is I know that was a lot of information so that's good cuz it's short and wide information and I suggest that this is a great place to start now, you know, one of those things about the Michael Greger Cannon and I don't mind as long as he makes the point he makes of a really interesting points is you notice the phrase tainted by alternative medicine that if you have too much pop cultural mumbo-jumbo, especially that doesn't pan out there is an understandable resistance of academics and Professional Medical people to embrace something like that cuz people might perceive them colleagues as well as patients as well as funding organizations is being not critical and not analytical. So that's one part of it and other part of it is that you know, he makes the point that you can tell just from the from the Commerce.  How much Vitamin C is been sold the number of a pharmaceutical vials of vitamin C cuz they do packaged that there's been thousands hundreds of thousands of dosas purchase somewhere out there and presumably get it to intervene as vitamin C and given to people probably an alternative medicine and yet you don't have this Groundswell of people saying I've been cured by cancer which you would hear about on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. You haven't see it. So there's some really interesting complex issues the frustrating thing for students cuz you like to have answers that you take his knowledge and I get that is a really isn't a solid answer but I want you to appreciate that about 55 or 60 papers went into him putting that video together. It is an absolutely astonishing thing that this individual does and even those opinions are that you know, and and their Fair opinions that because vitamin C is cheap and not really patentable and not druggable there might also be resistance on that angle true enough. It's worth thinking of  These things on all of the angle. So I like that it's new that is complex and that IT addresses these issues through through science through trying to look at the studies that I've actually been done and that is his deal. Thank you. Michael Greger. Okay. So this is us some other stuff. So now let's talk about multivitamin and at what is are they good or bad in this whole video? We just watched really leads to this interesting question of how do we appraise things like this in off in the frustrating but intriguing thing in studies like nutrition is there's good and bad there's pros and cons and one of the phrase is it's moving around, you know, the sort of that what we called the pods Veer or might we might call it via, you know, the world is this idea of an experiment of 1 that each person is an experiment of one and this is Miss. You could say that the technical side of that has ended  July's medicine every genome has a little bit different everyone's experience their epigenetic print. There. Are there at nutrition is different the other side you can say it's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, but the interesting question is how different are different people in terms of treatment modalities and it's an open question. So often you get pros and cons. It really would be Pro for some people in cod4 other people in our job is to try to figure that out. So you multivitamins. There's a study, you know, there were studies. This is a study with 27 Trials of 400,000 people. So one of these meta-analysis said that there's no clear evidence of beneficial effect of supplement on all cars were tied. This is vitamin supplements, like taking multivitamins on all the cars my tality cardiovascular disease or cancer another study from the Physicians health study. We talked it was one of these huge perspective studies in which they studied up a large number 5947 men over the course of 12 years. He's our health professionals that could be in a easily monitored and participant there.  No difference between the multivitamin and Placido groups in overall cognitive performance or verbal memory. So, you know, that would be something you think might be helpful kind of a negative and your people take these studies going to stop wasting your money making expensive urine by taking large mirror while taking multivitamins when it's you know food sources are the way to go. Okay. So this is one thought what sources are definitely prefer, they're safer and more complete and I one of the things we've already talked about and if you've done your quiz scussion yet and you will tomorrow we talked a bit about we try to create some ideas about the difference between supplementing one item like beta carotene and a carotenoid rich die at and what are the differences what's going on? And that's actually a pretty complex quiz scussion as your as your eyes and he's will tell you is really two things that happened in that process. Is it currently Rich diet cause benefit the beta carotene alone cause a disc benefits. So we need to we need a hypothesis that says, why does the rich diet help and why does Barrett beta carotene help?  There's a connection between us it's a real thought experiment and you know, your creativity is as useful as anyone else cuz no one really knows yet. Why those two things are exist like that. So but in general are food sources are preferred are safer and more complete and fearsome really need examples of the beta-carotene versus vegetables in the lung cancer that you now know about the karat vs. Carat to be sort of funny about it. And then there's actually some others in single apple and I saw a couple people eating apples during the movies is cool to bring food to movies. I like to do it to Apples a good choice is a single Apple's equivalent antioxidant activity of 3.5 grams of vitamin C. Are you Michael does that mean antioxidants it all not only work together but evolve together as a human edible plant is a mammal edible plants. So very interesting that you know, this Synergy between phytochemicals remember a cup of coffee  He has a thousand molecules in it thousand different molecules a plant has five or six thousand phytochemicals in it that are mostly completely unknown intriguing so supplements. And in some cases supplements can be harmful in excess vitamin A causes liver toxicity folate increases the risk of colon cancer, you know when you have its own oxygen also, so the take-home message from these kind of concert is if there's no deficiency taking more might even be harmful, you know, so that's one aspect those Pro aspects to so, you know, although a well-balanced diet. This is from the annals of internal medicine. This is a legit Bonafide Journal of army people weigh and who have a lot of knowledge about these things in there. View to other people read them and they say this article says that although well-balanced diet is usually the best way to get essential nutrients few persons in the US follow the dietary guidelines consequently most persons the US are not well nourished and this is interesting because  From when I was a child like the 1950s was everybody in the u.s. Is well-nourished. I mean this is already in Acura because there are pockets of grave starvation in poverty Even in our wonderful country. Okay, so that's but even if you take the average person eating well upper-middle-class middle-class person because of the food supply in the nutrient deficiency of these calorie-rich foods that we will talk about. There are many people who have dietary deficiencies that go undetected. They don't have like scurvy and they don't have beriberi but there's a big gray or a between scurvy and very berry and Optimal Health and that's the interesting, you know spot to study. Okay. So most adults in the u.s. Do not get the era eyes are vitamins a d and magnesium potassium and calcium from their diet conversely person is taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement formulated and approximate the daily value will fill many of these nutritional gaps effectively safely in at low cost. So the other side of the coin is  Who is dietary deficiency specially in subtler ways and you're giving them the diseases you learn about in med school or here but you know any sort of subtle ways that might have, you know decrease productivity bobbed feelings of well-being, you know quality of life interesting. So that's sort of the pro and so, you know hears them here actually some studies that are you know, more details multi-vitamin mineral uses associate with reduce risk of cardiovascular disease mortality among women in the United States. That was a 2015 study at large. So you multivitamins in the prevention of cancer in men. This is you know, so the Physicians house that is no advantage to cognitive defects found in the similarly that multivitamins might help in the prevention of cancer so mean, it's a mixed bag and sometimes one thing we'll do something and not something else, you know, so General these are actually pretty interesting. This is from the CDC and other in a government organization the Center for Disease Control.  Lots of really good epidemiologist know the scientist work there and so here are some things that are over consumed in under his him. So sodium and saturated fat and I would say sugar also, although they didn't put here is overconsumed in our culture from matically over again soon and some of the under consumed things are vitamin D potassium calcium iron and fiber. Okay. So these are all the way under the movie.  You know, it's a n d I will say this is a little personal hyperlink. I have actually drastically changed my diet since teaching this class and I'm afraid we might even go plant-based. I'm not quite ready to go the vegan route, but it says it is you can't teach this class and not come home already like this, but I bring this little snack box now would like carrots and broccoli and all these carotid and then I forget I have it and go eat something crappy like everyday are the strawberries if you don't it's like it's like you buy those reusable bags to go to the supermarket, but you always leave them in your car and then you buy another one and you forget a new bike has her a buck. And do you have a car full of reusable bags at 6 like you're going to live there. So if this is the same kind of thing, but okay, so now we're going to switch to talk to you about minerals. Okay, so these are minerals.  Don't mean that other here's a fun biological hyperlink. I didn't realize is that 70% of the minerals on Earth, you know, these cool gemstones and minerals are due to biology are due to the interplay between the Earth's animals and organisms and the geological sphere Sol a huge number of the organisms. I mean of the minerals on Earth are due to biological processes, which is kind. I didn't know that I read that like a year ago, very cool. Very interesting. There's this deep deep interaction between the Earth and the organisms. So here's what we're going to talk about calcium phosphorus magnesium, electrolyte iron. Zinc and I-10 is going to go from this lecture into the next lecture to so we're going to talk about these and one of the main ones are going to talk about his sodium cuz sodium is a major major dietary problem and a major health problem that every one of us is participating in accidentally.  We're going to think about that a little bit here.  Why do smokers need more vitamin C. The thinking is that there's a lot more oxidative incursion on the tissues all the time generation of carcinogens oxidative damage to the lungs and vitamin C is definitely helpful in that kind of awareness so that you you're chewing up more vitamin C and having more of it on board might be helpful. That's the thinking and I think this is strictly from epidemiological studies. So this is just a body composition chart with many many pretty colors. So this is actually just the amount of these minerals grams in the human body of these different minerals or not, you know grams is census 400 and something grams in a pound, you know, these are not huge numbers, but they are calcium is very abundant phosphorus sodium sulfur, I mean potassium sulfur sodium chloride into these very minor minor think some of them quite important anybody watching Chernobyl on HBO is crazy crazy crazy miniseries.  Not the Chernobyl incursion turns out iodine is super important in that anyways, I don't want to spoil no spoilers The reactor blows up damn it ruin the window. So, okay. So going this way. It turns out that one of the interesting features of mineral nutrition is there were actually plant items that help there are there are dietary a processes and dietary practices that help mineral absorption and their dietary practices and dietary items that hurt. So there's actually it is one of the very rare cases were things in Plants might do something bad, you know, I mean, there are things in plants that are problematic like morphine and cocaine but there's so many plant items are. All right awesome, but there are turns out they were both auntie and pro nutrients in plants that either enhance or hurt uptake of minerals. This is a fan.  Complex chart from a review article meeting people thought a lot about this but here's just a little mini list cuz I just want to know a few of them. So they're factors that increase bioavailability and that's a great word. I don't have to learn that word yet, but it's a great word bioavailability.  How many of you have heard that word?  Find some few so bioavailability is just the degree to which something is taken up in the body and ends up in the bloodstream. This is available to the organism when it's consumed or taken. Usually it's oral cuz that's the hard part bioavailability intravenous is pretty obvious is just the amount you load / the volume of the blood. So that's usually pretty intense by a man. But this is one of my availability is a major important important feature of both Pharmaceuticals in food items. So 1 in an interesting ideas. The glycemic index is really telling you the bioavailability of glucose as it's come from different sources, although no one ever refer to it that way but so if you're taking a mineral Source how much of it actually ends up in the bloodstream is related to the bioavailability is batted around all the time. And so  So these are these are some of the some of the things that are the decrease bioavailability reduce gastric acidity. So if you're taking something that reduces gastric acidity, you have some kind of problem phytic acid from whole grains oxalic acid and leave your vegetables and someone here mentioned oxalic acid + calcium confirm kidney stones. It's absolutely true. But also oxalic acid can bind calcium for the same reason and not allow it to enter the gut. So it's it's a double thing polyphenols in tea coffee and red wine. That doesn't mean you shouldn't drink coffee to the red line is just means that you know certain cases where people are trying to load this and they have these things are problematic high-dose supplements as single minerals, you know can actually bollocks up the absorption of other mineral. So these are the kinds of things are thinking about so here is some of the some of the the different anti-nutrients so phytic acid is when it's actually is polyol this natural Pagliacci.  Inositol it's a six-member grant looks like a sugar not but it looks like one found in high quantities and whole grains Beez nuts other places. I'm East breakdown phytic acid. So living in bread actually makes it okay, but in cultures that eat unleavened bread, do you can actually have a substantial amount of phytic acid that I had two blocks uptake of certain minerals oxalic acid, which has high concentration spinach actually make spinach not a very good at bioavailability source of calcium for that reason. Tanen's, you know, they can be an energy nutrient is in the ions that are especially susceptible to Z and you just calcium iron and zinc and not surprised. He those are all lions it form good chelation complex as if you learned that in chemistry, they have multiple charges in large D orbitals and they can be calculated easily. Okay. So we talked about calcium calcium is super important. It's a Venda trouble with calcium is the absorption.  Average from all your dietary sources You observe about 25% of the total. So just looking at how much calcium is present in something you're eating is need not be enough, you know, so you have to think about that one has to think about is, you know, several functions of calcium in this are the two main forces one is calcium is in ion doing all that wonderful excitability heartbeat muscle contraction neurotransmission the stuff you've learned about in your cool new row and Physiology classes, you know, it's basically the result of a tissue that wants to do exocytosis, whether it be a neuron or a muscle or in or contraction like a muscle or a beta cell, you know that wants to release insulin or any of the neuroendocrine cells at 1 amp fuse vesicles with the plasma membrane. It's all about elevating calcium. And so and it's very important neurotransmission muscle contraction. I should have hormone release Here Also and this is her to one of the many pictures of see if calcium entering a synapse and then causing these cool process is to  Where you get release of things through membrane Fusion guy, but the other function of calcium that's you know is super important is as a domain ion for depositing bone-in for making bone, you know, hooray for our skeletons that allows us to do so much great stuff, you know being a jellyfish is beautiful but doesn't have a lot of potential for powerlifting. Okay. So so study of the function of structure with a major component of bone and teeth as this molecule hydroxyapatite.  funny name hydroxyapatite  and this is a calcium phosphate polymer or mineral. It's used to build bone. Okay, and the thing about bone is although you look at a boner feel it. It feels really hard and you know, it takes even a lot of effort to break it and they last deep into time when in an organism dies, the bones are around and then they can you know, the mineralized is bone is incredibly Dynamic. It's a living thing and the addition of calcium to bones are showing the first 25 years old like 25 years. Your bonus is constantly being built up in added to and and then after that it's a dynamic they were you have a breakdown in synthesis. So you get Nat Edition up to about 20-25 years and then you start getting was called turn over and one of those things about the body in general is pretty much every molecule in your body is turning over once a year, you know, you pretty much replace your entire contents once a year was just pretty amazing to think about cuz we don't look any different from you in a little bit.  You're a totally new person, but they are completely replaced or molecules Dynamics are in a really interesting part of biology. So it turns out there's two basic cells that do this is the osteoblasts that build bone in the osteoclasts that that break down bone. Okay. So those are the two I'll see you again. This is review from physiology and you probably had this in a lot more detail than I'm talking about it in your physiology classes, you know, and and the way I remember it that glass filled and classed collapse, but it would ever since those are they work, you know, there are stimulated different things and it's the balance of that they create your constant bone structure and density McKay. So it turns out there's a very fancy hormonal regulation of calcium and this thick a million Graphics. This is one that would be useful for you.  Salmon later when you look at it, and so it's basically showing here's the start of net changes in blood calcium levels and when calcium is high one set of things happened that involve hormone calcitonin and when calcium is low and another set of things happen that involve a hormone called parathyroid hormone. So but there's a number of different. So this is the sort of Nigel Crawford way just a list of things would just be so then I found some nice Graphics to talk about this. So calcium is too low you got an increase in parathyroid hormone, which increases Kelsey trial, which is this the active vitamin D. Remember vitamin D12 25 vitamin D3 is also called calcitriol and so is parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of this in the kidney and Kelsey mobilization from the bones, you know making so the bone is also a reservoir of calcium and when you need more in the blood cuz it's super critical to have correct levels of it for all that excitability stuff. It's a reservoir.  You get retention in the kidneys or doesn't get gotten rid of and you increase calcium uptake from the intestine. So it's really a complete motivation thesaurus release. Is it the kidney stop getting rid of it and they got starts taking it out. That's a highly coordinated process orchestrated by parathyroid hormone in vitamin D and calcium is too low you get another hormone called calcitonin produced and calcitonin decreases parathyroid hormone levels and causes you no calcium release decreases calcium released from the broad and just basically decreases all those things that were big increase in the other case. So it's just push and pull going on. So this is actually another picture of this or this is it shows the sword of body maps and these things are parathyroid gland releases it that's it near the thyroid next to the thyroid and parathyroid hormone acts on osteoclasts. It also acts in the kidney do to make active vitamin D and conserve calcium and vitamin D.  New one to 25 vitamin D3 X on the small intestine to increase absorption. So it's a combined thing of the hormone and then vitamin D activated vitamin D2 gets made and the other case with high blood calcium you get this other hormone calcitonin that's also released from that parathyroid here and it is released from the thyroid gland actually in calcitonin axon osteoclast cells. Low one axon the blasts to get you know, two ways to improve calcium release and the other one axon the osteoclast to take up calcium to remove it from the blood lower the level. So this is Austin going on at synthesis removal and uptake that's going on all the time. OK it's over calcium the RDA in the recommended daily allowance and per day and the in his interest in the UL based on kidney stones. Like it was mentioned in one of these text questions is around 2.5 grams today something for day. Some people are a different risk for 4.  Are kidney stones and others and once people have them they seem to be easier to get so this is very the thing. It's a little disturbing about this is that if you go to buy supplements, you can buy these calcium and Vitamin D supplements, you know, the in fact that you have delicious chewy gummies. You can get it at Costco in Minot. You can end up taking a crap load of calcium from those things without knowing plus they're amazingly delicious. So you find yourself getting a plus. There's this new thing where people are saying that very high vitamin D3 levels are good at preventing infection than that might be pop science. I think there's some studies in imply this so you got this sweet spot of how much vitamin D3 should you take? How much are you prefer being calcium to the Des benefit? How much are you advancing not getting an infection or an illness? So interesting how these are some calcium-rich foods of see there's a question of my mom always told me not to eat spinach and tofu together and I don't think she knew why so it was really interesting to see if supported by Sia.  Mom knows does drinking milk actually help you grow when you are a little I never drank my milk be well-nourished allows people to grow to their full genetic and nutritional potential. Why does high blood calcium in low blood calcium both increase calcium of taking a note that mule noticed I had decrease these things or one increases the other decreases on that table here. That's maybe not so clear. So here I have increased calcium uptake decrease calcium uptake so good. But okay. So these are the things calcium-rich food kale milk. This is one of the things about, you know, the rise of the Agricultural and Dad Dairy world are lactose intolerant.  Utahns that we are is it as milk is such an amazingly good source of nutrients. Okay. So and for the same reason you want to give calcium to little children so they grow is KO is a pretty good source of calcium a cop a cup of chopped kale is 94 mg a milk is 305 and also a sew-in you can absorb a fair amount of it. But you know a cup of kale is about 9 a cup of milk is 30% of the daily calcium you need so if milks are really good source of calcium, you know, it's a good source of a lot of things every one of the very best plant sources of calcium is collard greens, which is a very southern food. If you go down south you off and go if you go to a a good soul food restaurant in south or in the Oklahoma collard greens will be right there along with the Fried Chicken in the Corn and cornbread and all that great stuff to eat your collard greens. If you go to a self-employed supercritical  Are much better at being absorbed it has more kit has more calcium and it's similar to absorb. So a cup of collard greens with can be very delicious. And you know, it's almost 30% like a cup of milk. So if it's food choices important and so one of the things that's in that that I noted before is it the bioavailability of calcium can really be different so for milk products, but you said the estimated sorption this is the percent of sorts and so milk about 30% of soreption from a source bok choy, really good but not super high, you know, so you calcium absorbed for a amount of bok choy, is it submits very available, but you don't get as much as milk. So it's a trade-off and spinach like that individuals. Mom said is even though it's pretty high in calcium in very poor teams are because spinach is rich in oxalate, you know, so that I can just hold onto the couch as you're not going anywhere. Popeye. Okay, so that's variability.  Fortunately, these things are known. We have some text questions.  That was a question. What are the benefits of vitamin D and immune system? I don't think it's very well known anything about vitamin D is this is mega dosing vitamin D people taking thousands of units a day beyond are near the UL and it's you know, the I think it's partially anecdotal and some studies but no one really knows why the thing to remember about vitamin D is that it is a transcription activator. It is a molecule that binds to a receptor vitamin D receptor and stimulates the production of many genes. You know, it is a is a broad transcriptional activator and does lots of things. So, you know, it's it it's not surprising as many actions and then when you take a lot of it knows maybe what are on pathway meaning what a vitamin D normal is it normally doesn't do it at higher doses. It might I don't think that's well understood go to look into it more. Good question though. Okay, are there any real life questions?  Yes.  What is when it's low when calcium slow the intestine increases up take from the diet and when it's high you get decrease so, you know, the parathyroid hormone tends to through vitamin D increase in touch construction to calcitonin decreases it so it didn't make sense to get you get to where you yell Levy ating the the signal when it's high. You want to lower it by decreasing absorption increasing excretion decreasing bone mobilization. I want to show you what increase bone mobilization increase uptake and decrease excretion. So they all started their other piece, okay?  are there  okay. So these are some calcium sources of reiterating is dairy. Leafy greens collard greens is the best spinach high in calcium in poorly absorbed because of oxalic acid supplements now stuck a little myself in another place with supplements are very interesting so supplements because he was easy to take it and like I say, they're delicious gummies both with calcium and with calcium and vitamin D3 supplements or calcium carbonate one. That's the cheapest calcium citrate if you have problems with low acid in the GI and their natural sources of calcium, like oyster shells and Bone calcium, but they can be problematic of those are highly concentrated source is so anything that the animals have picked up the oysters or the bones could be problematic. So, you know, that's it. That's a choice and I like I say and we have to really talk about this more of the supplement industry is incredibly poorly regulated and it's poorly regulated strictly from for financial reasons. Do you know there are certain states have passed laws?  Supplement production that are you know strictly for commercial benefit and if there's an amazing number of stories of supplements that have been released that have been been demonstrated to be very bad. And we removed from the market the most egregious. When is it a modern mild stimulant called ephedrine that you can get ephedrine teeth and adapters really problematic. There's a there's another another supplement called Hydroxycut. You probably heard of it supposed to make you like slim and be a fat burner that has caused many many medical problems that are well-documented. So this is a number of these different supplements and it all starts with them being poorly regulated. Okay, we'll talk more about that. So here's the thing. This is actually a study done by the British medical journal in 2008 clearly showing that calcium increase the risk of of myocardial infarction tomorrow to call infection is to type of heart attack in event of v-fib infarction that can be glitter.  Life-threatening and you have the calcium group received. This is a woman study with several thousand women 1400 women. I mean is that this is a a plot showing this is over a long. Of time that there's an increased risk of our conversation doesn't mean if you take a risk ratio. So it's a percentage risk. So that's one way to look at it. This is also done by meta-analysis. So this is been looked at quite a bit. And so this is the myocardial infarction in this is actually the numbers were the people are at risk going to risk. So you are the important point is he's aren't huge numbers. This is one of the perplexing things about these kinds of studies. See you have the calcium people's you know, the of 12,500 12300 and I was young 11800 vs 11700 and you actually have to use statistics to figure out from these meta-analyses. Is this real? You know, when and how should it affect your life if you're taking calcium supplement  You don't get enough of your diet and that might be worth the mild risk of a heart attack and you can do other things. So it's it's it's it's one of the tricky things, you know, and so this is actually be meta-analysis kind of thing where they have this line is out favors Placebo in this favors calcium, and now there's a lot of broad statistical is wobbling. If you can see the error bars on these different things. He looks like there's a mild but easily damaged it was not easily you need thousands of people but they clearly demonstrable statistically significant risk from taking calcium supplements. So here's some of the calcium supplements reduce bone turnover and slow the rate of bone loss. However, they have a weak effect on fracture rate. So there's a small effect on bone Dynamics Arbonne physics so it but on the other hand trial & Noble in Siesta calcium supplements increase the risk of cardiovascular disease meta-analysis and calcium supplements 30% increase risk of Mario cardial infarction 12 to 20% increase  Stroke so you got to realize a 30% risk does not mean 30% of people are going to get it means that whatever the risk is its 1.3 times more than that. So it's not a huge snowed by these numbers and feels like there's a 3% risk. It is easier than one-third of the people that take calcium are going to like a heart attack at 30% increase in Risk means it can be  it can be confusing sometimes Soco administration of vitamin D and calcium does not lessen these adverse effects cuz sometimes calcium can help you know, is it is a balancing Factor. So here's the interesting thing is the high total high calcium in a meal is about 500 mg for male, you know, so inhibit. Can inhibit zinc and iron uptake if you have too much of it cause blood calcium to spike and it rained Kris the risk of blood clotting so high calcium supplements along with a meal can be problematic. So the idea of a keep total calcium to a less than half a gram from you avoid calcium supplements in this division. This would be some sort of home-baked advice for people. Okay. Now let's talk about the opposite side of that is very important syndrome called osteoporosis and I'll be many of your part of osteoporosis. And if you have aging relatives, you might be experiencing it directly than different age groups get it.  Your price is defined by the World Health Organization is a bone mineral density a 2.5 standard deviations below Peak bone mass to 20 year old sex match healthy person averages what they do and I'd miss it's not this is from Nigel. He has all these things on the size of what you're supposed to know and he just escaped from that. I want to get rid of that before anyone goes  I will tell you what you need to know on the study list as I've always promised. So when I get rid of that, okay, so a peak bone mass reach of yours, then net loss of bone mass. You get what happens is when you get to be 20 25, you get different rates of bone mass loss everybody experiences this and that rate can vary with people with genetics with diet out with other factors. Okay? And so this is the sort of conundrum something like twelve million adults in the US have osteoporosis those 300 million people 350 million people in the can maybe 400 now I have encountered lately, but you know, it's the elder population Iran osteopenia, and that means I'm not osteoporotic but I'm getting close and then 43 million have low bone density. That's me. So, you know, it's pretty pretty common thing.  Price at least two 1/3 1/2 of women having at least one fraction or lifetime. So this is definitely something that affect women more because of a number of Jeff RX the toilet xx's more and and and this is now so there's been a lot of study of women osteoporosis, but both both biological genders get it. Okay. And so this is sort of what it looks like his normal bone density looks like no Google Matrix, you know far less than two great big interstices like this and it actually affect posture in a variety of ways and one thing it's very distressing is is an early indicator of osteoporosis is postmenopausal shrinking not going to tell you something everybody who gets to be my age start shrinking. I used to be almost five 8 now. I'm 5 6 and I found this out by challenging a friend of mine about who is taller and then we did that back-to-back thing and  Shrinking I noticed my dad who I miss he's long gone, but she got much smaller to the point where I could like take it was incredible everybody. But the people with low bone density start shrinking pretty traumatic like an inch and a half two in and you will see this with people, you know who her or aging? Okay. So this is sort of the graph of osteoporosis and this is all about bone density and all about osteoclast osteoblast activity. So this is a healthy bone mineral density here. This is important come back in here. Okay. So so here is Asti. I shouldn't do that. You people have stuff to do they got to go places after I'm sorry. Okay, so I'll be bone mineral density, you know in this is the scale isn't you and this is just a qualitative difference. It's a few different and everybody starts going down. So then this is our Lobo  Mineral density is here. And this is um, and you know what? I'm not sure what these three curves are. I think this is is is ipso population of people who have over osteoporosis and then there's a subgroup Easter people. This is a subgroup of people who remain okay, and it's the people who end up having us because osteopenia eventually becomes it very late life like 70. So here's where I am. I'm here.  Getting close. I want to be a peer. So I would have to start doing is is resistance training and jump roping know that which I hate so but I have to do that. You know, what you thought. To live long enough. Okay. So so we osteoporosis risk factors are long-term deficiency and calcium and vitamin D intake and these things can you to work over long periods of time if you have any help or deposition cuz you'll notice there's her it's worth going back to this you'll notice this is a structural difference. Like this is a very drastic difference in bone structure from here to repairing that by just suddenly get any osteoclasts to us to stop what they're doing in the osteoblasts and do what they're doing is not going to immediately cure you it is a gradual process is a pharmaceutical challenge to cuz there's so many people with it. So estrogen loss. This is one of the reasons it that it's it's it's focused on the women who have high estrogen.  Is any activity weight-bearing resistance training and I do not know personally why weight training in and load activity increases off the bone density and I want to learn why I'm interested in that. I don't know I realized I didn't know when I was writing is like I don't know why that is an exercise class for God's sake over 30 years. Okay high sodium caffeine alcohol intake smoking Cola either kind of a claim. It affects only women. Not men. I don't know if I believe that acid reflux medication and genetics. So the worst there's actually, you know, sort of a Geo genetic difference. So Asian and Caucasian or worse than Hispanics worse than Latina worse than African African Americans are the best just in terms of do, you know call Jamie genetic Origins it now we're getting a lot of you know, a lot of a  A lot of spread throughout populations as they travel more nor less isolated. So the prevention is weight-bearing exercise adequate calcium in the diet high protein vegetables and good choice of genetics. So this is there's actually this is one thing that the pharmaceutical industry is very interested in although again in his problem. There's very good nutritional approaches to this is a good idea, but the pharmaceutical industry has a reasonable steak in this game because so many people end up with osteoporosis. It can be really problematic and really affect quality of life. And once you are osteoporotic, you know, it's hard to resume exercise rich life and that kind of thing. It's challenging. So there's a number of different drugs. Some of them have very dubious utility a new ones called a blow parked at the side table power a time, which is a 34 amino acid analog of of what's called.  A parathyroid hormone-related protein. So this is you know, every hormone has a bunch of different versions and I like it. And so this is a pep polypeptide. It's based on a natural protein that stimulates one of the parathyroid hormone receptors and how so this is given intravenously or nuts x given subcutaneously and it it apparently house but the important thing about this is it's only for people with severe osteoporosis for this isn't a drug that you can take to tweak your bone density up a little bit and it is an expensive. You know, what biological molecule that is only now being investigated so stay tuned on that but it do what it does tell you if there's a really strong vested interest in improving pharmacologically this syndrome. Okay, and then there's you know, that's an old foods for osteoporosis is it turns out that boy? This is a large prospective study with 24,000 woman's going to Shanghai women's health study. So you and you have a lot of soy eating in that culture.  I'm also you have Asians are the highest, you know, osteoporosis risk, like my new mother-in-law has broken both of her legs from fractures for osteoporosis, but she is such a tough person that she has once again running 5 K's after both but some people are just more amazing than others. But this is a good example that she's Taiwanese. That's why I brought her up 100% So Prospect of studies 24,000 women over for 25 years and a cup of soy milk bottom line is soy intake reduces risk of fractures by 35% That's pretty good. You know, that's pretty good in fracture is a you know, when you get to be in their sixties or seventies having a fracture is not like having a fraction when you're a child falling off the jungle gym. It is a very difficult medical syndrome to deal with off of you don't get for healing. It's practically affect Mobility quality of life and other health things that require motility. So it's it's a thing. Okay. So let's talk a little about phosphorus and magnesium.  Get the sodium today, but that's okay. So it's involved in bone growth and maintenance. So every every moment every atom of or ion of calcium requires a phosphate to make this hydroxyapatite answer also phosphate is critical for nucleic acid synthesis in energy metabolism ATP our old friend to come and go to the tune of 70kg a day of ATP you turn over if you were to add it all up. I'm starting a sufficient answer vitamin D blood levels regulated by the kidneys. Okay. So phosphorus has a RDA of 700 mg per day. How do u l is 3 or 5 3 to 4 grams per day in again? That's because kidney function is challenged by really high amounts of of a a phosphate. So the usual intake is a 1.1 to 1.6 grand jury notice that even a cup of yogurt has quite a lot. So this is one of those cases were the natural usual intake. This is just population averages is greater than the RDA. It's not a bit.  Pul but it's interesting that just eating kind of food that we eat as a population. We're taking more more phosphate in that we need and phosphates are pretty abundant ion magnesium same kind of deal in this case magnesium is lower than the RDA. So there's plenty of foster the diet, but many many people have a mild magnesium deficiency something we don't we don't take a nap. So Rd is 400 Megs per day for men 300 Megs per day for women. The usual intake is about 350 to and so we're actually normal intake for the you know, a healthy westernized mechanize diet is below what we need. So I actually do take a magnesium supplement each day or so. I've been told that this is something that older people especially endurance hobbyist and did not have enough up and if you remember from 102 every damn reaction had magnesium under  Watch always there. So any sort of energy into ATP phosphate type thing Pollyanna and uses of magnesium often as a cofactor, especially Bosco transfer. So there's no OU well for normal food 350 milligrams per day. And if you have if you take way too much you can have these sort of things but the important thing is magnesium deficiency as you can cause mineral and cardiac problem. So magnesium is incredibly important along with calcium in excitable tissue and energy metabolism. Okay, so we're going to talk about electrolytes a little in this will be a good segue. So, you know that are constantly involved in physiology in the major events of sodium potassium hydrogen ion chloride bicarbonate inorganic ions in the interesting thing about these that you've learned in physiology as they have extremely different distributions inside a cell and outside of cells and as you know from learning  Neurotransmission that beautiful imbalance of tons of potassium inside hardly any outside and tons of sodium outside and hardly any inside is the reason you have all this fantastic excited about this is the reason we can think the reason that our heartbeats shushi million times without stopping the reason that we can move at will with our muscles. It's all about those gradients being capitalized on to do near Transmission in tissue excitation sodium. These are that the basic numbers, you know, and you probably have learned these another time he pH of tissue and that's super important. Do you know the pH of your blood and your tissue is super well control and Physiology and a lot of interesting ways by Carmen it like that. You know what I'm going to stop at 3:20 my watch History 19 and a half, but I'll let you I'll see you next week.  San Diego podcast "
