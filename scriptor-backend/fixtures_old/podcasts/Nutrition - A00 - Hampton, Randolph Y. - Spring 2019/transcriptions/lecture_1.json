    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  All right, very sorry to be late. It won't happen again lie, so I'll try not to have it happen again. Welcome to be a b c 1 2. Oh, it's great.  It's it's very confusing because bibc 102 is metabolism in this is 120. This is the culmination of metabolism. So I'm trying to get used to it and I am very thrilled to be do you see my good people? My my grandchildren is is cuz I can't see my brothers and sisters cuz you're like way too much population of deep and I'm super lucky to be a professor jobs literally in the world in a my other friends go to their work. They garnish it. I got to go to work at my kid get to go to work. So, you know, I'm a big part of that is you guys making it true and I decided I'm a research scientist and I run an active laboratory, but I've decided for the last like 5 or 6 8 10 years of my career. I'm going to focus more and more on teaching I want to ask.  The scope of things I teach I want to get better at it. And I want to I want to explore an upset of topics that are sort of the bigger picture than the ones I've been working on with my research. So and you guys are allowing me to do that. And so I am honored to be allowed to do this. So this is and I had this Vision I used to teach metabolize still teach metabolism my bibc 102 that metabolic biochemistry did everyone hates, but it's like they basically they should deck of cards at life handed us at least in terms of molecules. And so I think it's an incredibly beautiful class and it's taking me about 10 years of teaching at the store to begin to get it. I kind of get it, you know, it's a hard top again and I realized the really the way to learn something is to teach it and I saw you are sort of my guinea pigs in this good sense cuz I've never taught this course before I mean, I like you eat a lot. But but I never thought this course before and seem like a damn, you know, I'm paying good money.  What you gain from? That is my enthusiasm for teaching for the first time and I'm perfectly humble about if you ask me a question, I don't know how I'm going to find out together. We're going to invent this new wheel organ invented wheel together of understanding and thinking about nutrition and and I look upon it as bibc 102 is is the basic core core molecular events that happened in life supercritical + Xtreme conserved in all organisms are absolutely fine. And then the milk and that we talk we talk about exercise physiology and what that allow she was up slightly bigger lens to look at how those processes work in a collection of subsets a physiological processes and nutrition answer to the final explosion of all of it. Cuz everyone of us consumes and nutrients have to do it to live, you know, the organism is a constantly turning over pool of Molly molecular transformations to keep opr  Happening in and you keep the energy flowing and that's all through nutrition. So this is sort of that the final the big man move of that explosion in to 102. So it's sort of like, I think Warren and one of them is a whole year of culture. It was an entire year of sort of cultural history of the world, I guess so we can awesome course and I wish I had taken it when I was your age as I've had to osmow's most history and most literature just fly cuz I studiously avoided topics like that when I was a college students all math physics chemistry that kind of thing which I did obviously got me. Okay. I'm here. I here I am but I wish I had that this to me is sort of a year of that kind of culture Asian for molecular and health and wellness self to me. This is what my music I'm leaving. So whatever so this is the class going to do a few mechanics a few mechanics. So first of all, I invented this when I took bipn  Biology medicine exercise I decided I'd use a 4 slide system trouble even though it's the middle of the afternoon and you're all awake and this is an awesome time for but not bored yet yet. And so but is that too risky? It's like that's it. That's under genic producing sleep. Anyways, the color code for the slides up and out. So yellow is class information green is actual lexrich5. Material red is clickers and purple is fun. Cuz they try to have a little fun and then also this occasion of grey one, which is I stand corrected that I got a new color. I've had that sometimes I have to fix that and so, you know, I'm I'm perfectly happy. I think sign in one of the beautiful things about being a scientist is, you know, where a good scientist is wrong 95% of the time a brilliant.  This is wrong. 94% the time a journeyman passerby scientist is wrong 96 stark contrast to the the political sphere. We're admitting you were wrong. It's like the kiss of death, you know for us wrong means I did the experiment correctly to learn something that's been happening and I'll continue on your Thomas Edison has that very famous quote work. I guess he looked at something like eight hundred different filaments before they came up with a lipo light bulbs used to have a feeling that they get hot. If I don't even know that anymore in phones are connected to the wall and so on but the way he figured out the tungsten who knew texting is he tried this hundreds and hundreds of filament just hundreds of it and someone asked him like when he got the number 700 they say they said to do you feel bad that you had to do, you know yet another one that didn't work as though I now know another one that doesn't work. So, you know that base of information is very valuable and  You know, we're comfortable being wrong. And so my slide I stand corrected. It's just part of the Matrix of trying and getting stuff wrong in that and together. We're going to figure this out. Okay. So this is this resides. This class is podcast and slide casted. I don't do the video cuz it's just too hard to edit to distract me, but I figured this out as one of the troubles with podcasting is that it used to be  Are uses primitive device called a laser uses primitive device and I would it's not even working at the battery is dead, but it would be a good example cuz you can't see it on the podcast. You can't see the laser pointer to hear that you're over here and you just see a square. So I I got this thing has his boss or what she a boss and I don't get this you can do this to so you got a pointer but that is on the screen so you so the only trouble is highly nonlinear like me going like this makes it go that actually is working but it's it's a it's a little Darlin you're so it means I have to be a little less frenetic and look like when I face it, that's why I have no idea which way it's going to go. It's just completely crazy. So but I think it's a good trade up cuz when you watch the screen cast you will see the point in that that super valuable know you can do this cool spot light.  I got so it's a it's cool hundred bucks for you. Good people. I gladly paid out of pocket. I want to show you something else easy Racers. I bought these guys unless you're eight feet. All these erasers will kill you in school teacher supplies and brought them here and they've stayed I've noticed it's a good idea cuz they stayed here for about a half a year. So that's that's a worthwhile investment. They pay me the big bucks going to science get rich. Okay, so you can buy a razor. All right. So we're going to do some class information to talk about about class information. So first of all of the lecturers are 2 to 3:20, Tuesday Thursday, I know I started it to 10 college eyes, normally 22320 the sections are written out and you have to go to yours. They're required. Okay, we actually do some discussion touch up and we specifically want the eyes.  Learn how to teach to learn how to conduct classroom. So for them. It's incredibly formative part of what they're doing and it's actually been a lot of fun. We've we've been able to extract this. I've noticed my capes of dipped a little bit when I made the discussion section car, but I will take that hit for the value of doing it for you. Say tour 7% I can't put on the podcast. Now, it's it's okay. What was you doing? I couldn't hear it cuz he said that's why I don't do video cast. What's heat working? I couldn't see so anyway, but the I think they require discussion sections are especially in the topic light exercisers nutrition. There's a lot to discuss and it's it's very interesting and I think that will be a lot of fun to develop one final and I haven't figured out yet where the finals going to be this or that with when it's exactly what it's going to cover but I will use I'm actually using the the person who developed this class at the level I want to teach  Dad is going to Gangnam Nigel Crawford who just retired and literally a question. Yes, sir.  Do what?  Finish what I was saying.  You mean I've stopped mid-sentence.  Orange  Sorry, I'm very very nonlinear hears me in a conversation.  So like we were here and just go on bro. What are you got? What do you need?  What do you need?  Do you have if you have a question?  Okay. Alright, so where it will back to hear? Okay, so  Now I've lost my train of thought.  What are natural Crawford St. Amen? Amen? That's into him like literally a year ago and I was teaching of a freshman seminar in Sugar which is an amazingly interesting incredibly interesting topic but has no one I said dude. I ran into a sort of template of his flavor, but I'm going to add my own things about it. So that's what we're going to do. Are we going to work out a Triton Ed and I just learned today that Triton that is being replaced by something called canvas next year. He is that good or bad. It's not good. So I'm going to be a kiss. My response was what if it's any worse than screw all that stuff. I'm going to quit because  Is very crazy, but I'm finally starting to get how to do it in this Conkey way, so we'll see but but we're working on it right now and I tried to email all of you. Just you all get the email. Okay good. So it works. Okay good and that that's good. I will decide soon with the finals going to be weather is going to be cumulative or or just a second half of the class. I file figure that out. Now. Here's the thing that people have been confused by his if you look at the schedule of classes. So if you go through blank and you go to schedule classes it has where everything is and all the all the official Parts in here I use this.  Let me do this here. If you look down here and this part fun or what I can't even goes down there. Maybe we can do some karaoke.  Are you listening to protein?  Those are macronutrients. Okay. So so if you look here that there's been a lot of consternation because of these schedules here and what they are is if you blow it up it looks like those are midterm seeing people have been all concerned about when those midterms are but that's actually an accurate his wife to reserve one of the hardest things to do in this University is your reserve a room. It's much harder than getting it smarter to getting tenure difficult. So you have to use these tricks and one of them is I say we're going to have a midterm you section c  Oh, wait. Oh wait. No, it's a midterm. Cuz I know that you'd ministration monitors the podcast he was lying. Okay fire him.  So if we are so we're going to use those reviews. I should be just great cuz the other all pre schedule and that means all the eyes and Tas can go to them too, cuz they're free schedule. So we don't have to finagle you coming in on the weekends. So that's what we're going to use them for. All right, so that's so don't freak out. If you have those times for other things an interview sessions are always podcast as well. So if you can't make it to review session, there are ways to gain that information. Okay. Let's see some sections. Are you so sections you each have one you've all been assigned at 1 and they're going to start tomorrow, which reminds me I need to talk to the eyes and tears after the class just we'll get together and and and just sort of put our heads together about in the first discussion groups are going to be just a sembling. What you're going to do is you're going to form for the rest of the quarter three or four person discussion groups that you're going to work together on and solve certain problems and come up with interesting ideas. I think we might read a scientific paper.  Two together. I'm not quite sure how that's going to work. And so they value these as you develop a connection with your fellow students, you provide pooled expertise or pooled thinking ability critical thinking when you're together. It also allows the eye is in 2 days to get to know you better and that's I think that's super important like the home value of being class is this energistic ability to to gain the energy of thinking and communicating, you know, that started the value of it. I think this emphasizes that so the iata the reason why I am a TA has to be called what they are and what they are so instructional assistant ta is the right so it is what it is. So that's what I really mean.  Otherwise trouble anyway, so this year the discussion section required but for a very small amount of credit that I will determine I will tell you how much it's going to be like a teeny fraction of the total you go to all of them you earn that credit you don't it's not a big hit cuz some people don't like to do it. Some people can't so we'll figure that. It's not a big thing. Okay, we use a new tool called sequestration, which is an awful portmanteau, which is a meeting for Mentos is a word meaning of fusion of two other words, and it comes from the idea about a big piece of luggage a portmanteau is a piece of luggage go through all kinds of stuff in and it's a word that you make by putting two words together. And so this is basically it's a format of a quiz but you work on them together and everybody gets a hundred because you all feel the night together. Everybody gets a hundred and it's really just a way of promoting communication and each week. I write a couple quiz scussion questions therapy keys are put on the on the web on the Triton engine also IU  Use the quick cash in question sometimes on the exam. So there's value in it at many different. I was a most of its to get you guys to communicate with each other and solve problems. Okay. So it's it's based on a consensus basis answering of a question or to buy small discussion with witches in truly awful sentence. It's based on consensus-based. I apologize. I'm a scientist. I'm not a literary guy. Okay, so that's how we do.  So this is how to write the quiz questions look like that. You know that this is what you'll get in class something like this is one from from bibc 102 And discussing NAD plus is a lot less interesting to discussing exercising nutrition. So this is how the keys look with my chicken scroll over the iPad and apple pencil. Okay. So that's how it works and EDT the I-88 will have these keys in hand. So they'll be able to guide the discussion and and you my hope is interesting ideas will arise that. I haven't thought about that. We had fun. Okay, I have office hours. I'm in 2130 Pacific all these are all going to be slide cast. I'm going to post all the slides at the end of each lecture so you can get these with no trouble and  It's funny cuz 2130 pack all is a big room with a huge table and refrigerator in the projection screen. I think students have a little office down all the way down the other side of the house, but but but this is that it's a really nice room for discussion. And if it's anything like a discussion sections were very wide-ranging discussions about training and exercise and of course material as well and you know my feelings meaning, you know, if your son that you will come to schedule section to just come through their notebooks meal.  I like basically studying and hop up and ask you questions dude. That's okay. I mean I will be there for that hour no matter what you do with it, but but  I went 15 goes into the room and you just sat there, but it's really great. If you bring questions and I actually really enjoy questions that go beyond the range of the class things that you thought about things that interest you about this topic. I mean the cool thing about nutrition is everybody everybody has an opinion about nutritional issues this as we will learn and you'll see even today but as we will be in great detail, there's a phenomenal amount of unknowns figuring out those I know and so everybody has an opinion. I also have nutritional opinions that are not nearly as well-informed is assayed the research program my conduct and that's okay. So far one of our taxes going to be figuring out how to parse those questions and issues into in a ways to think about him ways of communicating one of the things is going to happen to all of you people.  Is as you progress through biomedical science, maybe some of you will be physician. Some of you may be assisting some of you will be administrator. Some of you will simply learn this stuff cuz it's cool, you know, whatever the more knowledge you get the more people will ask you questions, assuming, you know, everything, you know, I have friends out in the real world. I love all my many friends who aren't scientists, but you know, they think that I know as much about the Hadron Collider as I do about fatty acids cuz I'm a science guy. I don't really know but my feeling is because you will get lots of questions and it's one of the things you know, that's very valuable to figure out how to answer those questions in a responsible way to people like your folks your friends, you know, your significant others, if they're not science people people that are curious for reasons, including your profession in your career. So I think that's really great.  What is 2130 Packerland I say this is all going to be on the podcast. So we're in the middle of The Bold and ongoing experiment in which we show one of the things we use is clickers and clickers is basically a way for you to give me information from when I ask you a question, but we're also doing something that I caught collecting. It says, this is not something you should do it home. Do not do not combine this device with this device, but that's a very old-fashioned texting device, but we aren't we do texting in class, and basically what it involves is this phone number is from a text application, and it's that I paid a few bucks for it cuz it's so easy to remember so I try to keep it active all the time because he's texting applications pay a few bucks and you can choose a number from a whole scrollable number and that was an awesome number that's very easy for even me even me to remember so we've been using it all year.  And basically what happens during class at different times people can text me a question. Now the cool thing about this is a couple of his number one in a normal class when people ask questions, I say probably 10 people ask all the questions and they always sit in the front you can always make fun of them. Try to discourage I think is fantastic but it's hard. It's scary the hundred people in here I get that, you know, so if you are one asked real world questions, that's totally awesome and I will encourage that seems to happen word more as a class goes on as we develop an atmosphere of trust and concern and Karen vulnerability being. Okay. However, when you have text question and you get like hundreds of people has like one of the cool things about as you started sending Anonymous, the phone numbers are here, so, you know if you wrote are going to kill you  Your family I have your phone number. However, you know, I'm not good. I don't really care. If you ask any sort of normal even crazy question. That's okay. And so it's Sammy Anonymous and that way is very good. It also is great because either 60 fearing that you can ask a question cuz you all have your phones out. Anyways, who am I kidding so much to be everybody's got their phone if it's totally okay. And so you get am far more people asking questions during the quarter then you get and plus free to ask any questions. Like is this the same thing as when that nutrient was discovered in you know, and Brad that did this are you can ask anything you want and there's really no downside and so today.  I just have it here. But normally we will use really use a slight intermediate. So this is the question. I've been texting question. And so here let's test it. Hit me up. Yo tried. I got one here. Hey Randy miss you from biochem. That's that's touching. You need you need a life because it's very nice. I love by a okay. Hit me up. Some of those one. There's one is ketosis legit legit. Okay, no bunch of Hearts trouble me to hi professor. I was wondering if you'd be willing to hold additional office hours. Use Reddit know Randy my man. What's up do discussion section start this week? Yes, they start this week. Oh my God, this is  How is carbon carbon jar black cat in my wife and I have a black cat named carbon dust and he's the best carbon is totally awesome. It works. If one of the things I just demonstrated here is it's a massive number of text Kimberly and people want to do it. I mean, it's fun. Okay. Okay, you should incorporate carbon. I do it all the time. Every time I eat I'm incorporating carbon and nitrogen a joke, but we normally do with this texting is I have really come up with a good name for it is we have an intermediary who has the iPad and then they forward me distilled vs. Of the questions and they can also return ones that are that are you know, sort of like what room is the final in they can just write that down so it helps of which was totally cool about this. I'm very sorry about this. I've been doing this for about five or six years and I just I've actually written an academic paper on it that I too too lazy to the complete.  I have to do that, you know and what's neat is that several of the professors are studies at the Brenda Bloodgood has been using it and Carolyn Curly has been using a few people have been employing it so my help is it eventually every all the biology Professor? It's actually did you notice it's not my cell phone. So you can't call me in the morning at my phone. So it's really. I just I'm really thrilled about it. It's really great. Okay, so so so just like in texting there are common acronyms in texting and so some of them are LMAO. What the f are you saying? That's really common in a class. Can I have an A?  If I don't get an A my life is over with this is actually Italian exactly. Oh now it's those are all reasonable things to do. There is only one thing. I don't want you to find these are fun cuz it's fun purple fun. Okay, but there is seriously one thing I do not want you to text a free country can text me anything you like, but I would appreciate it. If you don't is that going to be on the test? And the reason that you don't need to do that is cuz we go to Great Lengths to tell you exactly what's going to be on the test. Cuz I realize these classes like metabolic exercises are riddled with information is their language classes, you're learning a language, you know in the language exercise. I think we had 200 terms that were new and it in in metabolic. I think it's 300 terms. It's a substantial.  Vocabulary that will serve you for your entire career whatever it is you end up doing so I am aware of that and so each each week. I have a study list and a a a a a a study listen to terms list that I will update and if you've taken classes before I think this is really important to do and I try to be very Vigilant I came up with it because if you do that in the test, I promise you you will know it's going to be in the chest. It is my solemn vow to you. So you don't need to ask every 8 minutes and I get to be concerned about I am not disparaging your interest in that fact. I'm just asking you to not explore your interest in this manner 4K It's All About Love My People. Okay. So normally we have what we call a text message to General does someone who has the a device like this and they received the primer with and then send them to my cell phone so I can just easily see what's going.  It cuz one of the troubles is a text as you all know, probably better than I do texting is by user. That's why you might accidentally send the wrong thing to the wrong person have terrible social problems. I can't make it tonight what you just said you were coming over his house, but this is by user. So if people intersperse or interlaced questions, you can't it's is great cuz they're all in temporal order and somebody some some if somebody out there is some sort of app hacker or writes apps come see me because it would be awesome to develop a little project but we make an app that temporalize is the input and send it out in a separate stream Google text. Does it work? Cuz every number Google text sent out to a different new number has not helped you out why that is I'm not sure. Okay, so that's what we do. So  Another frequent Outreach modality. That super important is just email one of the good things about Triton Ed is that bass very easy to email the entire class including including in a waiting list people in den den den dad on young students that kind of thing. So I use that a lot. I'm not a huge fan. I don't do a lot of interfacing but I do think that's really great. So the trick is you have to check your UCSD account, you know many people use to email or whatever which is I totally get but figure out a way to be checking your UCSD account. If you if you want to get all the misses that I salmon on flood the market with them, but they are out there and it's useful and you can feel free to email me. The trouble is email is a noisy channel. The signal-to-noise ratio of email is progressively lower and if I miss emails all the time even embarrassing emails like from Grand administrator,  I just got the lab. It is but a subject you know, hey, you're amazing. I'm doing it. No, that was actually good subject line is useful. Like, you know, I like this is the most amazing class in class. We also be using clickers and you're all familiar with this and I think this is a great channel of communication. Do I I'm I'm not 100% convinced that clickers aren't really about just everyone taking the 7th inning stretch, like just getting to take out their pack and do some stuff and pets around the device and talk to their friends and take a breather. Whatever the effect. It seems to really help the rhythm of the class cuz we get back to it. You know, people are a little refreshed and there are there is Value Inn in finding out what you know, but you don't know.  Maybe even exchanging information with each other eventually clickers are going to be incorporated into phones because having to bring a little device around is is so 1990s. You know that it's just that it's only a matter that was before you were around but in the 90s we have little devices for everything. Okay. In fact, let's do a little quick attach. So this says AC but I believe it's actually a a and I don't know what that's about unless we're a bunch of Alcoholics. I don't really know. So I think that the actual frequency is a ace anybody want to  Tell me that is it AA. My name is Randy.  Okay. Well then I guess it's I think they automatically find a frequency. The fancier ones. I love about clickers is it is again a pretty Anonymous way to just ask questions about what kind of a group is here. So these are all purely questions out of curiosity and interest about the subject not about the date of the subject. So first of all, pure curiosity I am taken Hampton both 108 a metabolic with Hampton. This is an okay, whatever so quick away.  I can even make it a little easier you can anonymously  And no one can see what?  Oh, okay. Magdy metabolic, but not exercise. Sorry gunpoint. Forget the silly joke Diaz. Good point is that possible is metabolic.  But not exit. Why don't you take one away and 40 people in that team called the 108 if I even made a latex band check it out when a waiter. So it's it's going to be great and everyone so I'm going to be sleeping in the garage for a couple months.  Okay, stop.  Where is everybody? Okay, let's see. This one.  Northern classes so we got okay. So the lot of this is not redundant and we have few see is both of these are Randy Hampton survivors. Okay. So so we're going to have a party that the people have taken all three we're going to we're going to do something fun and I will give you each a little Medallion like celebrating nine months sober and grab that. Hold on. I'm grabbing.  Okay, good next tape your curiosity.  I know how many calories I eat a day.  damn, that's  I'm curious. This is something I'm in very germane very relevant to nutrition.  Did I do something wrong did something bad happen?  Are you checking your like bar?  Add sandwich probably 400 calories right there 3:30.  All right.  Come on, you other twenty-three people. Don't be shy.  You're checking your rappers.  All right. It seems it's funny cuz there was like 3:33 or 3:13.  Okay, they probably put their friends Quakers. Don't forget it. I'm not going to cheat any longer. Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Most people do not know. How many calories is it a that is wheat and tourism that's very interesting. Okay, that's and the older you get the more you end up in this category. So that's cool. That's actually super super interesting going to grab that one to grab the whole screen. Okay good.  I actually compute how many calories I eat a day like calculate then. I'm just getting to some going to be a pretty small number because most people don't so it'll be a large number of responses, but I presume is a very small number of people.  Is that Sim work?  And we're going to change that.  Hey, what do we have rebellious people like I refuse to answer that.  if a clicker  All right.  Come on.  There's two left.  You can click secretly under your desk.  I don't have a clicker.  Okay. Alright. I was welcome.  15 holy crap, you found your friends other two quick is your back supposed to do this.  Okay. All right ready?  It's so easy even smaller number actually compute.  So any idea what is going on in this? There's no.  That's all I can.  All right, that's a whole lecture. This is a minor disaster.  Okay.  Lord have mercy I normally not quite this incompetent like dude, you're going to need 10 years to figure this shit out. Okay, so I see you're deep in the middle of our clickit. Okay? Okay. That was it. You go away now.  Okay couple more.  the best description of my eating is  Omnivore I eat anyting vegetarian vegan ketogenic.  And a medically regulated diet. Some of you might be on diet should have been designed by a physician or something. I'm just curious not evaluated.  Are you might be on a diet that's been prescribed for some situation purely curious?  the number to pour in in  and some of these like you could be a ketogenic vegan, but it's probably was the Venn diagram and that's going to be pretty small.  not worried  You can't be an omnivore vegan.  Oreo light you just a liar then you know  Okay enough plenty of curiosity has plenty.  Almost all just omnivores which makes sense, you know adjusting diet is something that people should have gradually drift 2. Is he at War and more worried about dying? So it's something I've noticed in my prayer group is very much involved in adjusting a thing about their diet. That's pretty good omnivore and we're going to explore what these different diets me and how they affect now I bet you in the Iron Mask was the exercise coach, but I bet you there's a lot more people who in that class cuz I'm about half the people that crossed trained did exercise regularly, so I'll bet you a bunch of those for ketogenic. What do we see? How many were keto just got to take my glasses off here?  For so those four people on that ketogenic diet interesting very interesting. Very basic biochemistry is behind that really interesting balance between lipid metabolism in Krebs cycle loading and it's actually pretty pretty cool. Metabolically pretty interesting. I exercise regularly.  Shannon  there won't be a team or not going to be nutrition team that we got like a hot dog eating contest team.  The irregularly is not a value judgment. Like I don't mean like a regular motions. I mean like frequently.  on a regular basis  All right.  And that's plenty that would give us our averages.  Nice over half the people exercise regularly that makes me very happy. If you're in the red quad and it's red cuz you're annoying in quadrant. I would suggest trying to move to the blue quadrant. I'd say one of the best things I ever did. You know, I make lots of stupid decisions and then later realize they were like that was a bad idea. So I will say one of the best and sometimes I make good decisions. I didn't realize you're getting I've gone to rest and that was a good idea. So I started running about 36 years ago just to get away and I started running Anna and I really didn't know a damn thing about it. I just felt like doing it and it's on there was none of this Born to Run or these Praises are all this stuff but it is one of the smartest accidentally smartest things I've ever done and I'm super super guide me. I'm going to run the Fargo Marathon one of the weekends in this class. So you mail get an A from the deathclaws if I die everyone gets an a  Marathon near is  and you can tell your exercise. Is he regular me?  Tragic loss of Professor create strange within the statistics of grading. Okay, so all right there anymore. I am taking this class. That would be you not me. I'm taking this class for personal interest or career path reasons for both prophets. Notoriously Easy Grader weight. This is an econ. I know it's an old joke and flogged the joke.  Okay.  We're almost done and then we'll get to some actual stuff about nutrition.  Okay, and it stopped but I think this is really great to get to know you guys a little bit.  Okay, I'm going to let that last few people. Come on.  That's passing that's called passive aggressive go look it up, which is passive aggressive for me to say that like just look it up. Okay stopping.  See both A&B. Well, we'll see.  I'm actually very much. I think these guys should be about encouragement and not discouraged but that is my philosophy on this and they can't fire me. Okay. All right. Now there's a couple of the things so the textbook for this class is that interest you might not be Surprises with like a billion nutrition textbook. This is actually going to this the one that did Nigel recommended and he's really given this class A lot of others kind of cool. I was an airplane like 10 years ago and I end up sitting there since we're both going to go to some sky and sea meetings. We sat next to each other and I said what you been up to me cuz I'm done working out a new version the nutrition classes.  We chatted for the rest of the plane flight. And so I know he's given this a lot of thought and so this is a bookie really likes and I actually I just got it recently. Here's the thing about these textbooks is it's not required. It's not require me to go back but it's really useful reading. It's actually a great book it in terms of the density like no textbook you can cover in one class or just to dance but there's a lot of great stuff in it. And this was particularly nice cuz if you look here if you look here  I'm still learning. I'll be there if you look in this sector here, it says updated with that 2015 to 2020 dietary guidelines guidelines for this current time in and they change all the time when the science of nutrition is so complicated that findings change and come and go all the time. It's really a consensus facetite learning but this book is really quite good. I've been reading it in the past few months and it's really has some I've learned a lot from it beautiful diagrams at the trouble is that it's not required in purchasing one of these text books about I think the Kindle version $200 to purchase. It's probably a bit more but we're going to get some copies in the library and then you can also rent a version from Amazon for like 40 bucks. That's so bad considering how much your college education cost even at this very very good deal of a state school. But and then I saw I know you have wasted.  I got in text me like I'm downloading the textbook now.  Why don't you know it sucks and I will say this that is involved in writing any book. Especially an elder careers are curating at textbook just all the time. That's what they do. So before you grab a purloined and illegal copy of a text with you remember that hundreds and hundreds of people have work super hard to make that book is just throwing it out there. We're all flying creatures plus you have no money and pretty useful book. It's great. It's not required for class. The readings are suggested and we will I will go to Every linked I can to make the books available for people to buy the library elections are a source of your lectures are a source of your relevant and by that, I mean testable info like I do get that, you know, people want to read the tests and I know it so  And so the electrons are sources that there's podcast and also screencaps. Like I said, the lecture sides will be posted after each lecture soon thereafter and there's going to be a terms listen to study list that I will create a weekly. So after Thursday class, I will set up a terms this and say less in my feeling is been in the last two classes. I taught in this I feel is right now it is you can not do badly in this class if you know everything on the study listen to terms, but it's really sort of engineer to be that and not surprisingly when I written exam. I print out the terms. Okay that that's so it's not like that's awesome know what I held you responsible for so it's less arbitrary. Okay. So let's talk about nutrition like what is nutrition so we did this in the last class with what is exercise. What is nutrition when you use a teaching role you wait 5 seconds for people start answering  In fact, turn the lights down low. It's less scary. Hold on what is nutrition and this is like Derby off. We don't want that. It won't go off. They I guess it's like it again safety what is nutrition and want to throw it out there?  somebody gotta  Cara  I got all day watch I got till 3:20, but  anybody want Adventure?  Awake maybe maybe someone hit me up.  Will you be able to post the iata is okay, but yes, sir.  What provides the energy and functionality for a living system?  I like it. That's great the energy and functionality for a living system. Okay, and that that is like when people say you need nutrition like if the next person and what about nutrition when we talked about it as a Fields. What is Spike when someone says I'm a nutritionist in that doesn't mean they're just eating but that is definitely a beautiful part. And that's the name that the first definition is exactly that I was sad. But anybody want a sort of pushed further what is nutrition when we think about it like this class, you know, they don't do you go to that class and just eat what is it?  Okay, have a nice guy funny hand move. Okay.  Oh, there is a backup. Yes.  Awareness what you put in your body, I like that awareness.  I do that James Cook thing awareness.  He's one of those inverted classroom guys awareness.  anything else  Burn it out.  The metabolic and physiological processes occur when someone consumes food. Okay process. He's wearing his prophecies.  Including like metabolic physiologic. I like that too.  What else?  The crazy see the crazy because nutrition is a lot of things. Yes.  An energy maintenance maintenance or a different version of the first I'd like that too is you know the molecules.  now when you go to a nutritionist  But the first thing they want to know when you sit down and talk to one. What do they want to know?  What you're eating and they might even want to know something else.  Why you're eating at what motivates you so there's also like exactly is what you're eating is a behavioral. There's a behavioral aspects to  And then there's more to so the science of nutrition is in the what I like about this till discussion that we've had is that it really everyone has has had great and accurate ideas and they're just really varied and it's very cool. So nutrition is the science and interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance growth reproduction health and disease of an organism includes food intake absorption assimilation biosynthesis catabolism in excretion, and I think this is actually a limited definition cuz it also in terms of what you're going to be thinking about this either health professionals are just very awake metabolist is going to be thinking about what motivates you to eat what stimulates appetite what causes people to / new / assimilate different nutrients. You know what I mean? It's funny because the old school like the early in the early days of people understanding this is a science. It was all about what was missing.  You know telegra beriberi scurvy. Those are all very extreme cases of something missing, but now we live in an age and I'll talk about this more work. We have over over amping of nutrition in very grave consequences that are much harder to understand so and we want to understand both of those aspects of it. So nutrition science, which is larger a dietary concerns and health issues surrounding food eating and medicine is a multi-faceted field. This is where is the nutrition science chemistry biology the social sciences in nutrition science also includes the study of behaviors and social factors related to food choices. I mean, this isn't readily interesting, you know, how incredibly interesting I'm part of it. So there's actually a passage in the book that makes the point that  the most  people United States went gladly eat a steak and their cultures are eating a cat would be like the worst thing you could do. There are cultures were insects are considered a great source of protein. If you go to someone's house or go ahead or hear some crickets. I know an entomologist to host a barbecue each year at his at his academic where they cook nothing but insects and I'll look bad students. These roaches are great, but it's something that would be completely a baron and and reprehensible might somebody else. I find incredibly comfortable to eat. You know, I'm there are certain animals that is where you know, we would never do that invasive vs. That's very interesting thing about it. So the high-level behavior and psychological aspects are critical.  Teaching assistants in her room and into every aspect of life it is, you know, I didn't realize this till I read this a few weeks ago. But each of us will eat about 60 tons of food served at 70,000 meals and countless snacks that is like a constant thing we're doing for the reasons that we heard words using the molecules to provide the raw material for you know, for real repair construction and growth and for energy and one of the things I want you to realize it's actually sort of become clear in the last like 10 years is it used to be young people? Just thought that basically I'm so single cell a fertilized egg zygote and it multiplies a whole maintain see maintains the machine repairs, but the truth of the matter is that you are turning over meaning completely replacing every molecule in your body on a yearly basis every single entire mask is replaced.  About once a year and we need to be magical. I wish I could be like 93% because we start gaining weight as we get older but the truth isn't there's a constant turnover and replacement of the cereals that when that goes awry you start getting a bunch of syndromes like cancers and stuff worthy replacement isn't quite balance by the by the lawsuits over balance or something like that. So, you know, there's a there's a constant Dynamic and it's a critical part of life is the continuous taking in breaking down using of these molecules for energy and part replacement. The thing is interested in this, you know, if I'm going to shape this course at all, it's going to have much more to do with a sort of modern food chain, but we will talk about we will talk definitely about all the basic, you know, they were the macronutrients Heather metabolized what the importance of them are how the micronutrients in her play with that and then some of the really interesting questions that come from both Under and Over feeding.  But our response to food has been shaped by about a million years of evolution, you know in this is something that's actually emerging and sort of the popular literature the pods beer the paleo diet. These are interesting idea is that you know our Evolution as metabolizing and nutrient seeking organisms is a million years old. How do we grow Great Big Brainz from over a million years ago to about fourteen thousand years ago, when we invented the weapons to hunt those animals. We were eating protein in gobs for about a half an hour over a half a million years before we have the weapons to hunt those animals. So it's maybe we're just like like Yak Whispers actually endurance running is probably what we evolved animals, but that's a whole other conversation and we're going to talk about hear the trouble is that our response to food has been shaped by a million years of evolution, but our food supply our food supply is drastically  Pain in the past hundred years our food supply has a completely different thing than it was a hundred years ago. I'll give you one teeny example is it used to be that the wealthiest people on the planet would eat maybe a pound of sugar a year and it would keep it in a lock box like a jewelry box is it was so precious? Okay nowadays, the average person needs to be in 50 and 100 lb of sugar a year and that's happened in the last 50 years. It is incredible. It is I would say almost a nutria Thai nutritional catastrophe that were experiencing now.  Sugar is table sugar sucrose people don't like structures cuz it sounds too much like the F-word even though the Brits say frocto so sorry, but but it's it's glucose and fructose combine and that was what was locked in boxes to the tune of a pound or half a pound a year. And again, this is a separate conversation. They talk about more in the carbohydrate section, but there's an incredibly fascinating and brutal history of that ramping up from half a pound of year to a hundred pounds a year that involves a lot of really interesting socio culture important, socio-cultural understandings about power colonialism the kinds of things that that culture and students learned about very interesting but here we are now with sugar  And everybody's eating about a hundred times or more as much as any kind of evolutionary program ever thought to have I mean sugar tastes great because finding it was a rare thing that was super helpful to our survival. Okay. So the reason that were interested in it as a sort of biomedical can make as many of you are fun to be Physicians or be in the biomedical world or do biomedical research and it's a wonderful engine interface of you know, basic science and and practical applicability. Is that for centuries for Millennia we've done this is Hippocrates himself the Hippocratic Oath first Do no harm second serve dinner is let food be thy medicine medicine shall be thy food, which I know sounds like some kind of Hallmark card for a for a meal invitation, but it's actually the simple idea that that what we not only is not only you know, we we are what we eat, but our health is dependent upon what we eating. We're going to explore that priests.  Here so interesting thing is and I got a little bit just a little chart of diseases are impacted by Daya and the importance of two important things to realize I can so I can use this cuz it'll be on that yet is the biggest sectors the two biggest factors are cancer and diseases of the Heartland cardiovascular disease what not are the two biggest factors are strong advice only see this ass just hold on. I know what to do. Seeing the asterisk are right there. He's at this is not a great job of the asteroid which I guess is the plural of asterisk really the asterisks are the things that are impacted by diet and the important point is that cancer heart disease, which is a good half of this sector in the major diseases that we have are both strongly impacted by diet. And then this is a little aside though. I will just I will add that is this acai you see this?  It says this is accidents and adverse effects. And the something you need to know is most of that is Hospital error. So the third and this is a hyperlink off of the class. This isn't directly related to nutrition. But the third highest cause of death in the western world is Hospital mistakes is medical error and it is not a small call. Mike is going to be some low back Runner. It's not it's on the same order of magnitude same numbers. It is a major problem in in healthcare, you know now because more people go to hospital for brother. There's just the complexity of delivering Medical Care is is been challenged. We don't know but so this is the but that's a side thing to major thing. Is that a lot of these diseases including his diabetes Alzheimer's disease even has dietary components.  Kidney disease not that shocking chronic liver disease is alcohol related. We're going to include alcohol is something to talk about although it's not technically it is energy source that is usable Fuel and it's so interesting in terms of our nutritional and dietary habits will have a lecture on alcohol and I can maybe I don't know microbrew Amor graphic picture but it affects both both genders both biological genders and it's just a whole bunch of different syndromes that are affected by by diet. So we have caffeine. Although I'm a big fan causes stress with cataracts gardein. So some of these are these can be advantageous and we're going to talk about how are we having certain cancers that are increased by alcohol? We have hypertension to affected by salt salt is a huge issue that we'll talk about a lonely. I'm just I'm not going to go down the hole  Lots of really major syndromes that are affected either adversely or positively by diet. So, you know, one of the questions is how do we know that? How do we know all that? So oh I already had this. Sorry. I'm so I I was reviewing this idea that our response to food has been shaped by a million Evolution, but the food supply has drastically changed. I think they're really way to get at this if you're on the way to get at this is to read these two books. Now, I say this in my other classes as I know you all have like a ton of things to read and recommending books you might see with these two books really basically deal with the industrialization. And I mean that in the biggest sense of the word, we're checking multibillion-dollar, you know. Hundreds of billions of dollar Industries are just a business that involve the industrialization of the restaurant world. This is an older looking for I heard of this book Fast Food Nation some very famous book and then a more recent one.  At about seven or eight years ago called salt sugar fat about the sort of manufacturing grocery industry. And these two these two books describe the absolute complete usurpation of the food supply by a collection of process is it all makes sense individually running a successful business Capital share what we have in abundance, but you know, I'm not Andy business until I come from a family of accountants. I like the black sheep scientist. So we make him so so but you know, it is a very in these books are fascinating and if you're going to be in any sort of capacity of Health delivery or Wellness delivery that really worth reading are fascinating books. And the main thing is they tap into a very particular part of eating. So this is actually kind of the III.  Hours for the dorky picture. I wanted to get a picture of myself in there eating something but I didn't have time to do it. So but this is this is a actually just a description of the kinds of things that affect food choice and when I want you to sing you can look at this. This is social needs social network food customs and culture food cost education routines and habits lifestyle and beliefs like these things are very separately related to needing fuel to replace Parts in to run the machine which are all super important and what they really divided into or two major aspects when is hunger and the others appetite so hungry is this is is in some of the beautiful definitions. We got that have to do with these kind of process using molecule super important are about Hunger about needing to supply that food and you know, the truth of the matter is and we talked about this another classes to is that if you have enough water and minerals you can survive about 30 days without eating anything, you know, just from this.  Stories that you haven't talked about that more but appetite is primary psychological it's funny cuz it's this definition which I grabbed from the textbook and psychological parentheses external but I don't really think that's true. There's psychological processes are can be very internal also there just to state from the metabolic effects of of true hunger and psychology can affect hungry ever feel bad. I want to eat about a box of brownies ever feel really good not need to focus on something industrial concerns are entirely focused on appetite stimulating and improving the response that happens at the level of appetite and the most amazing. The first chapter of that book salt sugar fat has an actual documented meeting between the number of of large-scale food Executives who got together a surprising number of years ago and had a prior.  Conference wondering if they were causing a change in global health because of what they were doing. It's amazing chapter and very unlikely fascinating. I will also say this how many of you heard of fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging and it's just incredibly cool fairly nascent protocol where you can put people in a tomography scan with the right Isotopes and you can see how much glucose in different sections of the brain are using how much activity is going on in the brain and these food companies are deeply involved in using fmri to understand the right mix of things that cause reward it's comparable to things like a shot of cocaine. So it is absolutely a major part of understanding of these foods go. Okay, so there's a set this types of nutrients or question.  Why is sugar more addicting than it's probably not more addicting than cocaine. It's just a highly rewarding substance and it is very easy for people like it's very easy for people to have aberrant responses to reward pathway stimulating molecules. It is probably a little too simplistic because they're just very different things are both happen to reward Pathway to me sugar makes a lot of sense because it is so incredibly valuable to have a desire to eat those molecules, especially, you know, when getting sugar involve digging up a tuber at the risk of getting credited reward capabilities of these molecules being affected by their intense availability. That is the sort of Perfect Storm were talking about so this is one of the basic nutrients and we're going to be talking a lot about these so it turns out there's really two types of nutrients there are  Nutrients and micronutrients there is carbohydrates and we're going to have sex in lipids. There is proteins amino acids. And then there are these micronutrients and number of vitamins minerals and could I love this? There's some questionable mineral season ones that live on the wrong side of the Periodic Chart is so complex that there are people who disagree whether these minerals are important to Consumer not so at this stage 20 2019. We still don't really know all that and then of course there's water which is absolutely critical for what we do is organism. So we have carbohydrates proteins and lipids are there nude in large amounts that provide the energy that we talked about along with parts and they're called macronutrients and it's basically because you have to eat, you know ounces of them daily wear as micronutrients like vitamins and minerals you have many of them. You have to consume where you are or there's trouble sometimes very grave.  But you we have to eat milligrams of those, you know, a few hundred mg or grams of those are fine and some of them are much less than that micrograms. Okay, and here's my promise to you in the half of you have been taking the classes you before and welcome great to meet you. I will not go past the time of the class and you will not Russell before the time in the class ends. If you don't rush I won't go late. That's our deal. No wrestling. No going late. That's are that's are quid pro quo. Okay by rustling. I mean the movement of PacSun backpacks and jackets and stuff. They create the rustling sound. It's very distracting to all so here's the thing though that if you just look at that little nutrient chart entirely on a potato it's this is interesting that potatoes survive provides everything a human being need to live but not very well, but it turns out that one of the things is clear from the actual.  Chain that we evolved to consume and we are highly omnivorous we can eat lots of different diets of our bodies are very good at processing different kinds of diets really good is there's two kinds of chemicals are called phytochemicals are zoochemicals and these are just many of the micronutrients in our organisms that are not essential but definitely affect many aspects of physiology. Okay. So phytochemicals are physiologically active compounds are not considered essential nutrients, but they have clear health effects. And so here's the trouble with phytochemicals Chivas cup of coffee. There are a thousand molecules in a cup of coffee a thousand known molecules in a single cup of coffee. No wonder they're so big know where there is a venti. It's amazing. So the trouble with this is that any sort of natural source like food or or animal involvement in a blizzard.  Different molecules in one of the tasks is figuring out which ones are important and which ones are not and was kind of cool is we're starting to realize that these are the phytochemical that are currently being studied in studies funded by the NIH and other organizations and we don't have to go over all of these but there's a large number of things. None of these are on that essential nutrients chart, but they're all things that may have a have useful value for health like mono terpenes catch basins. Lignans phytosterols Caesar. There's a whole bunch of these and I have a friend in Oklahoma Grant to study the stuff in broccoli. That's Health cause and he actually got it and it's very it's a very interesting work. So, you know, there's a whole lot of these things so many such. Okay, I think I'm past you didn't Russell. I will continue this on Thursday.  It was something in broccoli a friend of Freddy.  Yeah, I think that's what they're called.  UC San Diego podcast "
