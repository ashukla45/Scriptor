I'm learning so much just from getting this together at a Breakneck pace. So that's great. I think we're all going to learn a lot together. We're doing our texts questioning. I've already gotten a couple in there. So amusing ones here. Let's see I've got do we have to go to the sketch and text me sign up for if it all possible after you signed up for it, but we would like you to go if you can if you have undue hardship, no, can we get pictures of your cat? Hold on?  Hey, bro, can you put the to email? And yeah, I got it be raining Sunday rock and roll rock and roll half do clicker questions count they do at in a small way and I will make that clear next lecture. I promised turn up the mic, please stop I said, I just happens this happens every time. Alright, that's enough for that. Turn up the mic feedback. See this is the drawback feedbacks the drawback. Right, right.  You guys all say that like 20 different ways ready?  Can you post a grade breakdown? Yeah, I will break down right there. Okay, so we have those things are artificial sweeteners bad. That's a complex and very interesting question. Sugar is really bad artificial sweeteners, maybe bad. So we'll see. So here's some popular text. Hey Randy. Just wondering if you will be uploading Electra size tire lecture. Hey Randy are the light resides going to be posted online. Can you post a PDF to slides before class? And the answer is yes. I actually was rolling to do this, but then I had to interview this fancy MD PhD students who might come here and that is awesomely fun. But it put a big slice in my morning. And so I was very late. I posted these These are now posted. I'll give you a minute to download. So if you go to Triton Ed that now have posted lectures for the coming lectures. I did this like an hour ago and emailed you and so you can download PDF  Turn on your tablet or look at the power points are give the power points at home. And you go home to do your laundry to impress your friends. Whatever. I'm so you can have both of us. And what I will do is convert these posted went. Well. I can do this all the time how to convert these posted ones into the actual delivered talk. So, you know cuz color items and whatnot. So what we'll end up at the end of the day will be the delivered things that someone else asked could we have the TA in discussion section information that's now available also. So these are printouts of the of the all the t a r i a t a s phone number on a phone number. So emails office hours. Each ta also is having a private office hours somewhere. They pretty cool place like coffee card price Center. So each one has an office hour plus tips and email so you can contact them if you need to.  And also the discussion sections are listed are where they are and who's who's directing that man. We've already done the Wednesday ones. I know you got your first taste of a quiz scussion. All this discussion is more about you and your needs not about nutritional items in nutrition is just so but that's the basic flavor. That's what they're going to be about. Okay.  Another popular text, you're way too young for us to be our grandchildren. I beg to differ OK Suisun math. I am 64. So, here's my birth.  That's supposing I didn't do this at age 22. I had a child. That's very common. Hey, then that child grow to be 22 and had a child and then that child grew to be you and your 18 to 22.  20 40 60  So yeah, I am I Uncharted tell you I am old enough to be your grandchildren and your grandfather.  I'm immature enough to be your grandchildren, but old enough to be your grand parents. So that's why I say my grandkids because it seems more age-appropriate number. So, okay. So many people wanted to see carbon the cat that's carbon and that he's in the carbon area. This is his niche of the house in Ocean View. It's the world's best cat and I discovered I bought this webcam to watch him when we first got him and I discovered I really only need you to still camera cuz he sleeps like 20 hours a day. Like literally he sleeps constantly. This is why he's up waking us up at 3 in the morning. I can't come over to do something. He found out recently that ferrets sleep 22 hours a day and he was all like fresh bulshit man. They are lazy 20 hours. I'm good to go. I got shit to do anyway.  Sections in you you each have a section they started yesterday. So a bunch of you went to sections this discussion group base, you're going to formal discussion group three or four people usually something like that and that's going to be your discussion group for the rest of the time. You're going to work out problems discuss things fun to know each other watch each other Rise through the ranks of biomedical science to become powerful people in 20 years lost the charger and you'll develop a connection with your classmates in your iata. So that's and you will mow over interesting problems in nutrition from class and other sources to so that's the hope  I lived I lived to tell the tale actually worked on stuff. I had my computer there, but you are welcome to come. I don't bring questions or don't come I guess you didn't have time. You can come for any reason whatsoever. And I really like to meet people in they casual of the Casual environment of the of this room. We sit in but no one came yesterday, which is okay. I get it got your stuff to do sleeping 20 hours a day. So that's fine. So, but I'm there 3 to 4 and maybe 3 to 4 hours and so good. I guess we can click that because I thought perhaps just everyone's got things to do at 3 to 4. So I'll ask you that little later.  Okay. So the textbook were using for the classes This Is War laws for sex practice and nutrition I get a lot of the figures from this it's it's very good book. It's full of a lot of interest very current. They have guidelines for 2020 even so it's pretty up-to-date and you might not be surprised to hear this but there are a huge number of nutrition textbook nutrition books nutrition sources is a really great videos that will that I'll make you aware of that are from different websites is a huge she would government presents in nutritional analysis to there's a lot of resources dedicated to trying to figure out what good nutrition is both for legal and Regulatory reasons was also just for reasons of good interface between science and health, you know, it's a it's a it's a very healthy usage of science buying tax dollars in even talk a little bit about that today. Okay, so we were talking about we were talking about  I'm going to try something else also want to try it. I did it last snow human could use you need to be like an angry Hulk.  Okay, I'm going to do this I think is going to be cool. I'm not quite tall enough to be your grandfather now, but I've been doing this. I started this last quarter. This is a texting number you all know that and I just make a little terms Corral and I put the terms that we talked about in here. So we talked about phytochemicals.  And those are things a variety of nutrition-related things that come from plants Fido means plant-like Fido Club. The first rule of Fight Club is don't say your a plant and then we have Zoo chemicals.  Which come from animals in zoos the San Diego Zoo and they come from from animals. So a good example of one of these is you know, like seafood Amelia fatty acids are used to make the essential multi desaturate. If he's omega-3 fatty acids that we'll talk about it length, then get them fish and krill and other things that are very very good for one's lipid balance. I'm so that's good example of that in this is just a collection of these a bunch of these phytochemicals that are under study. So there are thousands of phytochemicals. I mentioned last last Tuesday is that is that in a single cup of coffee this a thousand different molecules a thousand. It's unbelievable how complicated things that are natural are and you know, one of the interesting things we don't know is to what?  Extant are nutrients that come from sources that basically are natural see when people say natural that we're going to try to parse with that really means cuz usually a molecule that comes from a plant is pretty much identical to the molecule if it's a small molecule that a chemist makes that you making a test tube there really structurally identical and leave the laws of quantum mechanics. Tell us they have to be the same in very poor man way. However, when you extract something like, you know a vitamin from a plant you're getting a whole bunch of you're one of the things that's really interesting about the difference between natural food sources in process food sources is the changing and loss of this vast blizzard of different small molecules that might be of use to us when we're trying to figure that out and what you start hearing as people say, well I only take Vitamin C from rose hips and you got to say  Are there other stuff in there or you just feel better about taking it and it makes you do better and all of those all of those are important, you know, one of it isn't this is a little bit of a hyperlink. But but one of the things it's super important in nutrition and exercise is because you know a 10% benefit or a 5% benefits of real thing that's really in the range of what we call the placebo effect and I'm not even against I don't like the word placebo effect because I think it has it cast and negative Pony idea that we in weird nonlinear ways can participate in the outcome of things. We do, you know, if you believe that you're a exercise regiment is going to make you better you probably will perform better food. It's a little more interesting question. You know, he's there if you believe you're taking some nutrient that makes you feel better more energized you may well feel more energized. So let mr. Crazy study. This is a little bit of a hyperlink, but I just think you'd love to hear the Sarah studies now where they have observed the placebo effect when they tell the people at  Placebo that is actually documented statistically significant differences and you are getting it and they still show a quantitative measurable differences between not getting it which to me is just amazing. So I guess we all want to do that. So these kinds of things are bundled up in this issue, but these are just the zoo chemicals in phytochemicals that are being studied. So now they're mainstream ones. I like them some of the vitamins we talked about those come from plant sources many of them but these are things that are a more obscure. They're not considered nutrients in the sense that you need them to survive but they might have all kinds of benefits. So there's a number of people study these in many labs and it's a really interesting idea. Another place is super important is the supplement industry and we've talked a little bit about this lasted in exercise class, but supplements are an incredibly interesting and pretend  Movie problematic source of fito and zoochemicals because they're almost totally unregulated in their unregulated in this way is drugs. Now, I don't know how much you know about this and you could teach a whole class about Farnham the Pharma pipeline meaning the pipeline from basic Discovery Target identification science to the clinic and giving a drug December and you know, it's a long road I've done this before but if you did, this is the research part, but say it's 1 to 10 million dollars. If you have a million bucks, you can run a very substantial research effort if ten million bucks, you can run a very major research effort for a few years. It takes about a million half a million bucks a year to run a small lab that's about right. If you want to take that cool idea and develop it into a drug including having a chart of how about that works over here. It's about a billion dollars from all the phase testing phase 1 2 3 and other phasing and I'm not an expert on that.  And the reason is it drugs have to be shown to be safe and had to be proven innocent. They are guilty until proven innocent. So Phase 1 trials are basically is anything bad going to happen. If a human takes it that's All Phase One trials tell and I'll do it a lot. So it's all about negating the idea that that are providing evidence that they're not bad supplements. This is a name and it's purely physical and Commercial. These are laws that got passed about supplements because they are from plant matter Austin from edible things. So they know they're less suspect like for instance still be is this compound supposed to promote longevity to come some blueberries blue-berries blueberries the best proof. I have that God exists such a beautiful little tasty round awesome thing and  I don't mean that in any denomination always early secador statement, whatever you want to whatever you want. But anyway, okay, how bad can I be but when you get a chance to read measure the size calculator this a couple days ago for fun. It's about a hundred kg of blueberries worth of there still being in a capsule. It's just a crap load of it. So who knows? You know, what if someone 890 kg of blueberries that you have to prove demonstrate their bad before they get taken off the market. So they're put on the market so nice of the tunes of thousands or millions of people taking them before and he the best example I had that I talked about the expense causes. There is a an exercise supplement called craze and craze has in it a synthetic methamphetamine analog  Exercise all night if that's a whole other story, but but that's because it there's really almost no regulation. In fact, there's a website now, it shows all of the pharmaceutical compounds that are in over-the-counter supplements. They are often put in there because it just sort of an arms race between marketing and detection in the age of the internet. So supplements are very interesting should they're also really great ones of the Wild West in terms of Regulation because they are innocent till proven guilty or his drugs are guilty until proven innocent. So what works well in the legal system, is it not nice for the best the best way to work in the Pharma and supplement pipeline, but it's interesting to know that anyway,  So how are nutritional questions study like one of the things that we hear all the time? As you know, the study did this and we found out that and I've come to realize and I think I need to actually Jack this up a little in the in the exercise class A teacher maybe this class and day is it in order to understand those kinds of findings? It's really important to develop inability to look at how those findings were obtained and the trouble is that as I said a small effect like a 10 or 15% of fact on some measurement you like blood LDL levels or performance in an exercise task or you know, something like a cow protein in the brain is a hugely important number for instance. If your potassium blood potassium levels double that would be hugely problematic. It's only a two-fold difference. So, you know when you have studies that we are measuring things.  Figuring out what you're seeing another statistically significant. How is observed is a major issues? So I think this has to you know, b and end biology is becoming more of a quantitative science, which is a great. Thanks. That's a good thing. Okay, so I just thought I would talk a little bit about some of those studies are done actually pretty interesting and it will give you a vocabulary that allows you to think about these things, you know in a in a more refined and maybe some of you already I don't I just don't see there's not a regiment over there probably for all biology should be quiet biostatistics class. I really think that probably sit like everyone should know, you know, what a meta-analysis is and what you know what these kinds of things are. So we'll try to get some of the way so, you know, you you might wonder where these questions even come from like where does the idea that LDL is good or bad come from and where is the idea that you know saturated fats are not as good as unsaturated fat in one of the places that  Date ideas, first come from are at work on epidemiological studies and there the study of diseases in populations, but they can also be syndromes. You know, yesterday's observation is tomorrow's disease, you know high LDL levels used to just be a biochemical observation and gradually people realize it LDL could be problematic and be symptomatic or causal of certain diseases and syndromes. So epidemiology is the study of diseases in populations and they these you know these studies and it's a whole field of his stuff. You can get a PhD in epidemiology for a living. I have incredibly powerful statistical tools to tease out Trans in populations in Allen. The epidemiological studies were the first place if people realize it's smoking was really a bad thing. You know, I mean, it's kind of funny cuz everyone's here to always guessed. It smoking was bad if you burn something in hell is probably better especially the first I hope none of you have ever smoked a cigarette, but I can tell you so, you know  Do it yourself at the first cigarette. You smoke you confer about 20 minutes and why that and then become something people can't stop doing is amazing to me. I don't understand that. But if you don't want to walk through that first few times of hating it to then become problematically enjoying it so and Deputy but nevertheless epidemiologic size of the first things that teased out this huge problem and as biomedical people in this position, so is it going to be a physician citizens V one of the major causes of you know of of cancer in our population is still cigarette smoke and what I've noticed is that young people have started smoking again. So people in my age bracket like 40 50 60, who am I kidding? 50 60 70, they don't smoke anymore and it's funny. If you go to a scientific conference with people from all over the world. You can always pick the people who aren't American cuz I'll be a little cluster with cigarette smoke coming from it.  For some reason by the United States is actually got a really good job of getting people probably scientist or a little bit more prone cuz they understand these studies but now I can smoke again. So I just want to say something it's not really nutrition but it is a plant that we consume and we are a weed states are there Alternatives, but I have never in my old old enough to be your grandfather life ever ever ever ever. I know a lot of people had to have two best men in my wedding is I know so many people I liked our president. I know everybody they love me but I will say this that I have never in my life met someone who said damn am I glad I started smoking ever ever ever ever ever. So that's where that I know I'm doing that old guy should movies were when I was a kid.  It was free. You know, I mean, I know this is annoying to hear old guy stuff. I get it. But this one old guy nugget, please whatever wherever is coming out of me. This nugget is in front of your friends who smoke to stop smoking. It's just if there's no upside none except maybe that your taste like an ashtray, but other than that, there is no upside. That's all I'm going to say about that. So does epidemiological studies version of control study situation where you have some K some medical observation people with extreme kind of cancer people have knee inflammation people that you know, any sort of situation is medically definable and then we control the group that doesn't have it and you go to links to try to define the differences between those two and the very best case-controlled study all other variables they can is many  Play both sides of the same between casein control to see what's causing it. So I suggest causation populations. You just find out about the populations and try to statistical methods to parse them out to weed them out. Okay, now, there's two other kinds of studies and these things can melt together. But these are really common terms and you see them when you sort of peruse the internet literature on medicine one of the great things about the internet it's ever so much information. But one of the very very levels you can get information that's utterly useless in its Simplicity or information. That's so technically you can barely make your way through it and there's filters, you know that I would like. Stupid for me so I can let you know that that's something so it took this is stuff for people who are dummies, but curious. I kind of curious dummy. That's what I am. I need some of this  So cross-sectional studies are really a study where you compare or you look at some variable or some question in a set time and a group of people like you could say to people all walk this much at this present time and hear their cholesterol. That was that's an example of how much do you walk a day right now? And what are your cholesterol levels be a cross section is taken by the slice near cross-section through the group in a set time group of people or animals or whatever together and quiri them right then and there and there's no worry about history. There's no worry about finding out what happened what's going to happen. Then there are Sadie's called a longitudinal studies and longitudinal studies are through time. That's real terms list. Okay, so we'll have a case.  Controlled and what I need though, when I do this terms Corral, who is that? I need someone some ta to photograph this cuz I always forget to talk a minute and then I leave the room and then it gets erased our way some t a i a could photograph this I would be so pleased. Thank you. Then. There's a longitudinal we all know that word 11222. No.  Longitudinal art through time through time. And so this really two ways to do that number one, you find a group of people who looks interesting and you know something happens to hey what happened tell me about your past to get here. So that's a a retrospective longitudinal study and then there's a prospective observational however, in a longitudinal study researchers are conducted several observations of the same subject over a. Of time sometimes testing many years and you can already see this is a lot harder to do right? Because if you just asked a question about right now to a group of people you haven't had right now that's perfectly valid way to do a study. It's not very deep in terms of cause and effect but it can be done right then longitudinal study involves either figuring out what happened in the past, which is fraught with difficulty or keeping track of people while they progress through life or through what's going on.  So the two versions are a prospective study and a retrospective study. So prospective study is watches for outcomes such as the development of diseases or syndromes during the study. And releases the other factors such as suspected risk for protection factors or whatever the said he usually involves taking a cohort of subjects and watch them over a long. Of time. You going to come over it will go to that. She needs these terms Co  Okay, and we have prospective for the terms I going to have to make a Corral bigger perspective.  The one thing I've learned as a as a professor, maybe the only thing I've learned besides all that science and figured out how to write big with chalk right, bro.  spectators  chicken wing nutritional but you can see how important these would be for teasing out nutritional facts, like how obviously important this would be especially in the human population be trying to figure out things like is Arda are artificial sweeteners bad for you. When is a perfect example of that? Okay, and so a prospective study watches for all comes with a starting group a retrospective study looks backwards and examines exposure to suspected risks a projection or any lifestyle, you know, a good Prospect a good run a patient group or a group of people to do and don't have some syndrome and try to figure out what was different between the two in time that's relevant. And can you don't know what's causing so many valuable case-control studies such as lean and clean ponds 1926 investigation of risk factors for breast cancer where retrospective investigation  Please send the currents are some medical disease or something. You didn't anticipate like let's say a cancer cluster. Suddenly you find in a town 25 people get the same leukemia in a thing happened. The only recourse you have is if it's a retrospective study trying to figure out what happened. You can also do Environmental Studies and there's also think you do but in terms of what happened to those people and whether it really is a cluster that's super important you start with a group and then see what happens and that is true but both are very useful. Okay, so a cohort and I sort of jumped ahead of myself as in statistics marketing and demography a car. It's a group of subjects. We share defining characteristics like you could be in a women between the ages of 30 and 45. It could be students, you know who are majoring in that people who live in the river on campus, whatever it can be any group of people who defines pretty open-ended.  I typically subject to experience a common event in a selected time. Such as occupation birth graduation, etc. Etc. Okay. So here's two examples of prospective and retrospective studies actually bring the lights down a little bit.  Cuz it's hard to see the script discovered. I once went up there and sat just for fun didn't give the lecture up there but I went up there and those little TV screens are like worthless. You can't even see your good young eyes cuz I went up there I didn't I was like, is that a screen or what? This is my right here, but a retrospective prospective study put in a simple term self is your actual examples of wine. So this is a very famous that I'm going to go into more detail within which a very large number of nursing a female nurses were studied for a variety of reasons. And so the prospective study starts with the cohort without any assumptions about you know, and finds out about them. I mean a good Lord has to have some, nowadays you want to have a more restricted set of features of that that there aren't too many kinds awning variables. Okay, so you might have age limits you might have occupational  Mission place where they are place where they work something like that other circumstances that are important. And so then in the prospective study you start there and you move forward in these studies can be over years or even Generations. So it sits there there when people do them. They do them with very large numbers a very long time scales happen for in the biochemical literature is people want to know if caloric restriction which will talk about more causes longevity and primates. So, I don't know if you took my 102 class. We talked a little about this but caloric restriction meeting lowering the number of calories in a balanced way. He's the very best correlated with longevity. It's really very true. It's true for yeast rotifera spiders flies nematodes any kind of organism, but it's hard to test out with primates and you have to do a prospective study. Love you one good way to do it. And so the people take a group of primates or Reese's  Rockies live to be 40 years old. So that's a prospective study that takes a long time and crazy thing. There was two perspective rhesus monkey studies one said yes caloric restriction improves aging and the other said no doctor for decades a grandson of my most complex results. So this is prospective and retrospective is, you know, you have things happening and you want to figure out in retrospect know what is happening to be retrospective. Respective. I respect you, but this is the case where there was a study where a certain subgroup of people in a large industry. We're getting we're getting a certain illnesses and they they took the clerical people and compare them to people work in the manufacturing floor for a tire business would be figuring out the diff.  This is between know if the tire making was problematic. Okay, so this is incredibly classic very famous study, and I'd actually impacts on nutrition and health in ways. That wasn't the original intentions to one of the great things about a prospective study is if you start with a huge group of people and Define a cohort the more information you distract from those people the more different things you can explore like just because you started wanting to know this if you have information a question may emerge but you didn't even know about so there are studies that have started before we even knew the DNA was a double helical molecule, and now people can be in the late stages of those studies. Do you know genomic analysis? So we don't even know the questions we can ask or answer in some of these things so big they're very powerful that way. They're their databases that transcend our limited creativity when the studies are met  Famous ones, the nurse nurses health study nhsl colloquial name and not 1976 who wanted to understand the degree to which birth control using birth control pills was problematic for Women's Health for many different parameters Because by the late seventies, right before many of you were a good idea. There was a substantial numbers of people were starting to take birth control pills in they had not been really in are they not been on the market for a very long time to meet again? They've been gone through that whole process of phase 1 Phase 2 3 and seemed quite safe, but you know the phase 4 is when they put a drug on the market going to happen. So the nurses health study that was launched with over in this is 70 117,000. But if he number I read is 121000 Nurses they were all between the age.  3045 they were all married for various socio-cultural reasons and they've been they compared a number of different things. So the original original idea was to try to understand the effect of those drugs, but they collected so much information that it's a series of prospective studies to send the epidemiology of long-term effects of nutrition hormones in health and disease development Studies have been among the largest investigations in your risk factors are major chronic diseases. So this study now there's now some of these are the children of those nurses are not ended so it's just going on and on cuz once you have an infrastructure to do a study like that you can keep keep capitalizing on it. So this is the original purpose of this had some narrow Focus, but the information collection was so well done that they came up with a bunch of different things. This is an example of a of a publication that came from the nurses health study.  What's cool about it is this is a journal of the American Medical Association Jama. That's a very very popular Journal. I'm sure if you become Physician's you will read many papers in Jannah. We're jamming. This is a very popular the New England Journal of Medicine is another very very high-level important medical journal also, but this paper was in jail, So it is called wait wait change and coronary disease in women an interesting thing is it's risk within the normal weight range. So what they did was take this huge cohort of people of nurses so they have similar occupations no similar broad age bracket similar socioeconomic background or socioeconomic lives and then analyze different many different aspects. And so I want you to notice. First of all, you see this is prospective cohort study, so you not know what that means. It's forward in time setting female registered nurses in the United States. That's what the nurse said. He was participants a total of 515818.  3256 years in 1976 with well without a history of previous coronary heart disease. That's a t h t mean so main outcome incidence of CHD Define is non fatal fire to car. In fact or fatal cardiac cardio cardiac heart disease. Okay. I'm so this is the sort of thing and the amazing thing is that with this prospective study that she's out a Clear Connection in Risk to these diseases in a weight range is relatively normal to the body Max index you may or may not learn. This is a pretty crude indicator of obesity. The reason it's pretty crude as it's based only on height and weight. So some of his very muscular and lean would have a high BMI as someone who is obese and and not muscular. So it's it's it's an incredibly good Public Health device and Anna prospective study with hundreds of thousands of people. It's a very valuable way to bin people than a manageable way, you know, but if your BMI  High or low that doesn't say much about your particular state of health until you understand that your body composition all that fits a good starting place when you're a physician or something and you have someone with a BMI of 30 immediately want to know what they're there their fat composition was with their exercise and diet was liking and why they have a BMI of 30, sometimes it's just really obvious a bodybuilder. They may have a BMI that I simply because they have a high muscle mass one of those things unhealthy like that's that's a very slim person and up around here and she's going crazy. I can't help when you get to sit on the podcast. This is great this thing about BMI just sort of like a log scale like it's a very broad range of weights and Compass one height so you can go on your computer there a tab.  Look up a BMI calculator this hundreds of them on the Internet. And if you punch in your weight and height will tell you what your BMI is and then you can play with your what if I gained 20 pounds and you will see your BMI will still probably be pretty close to normal or it will be in the normal range. Cuz that range is quite big. Okay, but the interesting thing is here's percentage of number of non-fatal heart attacks has many many people but you can see it doubles person years of observation. So these are any person years of observation mitochondria. In fact Park rate per hundred thousand person-years infarct is not something that happens every day to everybody which is good news, but you can see it it goes up almost all most triples with within a body mass index range and the rate ratio. This is the ratio of the rate change. This is the change from low BMI. Now, you know, you might reasonably go will how how you know, how unique a variable is that? What about other things that cause BMI in those are  Really good questions. What these kind of studies are good for is generating hypotheses. Hypothesis is you know, what you say. My model is that this perturbation causes this outcome. That's the only hypothesis if this if I change this then I should have reserved that, you know, it's an experimental idea in general is that we're always trying to falsify are a one way to view experiments as we we are only interested in information that could be falsified if an experiment can be done. So yeah, I did it. This counter loves me more than any object in the universe is not a testable. I cannot falsify that even if I trip over and it hurts me, that's my fault. It's still loves me. So, you know, that's that's not a testable thing. You can't falsify that information. It seems very unlikely that something made of such a simple molecular structure would be able to do that. But who knows?  Knows what the universe has in store for us, but there are many things you can also I think the boiling point of water is 50 degrees Centigrade. You can test that and say no it isn't a bunch of water in 25 laps did it but that's the basic idea. Okay. So how do we ask questions? We can use animal experiments or human experiments really incredibly exciting right now right now if it weren't an age where where genetic manipulation has unprecedented specificity and an alacrity now, it is incredible. So, I'm sure most of you heard of crispr cast 9, it's almost like I'm Hallmark cards and may your crispr modify you for the best Merry Christmas, you know, I mean, it's it's so it's but the thing is crazy is that came out like 8 or 10 years ago, like it's really really current, you know, if it is completely change the face not only of it.  Mental science, but you know of a biotechnology and maybe even culture, you know, we already have at least a pair of humans who have been modified permanently buy a crisper cast nine Shenanigans. So this is a whole other conversation and really an interesting one. But so we're in an age where their genetic manipulations are completely facile words used to just be like a pipe through another thing that's important about that is actually a great I'm not going to put in the terms us but there's a wonderful podcast guy named Peter attia. I don't think podcast fan. I think podcast would like the microbrewery of the information age and I was just a million of them and you can do anything you want there. Like the wild west with Peter attia is a MD and he's very interested in trying to integrate the wellness longevity biomedical literature with actual medical practice and he interviews all kinds of  Certain type of diabetes in experts and sleeping there just very entertaining podcasts. Plus he trains down at Mission Bay on Sundays. You can go hang with him. If you can ride your bicycle fast enough, at least that's what he says on his bike cuz I've never gone down there to see that you know, but  he actually is is a very big proponent of these kind of things and he wrote a wonderful wonderful prospectus called The Mousetrap. This guy's research any became an MD and I just think this is a really interesting tract and I will actually post it on the Triton Ed site for anyone who wants to read in this is not required reading. It's just think it's interesting about the idea that trap.  Okay, the idea that so much of a biomedical information. We have been done with mice and that's for good reason your tray congenic mice. I mean when you have a a bunch of mice that are the same of the same strain are basically clones of each other. So it's like being able to do a thousand individual twin study. You can manipulate one Gene and change it. So it's amazingly powerful, you know one very isolated genetic outlier in a world where humans are very different from that, you know, every single one of us is every 500 base pairs were different. So, you know, we are extremely very genetically from each other and you know, there's a lot of effects it don't come out in a simple mouse that he still an interesting observation exciting things about crispr is you can manipulate any DNA if you're clever enough to get those tools of molecular tools into the organism. So it's going to be there going to be an explosion.  Simpson on model organism studies that you will all be benefiting from his pretty pretty awesome and pretty incredible. So animal Studies have a bright future but bottom line organisms or whatever is you still have to figure out ways to do human studies. So human studies are still you know, the the ultimately the most important way except for veterinary medicine any hypothesis must be examined. Like if you have a hypothesis that this particular dietary manipulation causes Alzheimer's cuz you did a rat or a mouse model of it. You still have to figure out ways to understand two tests. And so, you know, the the ID of human experiments is critical and there's many amazing nutritional experiments with humans that we will talk about throughout that, you know, throughout the throughout the quarter. Some of them are prospective retrospective like hey, what did you eat? Why are you sick or here sign up for the study and 20 years later. Well, what did you eat? Those are reasonable and very powerful.  But there are plenty of experience you actually take groups of people and feed them different things and see what happens and chocolates are there actual hypothesis-driven experiments. So the best sort of experiments. Maybe this is a little bit over this but I wants to make sure we're all on the same page or what they're called double-blind studies. So, who knows? What a double-blind study is?  Yeah, I'm about to subject and the researcher. Thanks the subject and the researcher are both unaware of the of the of the scientific manipulation and it is it right. Now you might think you know, what why can't it just be the subject why can't the researcher knowing the fact is there are tons of examples of research are caused by us. You know, basically the problem is the scientists were human. I mean, it's not a problem. It's hard to test that but I just a human and you know, they want results in her interested again, and there are all kinds of ways especially in studies with other humans were the effects are fairly small like, you know, an exercise science is a perfect example as usually, you know, a researcher will have a desired outcome. Like I'm hoping this manipulation will improve performance. We all want to be negative information that fill them if it doesn't work at Thomas Edison found amongst his 800 is useful information, but it's not  You can tell a lot of people about so we'd like to learn something new and usually that means an experiment working. So, you know, double-blind studies are super valuable. Another aspect that that is is Iran part number called crossover study so across I just don't even know what a crossover study is.  A little bit trickier. So crossover study is when you have a control group and a manipulation group. You let the experiment run make your observations and then switch the group's you cross over. Now the control group becomes a test group of the test group and control group. And that is a very powerful especially if you can do a double blind. So a third party is controlling who becomes crossover and when that happens so nobody knows what's going on except for a third entity because a crossover studies any differences between the two groups that are caused then get wiped out when you switch it if you still see the same effect. So this is how it's actually it's kind of thing. You might not know the name, but you probably think of it if you're doing an experiment like, you know, it's a pretty intuitive a very powerful way to self control in experiment. Okay. So this is the basic scientific method this is from our book and at least that you probably have all her this can be a science major.  Is it never really here a formal description of the scientific method? And you know, it's an ongoing thing. There's some really interesting ways to answer basically have an observation made in this could be epidemiological stage something like that. So many people that you know, it seems like people who have extra weight are more prone to get type 2 diabetes this I'm a physician. I have been practicing for 25 years. I've seen that or an epidemiologist says it's interesting the groups that been into the higher BMI have a higher incidence of you name the illness or in the people who don't eat this particular nutrient seem to have this particular syndrome. Those are you know, the observation to be anecdotal and there are many examples of anecdotal observations that have great power, you know, and then there could be epidemiological were some statistician or something is teased out a trend and wants to know if Israel so that generates a hypothesis, you know, I think that that not eating vitamin B12 causes pellagra  So you can find that out and then you have some kind of experiments conducted and I want to say something is I run a laboratory and I have really incredibly awesome people work in my lab and I've been lucky to do this. I've trained for 13-14 phds they've gone off in the world in the great stuff. And we all together have learned of this green square should be the size of this because the hardest thing to do is to figure out how to ask that question experimental. I told my people this a million times actually, it's really you don't have these younger the grads of Life who died first. It's science is troubleshooting like the hardest part of doing science is not interpreting the data. It's figuring out how that correctly and usefully get the did how to get the system to answer the question you asked without confounding problems difficulties of data analysis or or or acquisition. So a big part of it is is that this is an arch to figure out how to ask a question at the lab.  Or in other modalities to do that and your findings evaluated by other scientists. So one of these about scientist it's not science until someone else reads it and agrees with that. They don't have to like it. But pure review this part of getting it out of the world as part of science doing experiments is not science. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition for science science is a group effort of taking these studies and integrating them into a whole body of knowledge your follow-up experiment conducted to confirm or extend the findings and four small lab science. Like we work on how misfolded proteins are are detected and destroyed really cool topic very relevant matically really fun, very interesting but anybody could take afternoon or reproduce them. So there's a certain safety net. But what about one of these studies in this thing? I told you about where you have 30,000 people with breast cancer taking this new antibody or not and you got to find  How easy is that to repeat? Okay, let's do it. All again. Get 30000 more patience like that is really hard. So, you know, this idea of reproducibility of experiments is very challenging sometimes and unfortunately, the hardest experiments reproduce are often the ones with the biggest impact and I don't think the research were doing in my lap, which is really good and really is going to kill anybody if we publish something wrong. We don't publish things that are wrong, but if we did is not going to kill anybody, you know it on the other hand. There are clinical studies that were not well conductor or even sometimes not nearly as often as you'd believe from the media which likes the clickbait thing, you know, the news is not go over. Well, he's a everything's fine. I'll click on that but it is true that sometimes people will do unethical things to publish a scientific study. So this is why you no follow-up analysis is so important and then a hypothesis is either accepted or rejected. This is one of the basic science.  Message this is actually from your book and the book actually has is a beautiful book, but it is sore. I guess you can read this year. Let me see. I'm coming up to see how this works. Now. You can see I'm a grandfather looking to come up the stairs.  I can see what I did was stretch it. You notice how it looks a little funny that was a circle in the middle of stretched it out to make it look like a lot of lock it but that's I guess it's readable not on those crappy. Oh wait, we can do this screen good. I mean big screen little screen wrapping.  I give you stole these little ones for your frat house or whatever. You be like hero I do. Okay, so they're not worthless for the side group. Awesome inside group like margin eyes. I just mean positional  so okay importance of this is actually a more a more detailed when the Witch and this has actually been on going and going on is he have you have observations by physicians indicate the type 2 diabetes is much more common in obese patients and leave patients in this is easily observable. You have epidemiological studies show that type 2 diabetes is more commonly found in obese populations of me or once this is not the whole story to say it is a it is a predilection it is it is a causative risk factor there plenty of obese people who don't have type 2 diabetes and there are people who aren't so it's not like black and white it's not like Mendel's peas. And now it's more complex of case-control studies show that obese patients are much more likely to have type 2 diabetes then cleaner comparison groups that are matched. So this is the value of a case unless you try to really match as well as possible different lifestyle things. Do you smoke do you exercise? Where do you live? You know, how old do you all this kind of thing?  And then you can have laboratory animal studies which are you millions of these studies going to type 2 diabetes is a very hot topic because so many people have it, you know, and we'll actually have a lecture on diabetes and talk about that but it is a major field of research for good reason and then you can have human studies where you can either, you know conduct weight loss in people who are have it or do other things are certain surgery strangely enough to seem to reverse type Dubai diabetes and very hard to understand why so, you know, those are can be considered experimental protocols. And the thing is they all worked together since the importance of Sciences. It's a definitely a multi-person multi input thing, you know, we love the idea of the one brilliant scientist to figure something out but usually they either figure something out that is a great hypothesis or they figure something out that everyone else was going to pile on even you know, Einstein, you know, the theory of relativity, which is you pretty much alone person came up with that and you know,  Did anyone come up with this crazy shit, but the fact is ignoramus body of experimental work is going into testing the theory of relativity and showing that it makes so much sense would like wonderful things like, you know, Moon passing over stars in the leg in the light just incredibly incredibly cool experiments by as a group and you can even deposit and I'm probably getting way you could easily say that science is a spiritual thing because it makes each person participating part of something much bigger than themselves, you know, if there is a secular non-denominational version of spirituality has to do with working in groups to a common good purpose be obvious good practice sometimes dubious practices still work. This is just a crazy story. I thought I'd throw in here. This is Joseph goldberger and Joseph goldberger was brilliant guy and he was studying an essay.  Allegra which is a deficiency in vitamin B12, but at the time in the early, I think the late eighteen hundreds of the early nineteen-hundreds people thought it was some kind of disease that would you know some kind of my ass mess. I'm kind of I'm kind of illness that floating through the air the idea that it was nutritional seems unlikely cuz it's so nasty. And so he hypothesized it was caused by poor diets not infectious agents in feeding healthy people poor diets, and you get you need a really poor diet to get to develop a patient's diet to the improved. That's a good thing. He and his assistants also experiments of the injecting themselves with pellagra patients blood and took capsules filled with their scabs and it didn't catch the Great Lakes the show doesn't look like a disease the trouble is ears after his death people finally started cameras that you know, that crazy do Goldberg. He was right so he didn't get a lot of credit.  Yes, but you know, sometimes just doing the wacky thing. Have you guys heard of helical back there?  Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers it's a bacterium and the guys who won the Nobel Prize actually ingested here. I go back there and gave themselves ulcers to to to to provide really striking evidence cuz it seem like such a crazy idea. I mean, you know ulcers have been around since humans have and they've always been attributed to some kind of stress and kind of, you know, some kind of internal biochemical neural input and it's quite clear that the subset of ulcers are microbiological Laura King of the stomach is a major a part of ulcers is a microorganism. So that's a very famous story any questions.  Yes, sir.  Do what?  Now that's a great answer. The question is is is the source of or are there phytochemicals it affect bioavailability or another way to do it is, you know the source of the ability to vitamin C to get out in the body and that's definitely seeing this gentleman uses from bioavailability, which is a fancy word for 8 getting into your system from an injection or ingestion. And that's certainly possible. I mean one of the things is a wave foods are presented sometimes slower is better. There's a pattern called glycemic index which is how rapidly blood glucose goes up when we ingest it and you know, there are different ways to present the same amount of sugar that bleach it slowly into the system of much faster. So beautiful really good. Yes.  Like you said, mi-24 myocardial something might of myocardial infarct. Thank you. So am I is a myocardial infarct stock-in-trade medical term, but I appreciate that anytime. You see an acronym tydl that you don't like let me know. Okay?  Am I let's add that to the term Corral, Michigan. Although there many Mi is in Michigan because they have to spend all winter eating meat. Okay. Let me check this nothing. We need to text Master General cuz it's just off the chain.  Do we have discussions this week? Yeah, Wednesday and Friday. I told you that in class but but it's okay. You can miss a few it's going to be okay. Why is she going to get it? It's probably more that it's the huge amount we eat and the  Fructose that we take okay, but did that's something people trying to figure out probably it's a combination of composition and massive amount. Do you live near Mission Bay I do.  I thought you were going to go with that.  What are person-years those aren't the number of years I've been studying times a number of people that have been studied. So it's an indication of the study's density. Good. I'm glad you asked that.  And this is some pretty fancy technical, you know, what vitamin deficiency is affected by trip deficiency.  Are the terms of the black with the only ones are going to show up on exams and stuff isn't that is just going to be an exam. I got your number bro funeral food things from me that slides in this I try to get as many here, but they will be at terms and study. This is going to be posted. Each week is MSG bad msg's actually neurotransmitter glutamate, so I wonder okay.  Can double blind be used on Xbox that don't have a placebo? Well, it's hard you could have no treatment and treatment, but if the people know they're getting the treatments and it's the pussy was a good way to mask a treatment. Sometimes it's hard. Okay. These are their dick questions are rolling in and I know it's like the more I text the last election and understand what these nutrients in such as deciding how much we need and it turns out this is something people have thought a great deal about and you can really think about energy providing nutrients and now energy providing nutrients. This is one place where government efforts have really been very very positive and very useless. I want to talk a little bit about this. So first of all, those the energy value of food and again, you know, there's a little bit of cantilevering if you took exercise physiology cuz it's all calories are all about energy. But who knows? What a calorie is Sky? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  You can just read them slide there. Anyone know?  the calorie  Yeah, what's up with the new person?  Yes, sir.  How much water like a ocean?  I got some calorie is the amount of heat or energy. You need to heat a gram of water one degree Kelvin really or Celsius to the same scale? Yes. Okay, and sorry is that and that's a very tiny amount of energy, you know, so a kilocalorie is a thousand times at so I can see we have a kilocalorie.  This is probably old hat for you chemistry types, but a kilocalorie is a thousand calories. So it's the amount of energy or heat. You need to raise a liter of water 1 degree Centigrade. Okay and a calorie with a Capital C.  Is a kilocalorie? Okay. So in in food, the way food is thought of it is in terms of calories as energy density. And the amazing thing is the way that Foods get measured for the energy density is literally by burning like bomb calorimetry is totally unfancy. It's like people want to go start taking foods and come busting him and see how much energy is in there and amazingly even though that's super crude and there's a lot of steps between consuming of something and it being completely combusted, you know, in terms of of harvesting of bioavailability of calories. If you want to put it that way of microbial microbiome digestion and removal are harvesting of the calories is a ton of nevertheless. It is a pretty useful gauge for consumption of energy. So food energy is more active Express in terms of kilocalorie, which equals a thousand calories if the sea in calories is capitalized. This is also signifies kilocalories. So a calorie is the amount of heat a Capital C calorie is the amount of heat it takes the races.  Picture of a thousand degrees of water at one of the cool things is that these macronutrients have a very uniform calorie density and they're amazingly easy to compute. So a a car with most carbohydrates are all carbohydrates that are like galactose glucose lactose fructose Manos multi dextrin. They all are about 4 kit for calories per gram. It's a very accurate thing. Okay. So a piece of bread has a 20 G of  I'm starting it roughly 20 grams is a piece of bread. So that's 80 calories right there. Okay, a Snickers bar 280 calories protein is 4 kilocalories per gram of fat is 9 kilocalories per gram. So interesting thing if you want to lose a pound of fat has 4456 g450x x 9 x 9 that's over 3000 calories. So losing a pound of fat requires 3000 calories to be absent from input or burnt in case of this is actually pretty useful rules of alcohol is 7 kilocalories per gram and a gram of alcohol is roughly about a milliliter, you know, so long with your meal. You're young you can handle it and that's a lot of calories. So that's and we're going to have a whole lecture on alcohol cuz it's such an interesting nutrient.  What's a bit of double-edged sword that's going on now is the United States and other countries to visit his pretty uniform if you travel you'll see birds. And so this all over the world now have for any food that that's manufactured and sold as a grocery or in a food place. You will see a description of the of the nutrient value. And so one of the most important things I think it's the calories and universities capitalizes kilocalories and everyone uses back and check your textbook makes the rejoindre that they send them to use the little C, but they mean kilocalories are never talking about one gram of water being heated 1 degrees centigrade is just too small an amount. Okay. So this is actually pretty useful the one of the things any of you know, is that you have to be paying attention to the serving size and the people that incredibly weird unrealistic ideas about what serving size is like who eats one Hostess Twinkie from a pack. Come on.  Costco these really nice dumpling soups, and they're very easy to heat their tasty and they have dumplings.  turtles in them  It's a 300 calories per serving a serving of half a bowl of this one serving thing is like four months. I've been eating like twice as much as you know where this but nice these labels actually have a great deal of information that will talk about in a minute. They have you know, the fat trans fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium. So how did the people know these things so it turns out there's a government agency called the food and nutrition board and the food and nutrition board is put together by the national academies of science medicine and engineering and it's an ongoing Board of people who are biochemist and food nutritionist who make recommendations for how much we need to get how much we need to consume of both energy rich and a and a nine energy providing nutrients. So it turns out there's a hole in hell and you know, I think it's important we see these I'm not going to write all these a good example of the you to be able to  Say what these things are briefly, you know, they're very especially if you want to be a physician's it's useful to know where all this comes from butt. So there's a daily reference intakes RDR. I will put that down here.  tnf dri's  Okay. So do your eyes are daily reference intakes? That's how much of a person is in head. Now, the trouble is people are very in a people of varying in size people vary in gender people vary in a lot of different ways. So did the trick is figuring out how to standardize these things. So there's a number of different things was estimated average requirement. So that's the average requirement for a population of people there's a recommended dietary allowances and I'll show you how these stack up there's adequate intakes. There's tolerable upper intake an estimated energy. So this one here is where you start getting into shaking too much of a nutrient and these three are about how much you need for all to be well, okay, so they're all related to each other and the bottom one is estimated energy requirement. That's just how much fuel you need. Okay, we're not going to talk about that right yet because that's usually a certain number of calories. It's based upon basal metabolism and Toby interesting. This is actually a nice way to put it so  Estimated average requirement is 50% of healthy North Americans would have an average intake if they consume the the estimated average requirement for this is a one of those statistical things are 50. So it's an average. It's a place where 50% of the people would be satisfied with that. So you wouldn't want to use that as a standard for everybody's nutrition could half the people wouldn't the right amount but it tells you what the shape of the curve and where its position is recommended dietary allowances r i d a r497 or 98% of the people. So that's you know, that's a pretty safe indicator of how much people need to consume in. This is calculated by very serious studies in which you you you feed people different amounts and observe blood levels in different markers of  Of success in that the upper the upper upper level is the amount where it starts getting problematic. There are nutrients you can take that are bad for you. If you take too many, especially for instance fat soluble vitamins. There's a limit to how much you can take without problems and most of safety then there's also a very interesting adequate intake and adequate intake is set for some nutrients instead of a instead of the recommended daily allowance. It lies somewhere between the RTA Surfer when they don't have enough information so often you have a good idea of like if you take this much everyone's going to be fine, but they haven't actually generated those curves. Are they get to 50% and the other 97% are statistical curves like a standard deviation above me and all that. Those are curves. They have to be generated. So AI is a useful case when there isn't as much information, okay?  So this is actually a pretty simple way to look at it is insufficient update intake is down here. This is increasing nutritional intake so insufficient intake is this measure here? It's below it would be below here is sufficient insufficient intake and then it around what's good is already anai. They fall in this range, you know an ETA are the estimated average requirement would be somewhere between here so half the people lose out and then up here is is is upper limit what the range is r and the interesting thing about I thought this was really interesting cuz there's a whole lot of Food Science going on their whole departments that there's tons of them and you think that this would all be pretty nail down for most nutrients but adequate intakes our daily and take them out set for nutrients which are for which there are insufficient resources.  AR meaning one of those curves you really know how the population behaves based on observing for anecdotal. Okay, like for instance bone health or white blood cell, you know number and function. So for a particular Life Stage Group like rtaa, I can be used as the golfer usual intake, you know, if you're trying to decide how much are currently essential fatty acids fiber certain vitamins and minerals and vitamins and of choline and fluoride are all a i discerned. They have not figured out for any of those major nutrients what the curves are for people to you know with a 50% point is in the 97 98% for me that there's still a lot to learn about. These are these are pretty basic pretty basic nutrients including essential oils. Not just like weird phytochemicals or anything so intriguing  I want to talk a little bit about nutrient density. So the interesting about these dri's in the assist you can start thinking about what is being consumed how useful it is so you have on one side your energy providing macro macronutrients like protein fat carbohydrates and they provide energy and if you consume those and don't bring the energy they will be stored mostly is fat and I was a little bit of glycogen Moses fat were very very good at doing that and then there are the nutrients that you need a plethora of them. I showed you, you know, the basic ones that are essential and is probably a bunch of phytochemicals are good for wellbeing. We don't know about yet. They don't even have a eyes let alone rdas. And so the interesting idea is this concept of nutrient density so determined nutrient density and I don't think anyone has to do this is just the sort of good Dunkin experiment the head of government is you divide the amount of nutrient in a serving of food by your daily recommended intake next divide 2 calories in a serving.  Who buy your daily calorie need sex the estimated energy requirement and then compare the two so food is said to be nutrient-dense. If you provide a greater contribution to your nutrients than your calorie. Lots of calories. Not a lot of nutrients is lots of energy but not a lot of of you know dietary benefit. Lots of nutrients not a lot of calories is the opposite of orange is a really great source of vitamin C cuz it doesn't have that much sugar. It tastes good has a lot of vitamin c in orange is not a great source of calcium because for the same amount of calories that has been very very little calcium. So those are just examples in the most egregious cases some of these junk food. So you probably heard the term junk calories and junk calories is a very valid ID and junk hours are basically foods that have a very very low nutrient density and you know, that's that is because they're easy to manufacture is much cheaper to manufacture of soda with a certain flavor then it you know, what a healthy fruits are you will notice Jamba Juice cost a hell  A lot or naked Naked Juice cost a lot more than a similar calorically dense Coca-Cola in a Big Gulp example that so this is the nutrient profile of a Coke of an 8 oz Coke and I'm a big fan of coke. I love it, but it's not very nutrient dense. And then this is a a cup of milk. Okay 8 oz of fat free milk Chia protein vitamin A Vive Sol says a huge nutrient density compared to this at the start of the definition of that kind of thing. So the trouble is that like I showed you you will see dri's how we got one minute left. My watch has a GPS watch satellite regular to go one minute. I know it says 20, but I got when I'm on the right of it, so the D rise in all that stuff. I showed you the rdas in the eyes. Those are very specific for groups of people in different phases of Life different genders, and that's not very useful for a supermarket or for a food supply where you're trying.  She'll do a lot of people in want to have a rule of thumb that's safe. But but not completely crazy. And so this comes to daily values and daily browser generic standards that were developed by the US Food and Drug Administration because dri's are age and gender specific. So I think I will stop there and we will continue and get into digestion next time.  I will remember where I am.  San Diego "
