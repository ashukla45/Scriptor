I guess the professor before who I know that's happened to me that just seems like the kiss of death for people falling asleep and whatever else so I'm going to keep it if people really would rather have it all night club ecstasy. Whatever. Let me know. I don't mind either way. It's just it's nice to see you all too. So I had to leave it bright. Let's see. He's so a couple orders of business the exams are ready. You can pick them up at the exam Depot. The mean was 68.5 which is actually pretty typical for one of these large class exams. The highest score was ninety-eight. So someone could get pretty much everyone right? I am always worried if you write a test where no one can do. Well that's truly and unfair test. This is a hard but fair test important thing is that I grade on a curve. So, please don't let the test dominant you're thinking but the material dominate your thinking  This is my suggestion. Okay, and the standard deviation is 2400 broad range broad range. I'm going to have a re-grade process all the scribes you next time. I'll put the key up on the have a look at the key. You know, I believe it's your right to demand to regrade is part of the learning process and I'm against any sort of any sort of game playing right to say we're going to go back through it and find something's wrong. That's basically just saying we're unprofessional and don't know how to grade a test correctly. So I have no interest in amplifying that idea. I also think that when people do that, they're just trying to use fear as a way to keep you from getting what you possibly deserve. So I'm against that anyway, but he's not criticizing her judging. I'm just not doing it.  Okay, where use the Bold experiment the text question thing. It's actually been working really well speaking of which.  See if there's no there's one now and our text Master General has been doing a great job and really appreciate that. It's super fun. And it's a completely risk-free way to ask any question you want without a general Buzz General active meaning of alcohol? Okay. So I'm speaking of that several really interesting questions popped up and I thought I would have dressed some of them because I don't get to every question. Some of them are really worth this guy singing. I think it's totally awesome. If people are all sorts of questions in the truth is I'm not a dietitian or nutritionist. I'm definitely not a physician. So send them the questions you ask me. I can't answer that Mike. Should I be eating this or that I don't know. You know what I don't want to be telling you stuff. That's just basically not true cuz I have the ability to speak with remarkable Authority about things. I don't know anything about  So I have to be careful about that and I don't want to do that. But here's an interesting question if ethanol is a FURminator product what's going on? Why am I not Intoxicated by microbial fermentation if it is created by fermentation to got how does this alcohol uptake exposure contributed are terrorists what a wonderful question. So first of all what you have to realize that the word fermentation is an incredibly broad term fermentation does not always mean making alcohol. It's any sort of bacterial metabolism that involves not using oxygen. Okay, and if you talk to any wine maker or brewmaster, one of the features of the art of making alcoholic beverages is keeping the organisms all sorts of other fermentations general term and ethanol is one of the better products of fermentation, but there's fermentation to make all sorts of things. So when we  gut microbiome fermentation that does not necessarily mean alcohol production, but  it is worth mentioning that your gut does produces small amount of ethanol. Your gut produce is methanol your gut produces butanol and propionyl if your guppy is all kinds of interesting molecules, and I'm not going to go much into this but they're actually was a legal defense and would someone who got in a car accident was able to claim that their gut had producing of ethanol to make them drunk and it wasn't their fault. This is an actual legal case. It just goes to show that legal decisions are about what's most convincing as opposed to what's most true important thing just a big difference really wonderful question with the important point for us. The science is that fermentation does not necessarily mean ethanol production and the amount of ethanol your gut produces is well within the range of the kinds of molecular ways. You can deal with it. It's not a coincidence that we have enzymes.  That metabolize ethanol into Safe products. Someone also asked is ath really the abbreviation for alka dehydrogenase because they're thinking of antidiuretic hormone. Probably sadly enough both are abbreviated ADH and because alcohol is a diuretic is actually makes it a little bit dicey and complicated but we won't ever get in that trouble another good question Pepcid help the flushing of face from acetaldehyde. I got this several times that I looked into it. I guess people drink they carry Pepcid. So this is a thing it turns out it is a thing because Pepcid is a Pepcid is a histamine.  histamine H2 receptor  antagonist  one of the ways that your gut produces acid is through histamine 2 receptor stimulation and Pepcid is a drug that you can buy over the counter to block acid secretion through this histamine signaling axis and the flushing that's caused by acetaldehyde is thought we threw mast cells that produce histamine. So it one model is that it it it's through his histaminergic signaling in decreasing that that's at least what I was able to Peru is so it's interesting. I didn't know that was a thing to people carry Pepcid to the bar because more than one person know that was the thing is another really interesting question. Why is there a genetic aspect alcoholism? For example, if you have an alcoholic in the family you're at a higher risk of developing and that's a very complicated question. It's something first of all, it's important to realize it very large-scale studies of Alcoholics.  Have come up with a thought that it's about 50% of the propensity to become an alcohol is explainable by genetic. So it's not like, you know, it's it's not written in stone. But it is true that alcoholism has a genetic component. It's probably has to do with CNS processing reward Pathways other genes and have very complex interplay with the with the behavioral system. There are also mutants that people have devised in animal models that metabolize alcohol differently and people love the idea that you can explain alcoholism by degrees in metabolism of alcohol that is definitely not the case. It is much more complicated than that. There is some interesting observations between different subtypes of dopamine receptors and propensity to show addictive behavior. But again, it is just a biased towards higher probability another important feature is that parents who are alcoholic often have  Aldi in parenting in ways that are the most healthy in that can pass through in a manner that's more socio-cultural. I supposed to genetic in those are very very hard things to unravel, you know, a good examples. If you didn't know anything about genetics, you might think that speaking a certain language is genetics cuz it Maps so perfectly well to offspring and their parents but it has nothing to do with that. Okay. So that's sort of silly example of the same complex. It's just super interesting question. But like many of the most interesting questions, it remains interesting because it's a question. I mean, I know that you guys are in the business you are professionals at taking questions and converting them into tight answers to get full credit. And that's a great thing to know how to do as an undergraduate. But the truth is you're all moving towards the place where you will be professional is advising questions as opposed to answering delivering answers. And so this is probably another this is a very active field of Investigation is are their addiction and alcoholism jeans to what extent of those overlap.  What kind of brain systems are involved how definite is it? You know he's important question really good stuff. We talked about alcohol hard to talk about how we're sorry, but something uplifting an excellent vitamins like the opposite and I'm kidding. Of course if you can drink you should and if you can't you must not but vitamins are in a clear important part of nutrition. You don't have to be an expert in nutrition. This may be the first word. If you said your Trish and maybe that half the people in the world will go vitamins if you ask for in a word association and it turns out there's a lot to think about in vitamins and nutrition in and what's cool about these lectures at that Nigel first put together that I'm sort of modify is it they take us into a lot of really interesting biology. So one way to view thinking about the nutrition vitamins is it is there certain guideposts into all kinds of interesting biology.  We've already talked a bit about some of the water-soluble vitamins that are that have tight connections to metabolism through being co-factors of enzymes are going to talk about some other ones that I need lectures of the first lecture is fat soluble vitamins or let's get it. Let's get our going to put the top fat soluble.  Vitamin C. I didn't eat my vitamins and that's why I can't reach the top of the board.  Let me see something. All the erasers is 1 still here. They're all still here. All right, that's great. We're doing together. We don't get a save half life to see how long it take to disappear. So there is no there is no talk about vitamins without mention the name of Casimir Funk which has to be the coolest science name I've ever heard Casimir Funk is actually the person who coined the term vitamins and it's worth doing a little bit about him. So Casimir if I mean, this is actually a westernization is real name is Casey Amer Funk with the K Funk was the same didn't modify that it was a Polish scientist born in the late 1800s red was reading scientific literature and realize there were certain diseases that were alleviated by feeding people certain foods so that the one who started with a disease called beriberi, which is a B vitamin deficiency.  And they were given a substantial amount of brown rice. They would have kept better. He just thought that was amazingly interesting how many people knew this but he decided it had to be that there's a single factor in this food that makes them better. Now, there's no reason to think that's the case. It may be 15 dietary sources what people are getting that butt butt Casimir Funk was convinced. This is the age of early biochemistry that this is the case and he isolated that substance for beriberi which is a vitamin B1 and then I did a number of other vitamins this way and he thought he was under the impression. They were all Amis. The first one was in a meeting so he called them a means Vitality for good health. So we called.  Vital remains and then I convert a vitamin vitamin and he would be very proud to walk down the street and see the Vitamin Shoppe and vitamins for sale online and really it was a huge transition in nutrition because it imply there are single factors that are absolutely required for health and the ability to grow and maintain an organism nutritionally. So real interesting and these are the ones that he discovered and there's of course the larger number going to talk about. So this is actually from his paper in 1912. That's a long time ago that you know, he started working. No one had any idea about the underpinnings of these is a component to metabolic illnesses, you know, and this idea of single molecules being important is so two of the same idea of specificity. So this is a quote from that from it is  By certain preventive substances that isn't the case of course, but there is completely General and division substances, which are the nature of organic bases are some general idea is okay and that you know, they're essential nutrient. So one question is how do you divide them from things that are essential like water or mineral? So Ivy essential organic substance essential organic substances needed and Trace quantities. Okay. So the yield no energy but many faculty have many facilitate energy and chemical reactions factors on it that are you know, if you can see why it is important as many of them are co-factors for dozens of different critical a biochemical reactions, and that is the case but some of the dinosaur  A very interesting alternative important functions that are brought involving Gene regulation rather critical aspects of physiology. So they're involved in the functions of the body development and Immunity go over those if absent from the diet vitamin will produce a deficiency syndromes would be surprising exception of you can be very ill from not having a vitamin D but not have a specific deficiency syndrome. So vitamin D deficiency syndrome is a general General illness. So and they're not an organic nutrient. So there are micronutrients that are minerals and that's a separate category. No Trace there certain Trace elements. We need low concentration is super important. Those aren't considered vitamins or funk, you know extraction from foods of these critical elements that went missing.  Really obvious and clear syndromes. Okay. So one of the interesting features of understanding all the vitamins is this idea of Total parenteral Nutrition parenteral is an interesting word. That means next to the digestive system means it means nutrition that doesn't involve so many Sticks nutrition. It's administered by some means other than oral or rectal intake and sulfur most most the time that's intravenous self realization that there was a certain number of nutrients that worse countable and not infinitely. Like I said, it could have been the wires of nutrients certain vitamins is quite possible to raise an animal or even a human without ever entering food in the gut. It doesn't mean it's going to be optimal nutrition and  Is it very interesting sideline that will probably become more obvious in the next 10 or 20 years is what's the difference between you know minimal nutrition that will keep a person alive and growing and Optimum Nutrition that is a really interesting question as well. But it's the fact that the realization of vitamins meant that was quite possible that you can call it a critical test of Complete Nutrition not necessarily Optimum Nutrition, but Complete Nutrition. So this is a paper from the journal surgery that was actually published in 1968, which isn't that long ago, you know last century to you guys, but you know what they're many many people including your professor who were alive and well and this is the first time people are able to put together the idea that you could completely raise an animal or even you know human on this situation.  Involuntary, or they can't use their digestive system. So it's a really important medical tactic to be able to feed, you know, a patient or an organism completely without using your digestive system. So this is example, but it really is if you want to look at it's a great test of having all the things you need for for for viability because if you don't if you're missing one of those things, you didn't add it to your IV bag or whatever there's trouble. So. So, this is really everything we need this isn't everything that will make life. Perfect. But this is everything we need so it's actually a surprisingly small list of things to to to to to do nutrition potato. The potato is has everything a human needs to survive again. It is not optimal nutrition, but you can survive only on potatoes and in the same way everything we need is shown here. I'm going to get rid of it.  Ring Spotlight by the okay, here we go. So we have no carbohydrate glucose alone will do the trick and you know essential fats just these are good enough, you know, linoleic and linolenic acid or enough because they build those critical low concentration Regulators. You have a choice you can make that from glucose. We have a small number of amino acids are essential water minerals trace minerals some questionable that live on the wrong side of the periodic chart and then these are the vitamins fat soluble and water soluble vitamin C and end the next couple extras on these vitamins cuz they are really interesting and an important and 80s into a lot of cool biology. So there's two general classes of vitamins, and I'm sure you know, this is water and fat soluble vitamins and really can just look at the structure.  Immediately know what's what the fat side lies are highly hydrophobic. They look like they look like they have long hydrophobic Tails. They're pretty obvious what they are, but there's also a small list that you can learn if you're not comfortable with a kind of structural chemistry. So there's water soluble or fat soluble vitamins and they have different properties so fat freezing systems are aqueous. Okay, they don't have much storage smaller storage pools like your total body water is than the plasma plus about that volume again, where is fat stores can be very different between people and quite large, you know, so so Waterside revised have much store smaller pools and you can deplete them between 1 and 4 weeks. Okay. So vitamins takes about 20 to 40 days of deficiency before the first symptoms, and then there's one exception is vitamin. B12 is actually stored very assiduously and is not easy to deplete.  Sufferance Insignia of the classic story of scurvy the British Sailors to go out your Conquering the world and not eating any fruit and after a couple of months their joints are tickets or things start going terribly and after about four or six months, you know that have terrible illness that's only fixed by sources of vitamin C, which was predating is but it's a good example of how long it takes for these vitamins to deplete in contrast fat soluble vitamins have a much larger pools of storage you can take up to a year or the vitamin A deficiency to become so we have these really a pretty prodigious different from water soluble vitamins is the fact that they can be toxic. So most water-soluble vitamins, you can take them until you just your bank accounts to plead it.  Vitamin in studies were one of my heroes scientifically Linus Pauling got way out in the weeds with completely untrue despite the fact that he had to novel prices a Peace Prize and it comes through line is really taught us how to think about having to be a professional computational. So Linus Pauling wonderful things for our the car culture has ability to think about molecular and biochemical processes, but vitamin C was not one of those wonderful things and it's just interesting fact that that when someone gets enough clout as an expert, they can be expert about a lot of things. They don't have any clout being experts. I think that's a small little tick mark on an absolutely brilliant career. So don't don't only his Vitamin C step remember that he was an absolutely amazing Force generator and thinking about molecular Inc.  cocoa processes anyway  Let's see. What was I say? So uptake occurs as Stouffer's fat soluble vitamins event takes not control the can reach toxic levels of we'll talk about some of those examples. So I'm taking occurs in the small intestine intestine along with lipids. So vitamins that are fat soluble require, you know, moving into things like chylomicrons and they're still inside when water that the moves of the blood. Do you have to be on a protein or some kind of a lipoprotein particle? And so I do have difficulty with drugs that block fat absorption or other problems with that absorption that can impact on vitamin transfer. Also, is it a vitamin deficiency is symptoms that occur when a vitamin is lacking in the diet and body stores become exhausted. Okay, so we will delve into that. So we're going to talk about is vitamin A.  A vitamin A is comes from a source molecule called beta carotene beta carotene is is the is the sort of plant source of vitamin A and vitamin A is actually this molecule cut in half or you could call this vitamin A depending on how you want to slice it because what happens is it beta carotene and its related molecules are found in a number of Rich carotene Rich plans and you don't need to be at Linus Pauling to this is going to be a molecule that absorbs a lot of light cuz he has he's conjugated double bonds. So kind of waited. So these are where you have a double bond election system and I want one with many carbs is very good at absorbing Optical wavelengths of light. So these big pie electronic systems are very good absorbing light and not surprisingly debate.  Retinoid containing vegetables are brightly colored cuz they're absorbing this amount of Life of that and leaving some behind. So it's really cool. It's worth noting. It's worth noting that  polyunsaturated fatty acids are not conjugated Pi systems. So this is the this is the sort of a the party hat of unsaturated fatty acids, and it's not conjugated so they don't have bright colors and they don't have that same kind of reactivity. It's just a different thing. I will add that the TA gave everyone credit for drawing the wrong trans double bond, and we're not going to go back and do anything mean but that is not because he felt bad. I don't know where that comes from his awesome. But but this is the correct configuration for polyunsaturated fatty acids, Bretton Woods aren't you know, multitrans lipids and they they have this wonderful Optical properties.  But it turns out that what we end up making from his car and I just a molecule called retinol, which is absolutely required molecule for a number of different a process used in this other the vitamin A source, beta-carotene produces retinol through a set of reactions. The most common one is it is a rash guard beta-carotene dioxygen days that use oxygen to break the scent half into two molecules of Retton now like that. Ok, and there are a number of different so there's retinal retinal and retinoic acid and a very lonely here. I'll write this down right now and I'm showing you here.  oops  retinol  and Rec to noack to know it acid and a very only y'all use the spotlight they vary only there. So you see that one carbon is oxidized it can either be an aldehyde or a hydroxyl group or a CO2 HR carboxyl group just different oxidation states of that terminal carbon. I noticed three molecules there retinol is the aldehyde the retinol is the hydroxy and the retinoic acid is a carboxylic acid and you probably heard of retinoic acid actually has many properties is one of these vitamin A derived molecules. Okay, we're going to first talk about right now because it has he's very interesting Optical properties. So probably many of you know that vitamin A and the molecules are derived from vitamin A are absolutely critical Envision. So this is the first place that the vitamins are going to take us to this is biology. It has to do with vitamin C.  The retina is produced from an absolutely critical for the fact that we can see each other and detect light and one of the things is very cool. As this is a very ancient a very ancient signaling process. So there's a molecule in the eye called rhodopsin.  The stock I bought this truck yet. I hated rhodopsin.  And it's related to a protein called.  And the family are proteins that sends light that since photons is ancient. So bacteria has a molecule called bacterial rhodopsin It's actually an Ancient Ancient cousin of the same road accidents in our eyes and bacteria use it to sense light also so that idea of using a certain class of signaling proteins to send flight has been around for a long time when pack. Humans have a common ancestor that's in your gut 3/4 in 3/4 of studies. No more jokes, just give us the information and we want to go home. Okay. So the eye has his beautiful beautiful arrangement of cells and in the back of the eye is a set of cells that detect the light.  So it's kind of funny to censor the lights in some cells are in the back of a layer of cells include the other stuff in the nerves in front of the great design in terms of building a camera but a great having a camera perhaps and so what ends up happening to these layers of cells and in all the way in back of his light sensing cells and those light sensing cells every one of them have you so mavyret sets of membranes that contain a seven transmembrane protein called rhodopsin Andrew Dobson is a protein is basically receptor would be one way to put it but it doesn't is if you look back at retinol when I go back this way released carotenoids again notices this distributed pie system here. These molecules are incredibly good at absorbing photons. Like I said, it's her nature is capitalized on that beautiful chemistry coming from plant molecules, like carotenoids to build a molecule that can sense light.  Where does it is rhodopsin is this is a picture of her adoption hearing one of the things that's really cool as we know a lot about how we see now. So this is one molecule of these ribbon diagram showing x-ray crystallographer is in cry OEM structuralist are very good at figuring out every Atomic Arrangement and a protein with the idea that they breathe and wobble around and Sarah Dobson actually is an option molecule with a cyst retinol attached to it. Okay, so sis retinol is one of the verge of retinol. I want you to notice this again is a fair amount of chemistry, but if you look who I'm going forward backward  What am I doing? I'm going crazy odessa's backward. I was in the spotlight button. Sorry. I'm blowing my punchlines hero crap. So here we go. So you I want you to notice that these guys that this has these are all trans bonds transferable Bond. So this one if this one's inverted it's called sis right now. So it's flip the other way cis-trans. I'm hoping that's comfortable from all the organic chemistry. You were forced to sit through. Okay and so is oxygen with covalently bound sis retinal detach to it. So it's actually sitting there ready to go. When is it happening is when light strikes that sis retinol when the right photo online isomerize is into trans and that causes the option to let go of the Sith retinol of the trans right now. So here you up you have light by and see her the option and the retinal dissociate the all-trans-retinol floats off into the cell and the  Option denuded of its small molecule is bounded denuded of its sis retinol now start signaling and it doesn't ever things because I am flexes to change in the cells and generates an electrical signal is in the realm of optical physiology. Maybe you had that in your physiology class for sale by Logic. So, we're not going to go any deeper into that. But then what happens is that sis retinol, that's problematic. It's just retinol gets converted by enzymes back into trans retinol and it gets added back on the option to make rhodopsin. Okay, and that is a cycle that happens billions of times a minute in your eye when you're seeing something anytime you're seeing Optical signal it's cuz you're constantly I summarizing the right now in the transit the option lets go of it be on TuneIn can signal then it takes it back up. So I was critical for vision and this is a word version also have a picture versions of retinol.  Mound jobs in proteins to form rhodopsin ceratopsians wrote his option + retinol bound together right now is released from Hopsin when the proton is absorbed. Let's go up for adoption in sis retinol. It becomes rhodopsin trans retinol when it absorbs a photon, then it lets go of it and he got it from doing its thing as soon as it lets go it starts signaling. So it's an interesting way to regulate a circuit and then the restoration of rhodopsin when you get rid of this silly Spotlight for adoption is the trans retinol is converted back to Sis retinol summarized by an enzyme and then it can recombine with the option to make another rhodopsin ready to receive another Photon. So every single one of these psychos is to pick up one photo. Cycle for every single photo.  Genius is a crap load of them in each retinal cell because you have two cents light off in a lot. Okay. So here's another nice. This is the sort of visual cycle and I want to focus on when part of it here. Okay, so we're not going to go deep into his physiology. You could teach a whole class on visual physiology and that kind of thing a credible variations in animals and people study at but this is maybe a simpler way to look at the visual cycle for these are all in your slides and they're all you know, they're all just different ways to say the same thing. If you if you Google it rhodopsin cycle, you got like a hundred million pictures of this process. There's like a lot of ways people but this is actually pretty simple is rhodopsin is option + 6 retinol, okay.  And the it you get here sis retinol gets converted into gets added to her dopson when light hits it. It releases trans retinol of an electrical signal happens. So this cycle only is looking at the retinol part. Okay. This is only looking at that. So this is really not paying much attention to the interesting component the signaling proteins just the vitamin A Product retinol Sol trans retinol is released. It also appears in the blood trans retinol that gets converted into sis retinol, I guess and so this an enzyme called rpe65 to terrible name is a gene product that was discovered long ago in these genome searches. What's interesting about this enzyme is it is absolutely critical for regenerating the cyst retinol this needed to key to activate the ABS and protein to be ready to receive another phones on and it turns out there's a  Make the efficiency in rpe65. So it's a kind of inherited blindness. Okay. And so what's interesting is this is a perfect candidate for gene therapy. And here's why if you're missing the den, the simple model would be you can just add back a good copy and get it working and not seeing what you've learned about us being recessive recessive gene doesn't work. And in the presence of the normal copy you can function again. That's why if your diploid in your carrying a badge in your so usually okay cuz you have a copy covering it so pressing that recessive phenotype. Okay. So the trouble with gene therapy is usually getting the jeans to the site where they might do something is very challenging especially if it's deep inside the body inside the cells, but the eye is pretty accessible. I showed you that chamber, you know, the eye chamber the retinal cells are right along a surface a few cells deep there's liquid in here and so the idea would be if you had a way to give those retinal cells  Gene for rpe65 you would correct the deficiencies what happens in patients who have rb60 by deficiency is a can't regenerate that needed trans retinol. So you get a very massive decrease in signaling and people who don't don't have rpe65 are very deficient in their ability to see and it's mostly just trans retinol. They've taken into the bloodstream from dietary sources, they can't regenerated and those processes happen fast. So a gene therapy trial was designed a company was was set up through a number of different individuals any developed a drug called Luke Lux. Aeterna. Let's turn it is nothing more than a virus that will attack not in a bad way but a virus that will inject its DNA into retinal cells and correct that Gene through simple viral mechanisms of Gene insertion. And the cool thing is that you wouldn't want that in every single cell in your body. Although nothing much might happen, but they can I know this  Hannah gross like my eyes blink when I look at it, but they inject a virus into the tissue it infects in a useful way these cells and corrects the Jean by adding another copy. So this was the gene therapy model and they got approval to try it was a trial in this is actually pretty amazing. So this young man in the front is Corey Haase and Corey Haase with his folks and some Physicians from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. That was a major gene therapy school and they actually had a mishap of another gene therapy process. That was more Global some very big problems arose from up with this particular trial work very well. Cory Haas was his situation his situation was it when he was he was 9 the youngest person the trial was considered legally blind before treatment again, he was confined largely to his house and driveway when playing headed men's difficulty navigating an obstacle course required special.  Large equipment for books to help in the classroom. So today this is in 2009 after a single injection of this gene therapy product. He rides his bike. He's no assistance in the classroom and navigate the obstacle course quickly and even is played his first game of softball like that is amazing. That's an amazing is a happy story but gene therapy is fraught with difficulties. I think the age of crispr is going to change some of that and create new problems. But you're you people are in a very exciting time a very exciting transition time for ver viable therapies, and they're going to manifested modifying immune cells correcting jeans that are problematic deep and deep tissue and accessible tissue. It's really an amazing times. This is just one example 2017 for the people who have rpe65.  360 by division is a rare disorder, you know very few people are legally blind because they have this enzyme that converts sister trans retinol back to Sis retinol missing but it is it is every time someone does a therapy like that on a small population. It works that bodes very well for you know, getting it better at at the bigger problems. So I buy aging that's what I'm really interested in them fixing their many functions of retinoic acid to retinoic acid is one of these these three varieties and retinol is the one we talked mostly about for vision, but they all have different functions and retinoic acid is particularly interesting because it is a general regulator of gene expression. So you probably heard of these nuclear hormone receptors for it, since you've heard of testosterone, you've heard of estrogen you've heard of mineralocorticoids, you've heard of glucocorticoids. Those are all molecules that stimulate a panel of gene expression.  A different changes that are very specific that cause a collection of specific genes to be expressed as one of those a program of gene expression to occur. This is sort of the way you think about is it has to get to the cells and then it doesn't do anything. So in your book there's a hole there's a whole process is described like this. But the first the first occurrence is that the red noack acid is or vitamin A is contained by retinol binding protein so dead could be retinol or retinoid acid It's contained by that it's down to two different proteins retinol binding protein in transit Richmond. These are just two carrier proteins in the blood to point B, baby sleep is it have to get around or either carried and lipoproteins. Are there carried by binding protein? So their particular retinol binding proteins that drag these things into the bloodstream and keep them.  Sorry about then move into the tissue. So this is Exeter the whole map of things that occur and basically vitamin A retinol retinoic acid ends up in the in the cells that are picking it up. It binds to another carrier protein is cytoplasm and then it gets transferred to the retinoic acid receptor and that causes a whole panel of gene expression. So not surprisingly these vitamin A derivatives have many physiological functions behind Vision. So the vision is a very special one is that does not involve of activate of a of a signaling protein is activated by an addict but the major function of retinoic acid along with that is is to do this panel of gene expression sew up some of the ones that important if you needed for proper immune function in the gut and other tissues so children with low vitamin A can get diarrhea due to impaired gut immunity that have a problems maintaining and controlling their microbiome. It's worth  The microbiome in the immune system do this fancy dance with each other where the microbes signal to the immune system the immune system keeps the bad ones that they and they all work together. So privations of the microbiome or the immune system can cause really big problems in the gut because of that dance being perturbed. It's also needed for structural Integrity of tissue. So many tissues require certain programs of gene expression to be maintained in to differentiate correctly this actually one of the tissues it's really strongly affected by vitamin A deficiency is epithelial cells B cells that line a lot of the lumens of organs and they can be flattened and shaped all wrong when when you have a vitamin A deficiencies discusses many physiological problems, and there's no way we're really used to eating pretty robust diets. It's very hard to starve to death in the United States if you have access to even any food supply that doesn't mean  Bass socioeconomic disparity but there's lots of food available for people who can afford it, but that's not the case in and every country in this in this study was done in 2009 were they just come by all the countries that are impacted severely moderately mildly and not at all by vitamin A deficiency in the thing is there's a ton of people suffering from severe vitamin A deficiency in our world, you know, it's just something to think about that, you know, there's abundant and paucity and they're just all intertwine with each other interesting problems to solve. So some of the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency or not surprisingly vision problems because of this importance in the retina version of vitamin A is too little retinol to regenerate rhodopsin. We saw very fancy version where there's an enzyme that wasn't resupplying that retinol, but there can be versions where you just not providing the molecules at all through diet.  Zero Fountain Wichita loss of mucus do this epithelial effects of the eyes. You can get dry eye and corneal sloughing so that it's funny. This part is due to is a vision effect, but it's due to this epithelial differentiation affect. You can get infections due to impaired immunity in the GI tract and skin dysfunctions due to due to problems in end now the differentiation program the retinoic acid causes in the skin. So those are some different things. So this is a little sort of recapping of the vitamin A deficiency in the important thing is that without an environment a death will ensue so you can get a you can get a vitamin A deficiency sufficiently low that the person will die just like with other vitamin A and vitamin deficiencies. So these are some of the most of these are you know, our our vision related but not all of them. Okay. This is the normal function with this is the first time we've talked about a vitamin A.  Toxicity. So the fast label vitamins are the first place were really talking about a nutrient that has over toxicity know someone could easily argue that table sugar has over toxicity and that's true but it's over many years, you know, so that is a whole other conversation about, you know, the toxicity of overabundant natural nutrients in a real interesting conversation, but this is actually a case where you can have you can have toxicity first. We'll talk a little bit more sources of vitamin A is a term that popped up called the RAF has the retinol acid equivalent SSDI mean retinol activity equivalents retinol activity retinol is one of the ways to do I assign vitamin A activity cuz he's are all interconverted with each other and retinol is one of the easier to measure so so this is the way that the FDA leafy Food and Drug Administration has decided to measure vitamin A activity because there's a lot of  Plant sources of being converted into reading all these different carotenes and carotenoids. So it's sort of this gold standard is how much retinol can you generate and so the thinking is the size p e right here. I don't know why my guy that that's a weird artifact. Okay, so retinol activity equivalents of these things. So one of these notices that beef liver an animal products, you can get a ton of vitamin A so it's really available but it is also available and when leaves turn red, you probably don't know this cuz you're all Southern Californians but in the fall leaves go from green to red and that's the carotenoids lasting longer than the chlorophyll and it's absolutely view. Get a chance to see in Autumn. You must some day in your life. See you in Autumn is just nothing like it. It is really why people live in those cold climates. I'm pretty convinced I grew up in an Autumn an Autumn posit.  Environment and it's something that is just in from my wife is never seen Autumn. I had to convince her it really happen to know.  All the trees they don't believe it. Okay. So in those plants are brightly colored like a mango if you ever seen him and other bright orange spinach is dark green sweet potatoes orange. These are all brightly colored. So that thing about eating a brightly colored vegetables. There's a grain of Truth in that, you know, but beef liver is a fantastic as well is that vitamin A is also something that can impose substantial toxicity want you to notice it despite the a small number of syndromes and symptoms that come with vitamin A paucity. There's a huge number of problems that come with vitamin A toxicity. So I mean this list is very long. I think I've isolated here is even have a cute effects meeting right away. If you take too much vitamin immediately acute means right away, you know is your gastrointestinal headaches dizziness muscle and coordination nature changes in you know, in in sense of well-being and and feeling good you can get  Liver damage hair loss bone and muscle pain loss of these are serious things, fractures hemorrhages and then they're also need Vitamin A effects developing embryos. So too much vitamin A can cause fetal malformations and spontaneous abortion. So these are really serious things and so the ulv, you know, the upper limit that we talked about Jerry has a really important thing. I'm what's amazing. Is it vitamin A toxicity is not really that much higher like some vitamins. You can just take them till the cows. Come home is not one of those vitamins show a vitamin A is the greatest risk of toxicity have just two to four times the RDA can start happening. So, you know, there's this as some of the symptoms again, so the the upper limit is 300 micrograms of a retinal activity equivalents per day or 10000 international units. I mean, you know, if you're dealing with this as a nutritionist  Position you're going to look that up. So I don't care that, you know these things but it's important to know that the window between good, you know taking and overuse can be not that high. Okay. So now the thing that's interesting about carotenoids as they cause an orange color, you know, this is really true that it makes you wonder maybe that's an explanation for the strange taint of our commander-in-chief. We don't know no one really knows some things. He's very open about something. She's very secretive about tax and orange color or two of them. So in a way. Maybe the guy eats a lot of carrots, that would be good at but it is true that people who eat a lot of carrots you so this is actually an example. This is a guy and this is his hand and these are two of his his family members and this guy drank a quart of carrot juice a day. So, you know that it is a lot but it's not and you know, it's it's it's  Show me a reasonable amount of a story about that problem. You know, the cold water diet that came from a dinner. I went out with a bunch of Faculty. So you have this is our class. Are you have a bunch of people sitting around who don't know anything about nutrition and we start batting around the idea. What if you just drink cold water with that use enough energy to lose weight because we didn't know the difference between a big calorie and a little calories that we all decided. It would be a great way to lose weight cuz you drink a liter of water there be a thousand calories and you know, if you had to hit it one degree so man, we just need to drink we all ordered cold water not realizing that we would need to have ordered several hundred gallons of cold water to get any benefits. So that's where that problem came from an actual conversation of people that are really smart and really ignorant. So incredibly dangerous combination, so is there you go anyway, so this is a perfect example of that and so is there some course, you know, epidemiological and health studies that come through with this so high carotenoid  Are the risk of cancer and I'm not talking about high carotenoid like, you know causing these terrible chronic symptoms and the important point is it is very hard to eat plants to the extent that you will get vitamin A toxicity. This comes from supplementing and taking, you know, concentrated vitamin A that's available. So it would be very hard to eat so many carrots that you're going to get some of those vitamin A toxicity. You'll turn orange before that happens. Okay, but so, you know how high carotenoid diet does not mean, you know millions of units of RA. He's just being so diet rich in these things and there's a number of a cohort and case-control studies it indicate some very Striking Effects unless doubt that there's an improved benefit offer lowering the risk of lung cancer. Now, this is a carotenoid meeting those kinds of plants is spinach to Mangos the other stuff like that. Okay, so you might think well then nothing to do the thing to do is just take beta carotenoid supplement.  Beta carotene supplement, you know that's so there's actually a study this is incredibly to come up with an acronym that describes the study. So this is the beta carotene and retinol efficiency trial so carotene and retinol the physics. Somebody probably got their PHD for thinking up that acronym Moc. Okay, that's enough you win. Okay, does the beta carotene a retinol if it has a carrot which is pretty brilliant, but here's the thing so they said they tested it a high risk for lung cancer. I think they were hoping that they would get bigger effects. If you take people at high risk, the numbers are high. They did numbers move down. There is a higher signal-to-noise ratio, if you want me to look at it cuz he answered answered cancer higher so they were tested the effect of daily beta carotene and retinyl palmitate which is which version of retinol delivery.  Incidence of lung cancer other cancers indefinite 18,000 participants who are at high risk for lung cancer because of a history of smoking or asbestos exposure.  Parrot was stopped ahead of schedule in January get read along with me. Everybody will read together and I'm getting in January because participants receiving the active intervention were found to have a 28% increase in incidence of lung cancer 70% increase in incidence of death and a higher rate of cardiovascular diseases while he was going on. He beta-carotene was causing increased incidence of cancer cardiovascular disease and overall death. So this is a really interesting in this is compared with the group. So this is at least one case.  We're taking the single molecule is not equivalent to taking the plant that has that molecule in a thousand of the things in it. I'm a big fan of supplements. I take them every morning. At least it makes me drink a lot of water. That's my feeling is if for nothing else is making me drink a lot of water which is good. But so, you know, but it is interesting that it is not always the case of the single molecule that's implicated important is the only thing going on there. I might be delivery rate. It might be the way it's metabolize. It might be other things that come along for the ride. It's not clear. So this is actually some of the receipt doesn't mean if you take beta carotene, you're going to get lung cancer. It means that the probability shift a little bit and it's very hard to think about these epidemiological cases, but this is actually from that study. Sorry one of these days from the carrot study.  Stop with this cute name and the disastrous result if it's like Oh, I thought of that stupid name. Anyways, you know, but anyway, so this is you know, this is the no beta carotene the beta carotene. This is the incidence of lung cancer overtime over a number of years. So it you know that uptick which might seem fairly small and it is very small is statistically highly significant when you compare Placebo about and what's it's worth. It's worth thinking about okay, we're going to do a little text questioning where we got here. I have asked the same question about Pepsi before my pharmacology Professor. He said pop Pepsi couldn't really help with flush that much because of flesh is caused by histamine. I can H1 probably cross-reactivity. Mr. Pharmacology Professor, who knows what TP and kill off gut microbiota tpn.  What's tpn?  Why is there no data in the chart of vitamin A deficiency for the us because hardly anybody in the US has vitamin A deficiency in big pocket. So you can find people with with dietary deficiency, but they'll be distributed in that was awesome 2009. Maybe they didn't collect it. Why doesn't the FDA regulate vitamin supplements regulated and that's too purely to Legal Shenanigans to make it physically possible to sell them it is if you want to watch there's a really great movie called faster stronger or cheaper now about anabolic steroids and supplements that I can recommend you. It's really an interesting topic very important question. Is it true that the vitamins found in supplements are in different confirmation? Everybody needs. Usually. I mean usually the molecules of the molecules but it depends on the particular what I mean, that's that's a question with lots and lots and lots of different possibilities question.  Owen TBN TBN. Oh, yeah Total parenteral Nutrition cuz I find my brain. I don't have enough vitamin A. Thank you. That was the text message General jumping in the real world. So with tpn kill off the gut microbiota know because they're very resourceful at extracting in but it is true that the gut microbiota would not get very much flow through them. So interesting question, let me withhold that my nose was a little too quick cuz you can live a Xanax early with no gut microbiota, so wonderful question and I don't know the answer to it. So I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to find out because that's a cool question. If there's some microbial lab people in this class. Why don't you go ask your microbiome expert TI's and come back and tell us we're both doing. Okay. Let's see. That's that's that and I think we have a little  Quick relation. Let's get out those Clickers.  It's taking longer than I thought but that's okay. I'm the boss.  Plus, it's Thursday.  I like dress that no, but that no one's quite clear on why.  And it was a higher risk group. So me and that might have some to do with it. Okay ready?  Which is worse for you according to epidemiological studies?  protein from fresh red meat protein from processed meat protein from protein from plant sources, which is worse you from the epidemiological studies we talked about  Good for you. I'm just losing my shit today. Hold on.  Vitamin, it's alright.  Here we go. Here we go.  I can tell from the slope of the Curve.  All right.  How do I spend a real long time of these are we ready?

Alcohol is metabolized by ald.  I'm actually supposed to be a DH followed by a LDH. Sorry.  Hold on.  hair we go  sorry.  Where where we 88 followed by?  Okay, ADH followed by LDH liver meos pyruvate dehydrogenase both A and B.  Obey and be pyruvate dehydrogenase liver meals.  88 followed by a LDH  All right. I'm going to stop.  I saw those three people leave so I know another night here.  It is.  both A&B cool the process works  This is the major of this is the major one, but this is definitely a contributor and this second one is very important when you drink frequently or you drink a lot because it's an overflow system and it's an inducer blower system. So they're both super important, okay?  Let's see there a few more questions. Question about TP and it's really interesting. I'm going to look into that. They question that was on the floor is is there a hypothesis for why beta-carotene alone is somehow worse than exacerbates the same cancer that high carotenoid diet seem to lessen. There is not a strong hypothesis for a mechanism are they have done further studies taken at day to trying to parse it into groups to see if there's something they could split out from it and it seems there a certain subgroups that are more important than others, but you love total. There's not a mechanistic hypothesis. It's a very complex question, but it's a great question or it looks like this. This is called Co calciferol  And vitamin D is actually taken up in a number of different forms and converted by multiple organs into what's called 1 dihydroxyvitamin D3. So it's 125 dihydroxy.  Vitamin D3. This is the most active version of vitamin D. But we ingest different versions of it. So there's a number of different sources is vitamin D3 that people can get in the diet or vitamin D2 which is another a precursor of vitamin D. And those are converted either by UV light or taken up in the diet to make vitamin D3 which is called old calciferol and that's what shown on this previous slide. It really looks a lot like cholesterol, but we don't synthesize this we take up other plants and other organisms make it be it's not connected here, but it has a very similar structure when it's folded. The right way to clearly is covered with hydrocarbon. So it's very lipid-soluble. Then deliver takes the coke House of the D3 and converted into wine hydroxy calcidiol and then he died hydroxy D3 is made in the kidney. So it's taking up in the gut.  The skin converts some of the earlier free courses a D3 to D3 is taken in by the liver and converted to 1 hydroxy form. And then they want a drugstore mistaken it by the kidney in converted into the dihydroxy form. They have different half-lives in the blood OK and the UV defendant step is less efficient than older people people with darker skin and people live in high smog areas, which kind of interesting is. I was actually going to my doctor because I'm of an age where I want to start getting my numbers together being a newlywed looking for Medicare. I want to live as long as humanly possible. So I got all my number sending my doctor told me that San Diego has a weird vitamin D deficiency does not easily explain where the Sun City is many sunny days is a lot of outdoor altar over some reason people in San Diego and many other cities have low vitamin D does hard to explain and that's actually turns into be a national Trend also, so it started this is another way to look at it.  Multi-organ cooperation for vitamin D production. So vitamin D2 can come from the diet vitamin D3 can also come from the diet depending on the source of fish milk. There was a good plan source is 2x converted D2 is converted to D3 by light and then the D3 that's generated either by diet or light is converted in the liver to 1 hydroxy D3 and then 121 25. Dihydroxy D3 is the is the strongest version of this is made in the kidney. So there's this whole process going on this multi-organ process and vitamin D3 is another one of these hormones that can fit stimulates gene expression. So there's a vitamin D3 receptor that binds and it goes and turns on a lot of gene expression. So these are these are molecules that do a lot of things vitamin A and vitamin D both do a lot of things. Okay, so it's critical for bone growth in the young increases calcium absorption by the intestine calcium release from Bones to maintain blood calcium.  So it is has hormone affects and effects of differentiation of the skin. It has medical benefits. So it inhibits development of breast colon and prostate cancers at the right levels. It supports resistance to infection and some of the sources are fish fortified milk, but fortunately there plant sources to mushroom soy almond milk and sunlight. So those are all things in the first two are we eating or animal products in the next four are non eating or plant products? Okay. So Ricketts despite their does vitamin D deficiency will cause a A syndrome called rickets if children are deprived of vitamin D. They have very big problems in bone development. So they get bowed legs and they also get substantial growth of certain tissues that are normally constrained by good bone density. So this the heads and rib cages tend to be larger because the bone development strong and the legs are on  The legs are bowed since is called Rick. It sounds funny. They say that vitamin D deficiency is an observable, but I think what that means is that an if an adult who grew up eating normally is the pride of enemy. They don't develop a deficiency syndrome. Where is an adult being deprived of any of the other vitamins would develop an overt deficiency syndrome, even if they develop normally cuz this is clearly a deficiency syndrome, but it's contingent on a child undergoing bone development was kind of amazing. Is that Ricketts? That's what this is. You just called can be completely reversed if a child is a Cockerel enough. So this is a picture of a child with rickets and very debilitated enlarged head rib cage. Very strange Anatomy bowed legs and after 14 months. This child is running around and completely normal. So that's a happy ending to this problem. But there's like vitamin-a. There are vast pockets of of the world where people are vitamin D deficient so vitamin D requirements. There's also an upper limit  I'm so no rdas is because everyone process is it differently and it's contingent on organ size Oregon activity light exposure skin tone. There's really no RDA that's been you know, that that statistically designed when there is an AI and acceptable intake and that's 600 units per day for people under 7804 people above. So this is the number of micrograms of vitamin D3 out. So this is interesting though new research and I've I've seen some of these papers indicate that megadosing vitamin D might decrease infection. This is the new I know many people who take tons of vitamin D because they claimed it keeps him from getting sick because I'm especially if it's positive. So I keep a cold log because anytime I got to call I did work and it's clear that every 6 months I get a cold no matter what I do. It's just  Like I tried hand sanitizer and I was incredibly say I had in my pocket in my phone on airplane and do it and you six months boom call like so no more hands and it didn't make a difference. It might make a difference for other people. So this is the interesting thing is in toxicity depletes calcium in bones and increases calcium deposits of the jacuzzi is causing mobilization of calcium. It can cause bone malformations and calcification of soft tissue and kidney stones for certain people susceptible. And that's it for thousand units a day. So you'll notice that there are no research indicating that the same units that might be problematic could help with infections. So what to do, you know, this is an interesting question and you might be a physician and have someone who swears by the fact that they take 10,000 today and they haven't gotten a call for 2 years, but their bone density is going down when you tell them, you know, get them hand sanitizer. So this is actually  Studies of people with breast cancer and it appears that the if you do a meta-analysis in this is typical medical analyses Sur this pretty wobbly data with statistical significance that increasing a blood levels of vitamin D up to this in this is a pretty normal level. I decrease the increase the increase the survivability of breast cancer these people who have gotten breast cancer and been treated if their blood levels of vitamin D are higher they have a higher survival chance. Their Hazard ratio is lower. That doesn't mean they're going to be cured it means they'll live longer, you know, it's important and interesting ly in this integrating these facts is curious is this is a study done in 2009 that long ago looking at two different things as the number of people that are above a certain level in the United States is the United States of unlike that reasonable complain about the lack of information for a very large number of different cohorts. So this is age  Over-aged this is the two two biological genders. This is the race and ethnicity. So you see across the board that this is a study that was done about 15 years ago This Is Us ending so much more recently. So the gray is more recent in everybody's lower across the board. Everybody has lower than is there far fewer people who are above 30 nanograms per ml. Okay, so well, maybe they're just dialing in the right amount. So this is the people who are below 1000. That's very low across the board all ages gender ethnicity people have are more prone to have to low vitamin D and less prone to have too high vitamin D across the board. So this is a there's a vitamin deficiency is declined dramatically between 1990 and 2002 specially born as African-Americans. For some reason. It's not so clear or surfing the most weather that serve cultural interplay or it's not clear why  But it's important to be understanding of these things and it's not that hard to supplement vitamin D. So I one of the things you can get measured when you get your numbers down to the doctor is your blood vitamin D your Coke calciferol levels and it's not a bad idea because like I said, it's something that's been observed all over the place. So we're going to talk a little about vitamin D and I realized it when 20 comes we're going to wrestle our way out of here. So I'll get as far as I can and it's actually impact some very interesting that data. So this is tocopherol soalpha took off her all is one version. It turns out when you read the definition of vitamin A is actually eight different molecules that are certified Commission of different to Copper Alton. They all basically have the same business and so here on switch the spotlight mode see that that business and not that does not look sort of like something we used to study that looks sort of vaguely like Coke you going on with oxygen but it has his pie system on a ring with a long tail.  This turns out because of that that dying to see that double bond carbon double bond. This is really really prone to get out reduce. So it's an antioxidant, you know, it's it's very proud. I mean to get oxidized to donates electrons and get oxidized. So this thing is a is an antioxidant antioxidant spacely step in and allow themselves to be oxidized instead of things were it's a problem. That's the way it is anyway, so this is a collection of tocopherols there and there's also there's also alcohol there alcohol and other versions of this that together form vitamin A and basic vitamin E is good for is it's an antioxidant. It is a probably a biologically evolved accident that we use in a variety of ways to rope in these are reactive oxygen species got one more minute. That clock is fast my watches GPS satellite people so a deficiency  Hemolysis and red blood sensitivities oxidative damage. Okay, you can take up to seven years of steroid deficiency. So this is a very gradual thing and there's reason for that. I'll show you probably the next next lecture is a case of premature infants to one. One of the things is a deficiency of alpha-tocopherol or vitamin E is particularly noticeable in cases where you have oxidative stress or one case, it's particularly clear as they used to put premature infants in oxygen tents and they still do sometimes because they're in their ability to absorb oxygen is not great yet their lungs aren't fully developed at that young age. And so children who have a vitamin D deficiency and are in pure oxygen or suffering greater oxidative stress and they can't handle it. So it has been cases of those children becoming blind because of the perfect storm of high oxygen and low vitamin E smokers are more likely to develop a vitamin D deficiency because they're stressing their system or they demand more of it cuz they  Have a lot of oxidative stress from the chemicals that they're smoking. The toxicity is the UL is 1000 mg of epigram a day of his fat-soluble Vitamin. That's quite a lot in these symptoms are hemorrhaging. I think it's fair to stop here and we will go and talk about oxidative damage next.  sandiego.edu "
