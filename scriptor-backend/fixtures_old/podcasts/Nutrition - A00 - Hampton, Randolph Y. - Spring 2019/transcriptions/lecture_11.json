    "Full Transcript": "All right.  Okay.  Is is Laura the TA here?  Laura ta  Laura iata  No.  All right that I will text Master General myself. It's going to be a little rougher not a smooth butt.  If she kind of Laura comes, please come down and get the iPad meantime. I will just turn this on here like this. Okay if you think so.  Let's see.  I know there was an exam on Thursday. We're to chat a little about that.  You're going to pick it up at the exam Depot on Thursday of all goes well and Tas and I are getting together today to tally it up.  Regretted it very fairly.  I want to talk a little bit about that.  I do realize that it was a bit too long.  And that maybe a weight adjustment would be useful not like weight adjustment, but how we wait the exam. So my other classes I do this I used to actually get rid of the midterm if the final had his add more benefit, but I don't think that's a great idea any longer. So now I adjust the weight so that people still take the first midterm seriously, but I felt I don't want cause extra stress. It's hard enough being a college student to stain a so here's what we're going to do. This is from lecture for and actually I realized I didn't post this on the apartment. I was supposed to say have to worry about the way we count up the credit is 200 points in the midterm through the points for the final. So 500 points total protest make it a little easier. So let's do this. Let's do this.  If the midterm helps you meaning if you get a higher percentage on the midterm, then you do on the final will keep the term hurt. You meaning you got a lower percentage in the midterm that you did on the cumulative final then we'll wait the final a little more will make the midterm only go to a third of the way. You said it too fast. I will make the final two thirds of the total points will still be I had up to 500 but the midterm will have a little less way. Okay.  You know, I will point out that everything on that midterm was on the study list. I even had someone come up to me and shake my hand. Say wow. That was great. Everything on the study list was there so I don't think there's anything from Left Field. It was just a big deal fair enough. Okay. I'm not going to argue about it cuz I can't hear you. But you're welcome to email me talk to me. Also, I need you all to come down. I need you all to come down. I need y'all to come down. Thank you. I also am very generous in curving. I curved the test very generously meaning. It's a Friendly Card. For instance. Are you go if everyone had a 90 they don't get an a it's not cuz a real curve would be if everyone did Super well, it would still be a b c d. That's not what I mean by curvy. Okay, so I'm pretty generous many of you know that and you all know by his class. My goal is not to screw you hurt you or harm you but I'm learning how to test his class also.  Mythic if I don't pay that and also a very generous and regretting so if you feel you've been unjustly served and I've said this like a million times a million and one is that I never do this thing where I threatened to go back over the test and look for things that are wrong. I don't do that Randy don't roll that way. So if you feel you've been unjustly served and you put the energy into writing for a re-grade I'll take that from you and there will be a small window so I don't go crazy and get 600 400 of them. But if you know, they will be a. Of time in which you can submit to regrade and I will make that totally clear to you. Okay, so put your sense of victimhood aside and we will learn together. All right, there's something that I need to clear up. I feel that I and my metabolic teaching or whoever you took it from any organic chemistry Department have all fails you you should sue us as a  Class action lawsuit because this is a trans double bond.  Okay, I mean even write it down here.  trans double bond  and this are two representations of a cyst double bond sis means a carbon stay on the same side transmits a transfer across sites. This is the shorthand way to write it. This is the shorthand way to write trans all biological fatty acids have cyst double bonds. All of them trans double bind a fatty acids are in fact bad for us. They come out of industrial processes comes in a throw a screw out a girl comes all biological fatty acids that have any kind of concentration are cysts. Okay, please own that make that yours, please and here's are some examples of them. Here sis sis. Boom bah, sis. You notice that they're all drawn that way.  That okay. There's one other thing I want to teach you before we go further the cool thing about unsaturated fatty acids in biology as they always have a pattern and that pattern looks like this whenever there's more than one you got double bond saturated carbon double bond that pattern is always in polyunsaturated fatty acids, always. Okay look-see. Don't take my word for it here. Hold on. Don't take my word for it to do. Do do saturated double bypass a pattern. So there's a certain virginity to this. Okay or text Master General has showed up so we can move ahead I got to make sure my  Go to set up right and we go.  Can you please raise your microphone?  Let me see what I turn up high and then it starts beating back. So there's this dilemma little better.  Here, you know it's feeding back. Okay, so we were going to finish talking about protein animal plant protein. I will post all that stuff about waiting the midterm a little differently if it serves you. Well, I'll look what I got to the wife. I meant I'm excited about this. Look look, this is how much I love you guys more erasers.  Yeah.  Now here's our secret. This is just between all four hundred of you and me if I buy a Game of Thrones of 10 people know it's information is not a secret anymore. Okay, I'm going to hide in here is really live. Don't spread the word. Okay, because I bought 10 more also, but my wife's like what are these nothing?  Actually, there are useful I think people steal, okay.  See, all right so far so good. Okay, moving forward and different Studies have shown that red meat has actual problems in his consumption and there's been a very very large number of different cohort a case-control prospective studies looking at this one involving thousands of people. So, you know often moderation is useful and it's good, but especially process red meat result in higher risk of type 2 diabetes. It is actually been treated with different agents bacon pastrami corned beef delicious red beets. You know, I'm process would be like, you know steak from a  Richard animal maybe grass-fed if you really want to be Humane, so there's unprocessed and processed additional serving per day up the risk of type 2 diabetes by 12% and the process 30% higher probability. Then the probability that doesn't mean 32% risk is increased by that much and it's a fairly the risk write. Another thing is important is the person's other characteristics their lifestyle choices. Do they exercise they move around alot what are their genetics these are things at all in public health numbers different huge populations of people what reduces risk is nuts low fat dairy products whole grain. So they they really this idea plan and lower fat and less animal products is a good thing.  There's a greaser couple more studies. This is a study with 500,000 people over 10 years of these are huge number that's half a million people in a 30% increase risk of cancer when comparing people who ate mostly red meat to the least consumers and in this particular study in this is not this is an throughout all of them in this particular one women have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this particular wine, and I don't know in the case whether it's cuz the Baseline was lower and it went up more or other features of the of the cohort they used. Okay, then this is all cause mortality animal vs. Protein sources when I actually looked into this one.  Is a associate animal plant protein intake so all cause and cause Pacific mortality many all cuz you just look at death across-the-board. You know, I over a very long steady and caused the disease. What's a cancer? What was it? And if they see that let me do this that process read me Twas the worst in terms of of favor over plant and these other these other food sources not as bad in eggs are actually not as bad as process red meat. Okay, so the address cuz I looked into this a little bit more and and so this is a prospective cohort study. This is actually part of the nurses health study that we talked about before and a couple other so it's two different perspective studies knows how steady and from 1980 up to 2012 was 20 years of the over 20 years of following people, you know, multiple times and unlikely Zhang eggs study animal plant and protein intake was assessed by regular.  Updated validated food frequency questionnaire City really use the prospective power of of clearing people multiple times throughout it unlike the exit over the ass once and some people even on the test, which I thought was really cool suggested that was more like a retrospective study cuz they asked to tell you what they used to eat. So I like that you got credit for that other things too. But anyway, so this is what they came up with their what's intriguing as interest in this study. We found that the association of animal plant protein with Metallica, very by lifestyle factors of this to me makes me feel better about this cuz it seems a little bit more realistic and any statistically significant protein mortality associations restricted to participants with at least one of the unhealthy behaviors including smoking heavy alcohol in take me to talk about next overweight or obese city of physical activity. Meaning they actually said that if you didn't have any of these things the risk of eating meat at the levels they looked at  Sickly significant, that's kind of interesting. So don't smoke drink too much start moving and enjoy your Burgers statistical populations. Are you might be particularly sensitive? So why does it seem like there's many many studies involves. What's the deal? So these are possible contributors. Like I think one of the difficulties in health and wellness is that you're used to taking classes where people do an experiment and they see something happens this enzyme process this substrate and this pathway is used to make this carbon turn into that molecule, but there's only intriguing questions and reasonable directions to look further in and often. There's good suggestions. I mean if you are a physician  You would probably tell people they're worried about the house while I eat less processed meat eat unprocessed me eat more animal protein. I mean more plant protein less animal proteins are all very good suggestion. You're not going to tell the person, you know on June 11th. 2056 are going to have a heart attack. Like you can't no one can do that. So he's suggestions emerge from these ideas possible contributors are higher meats are hiring unsaturated fats. They don't have as many of these kind of lipids and we know those lipids are good processing processed food bazaars endotoxins to come from mild bacterial contamination there carcinogens that we'll talk about in the food supply their pro-inflammatory compounds both part of the meat and added in the processing guess who these are reasons. Why is another more recent observations animal proteins are more prone to increase hormone called insulin like growth factor.  When is the new hot molecule so igf-1 is an insulin like molecule evolutionarily very ancient make a little less. I can erase. Look at what check check is it out? That's smooth.  I am easily pleased it right now and please.  Was worthy Lux razor RZR. Okay, so just kidding there.  No one even better than everything cost a fortune in his disposable.  This is a hormone related to insulin that's release the times of abundance and controls growth. It's critically important in aging and all sorts of interesting stress states with the cell undergoes outre animal protein is more prone to produces insulin-like growth factor-1. Interesting things were learning here is it's very rare that someone gets one particular type of molecule. If you're eating more animal protein. It's cuz you read it. I mean more plant protein you're reading more plants and Less meat. So this a lot of things that don't come along for the ride and a lot of things to come along for the ride. So that's sort of a way to think about it, but not all plant proteins are for your problem. Is anyone want to suggest a plant protein about all the time that's causing all kinds of problems.  Newton and it's it's family members. I thought I was going to say cholera toxin talk a little bit about gluten. I mean, you can't, you know, you can't throw a stick and not hit something that's supposed to talk about gluten. I mean gluten is everywhere now gluten is a general name for a group of proteins found in wheat Rye barley triticale lots of different plants, but we tried and barley of the big three as you know, they're in everything all over the place, right? It's a cross of triticale is a cross between wheat and rye. Okay, so gluten helps food maintain their shape. It's actually a c a storage Protein. That's a very abundant part of seeds and Grains out, especially with this is actually a picture of a wheat grain. So has is the German the end of sperm and the brand  He looks like a wheat kernel looks like in this is weed. Amber waves of grain to these are all here. And we think we've been around for ten thousand years eating is agricultural products and before that as you know Forge products, but there is a disease that is clearly well understood or being well understood and very straightforward to observe called celiac disease that is basically a gluten sensitivity and it's a serious disease or celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed people. These are people with a certain HOA Class A Cell immune antigen and they have other genetic predispositions and perhaps there's inflammatory states that aren't that well understood and in those people gluten is really important perturbing of their health and actually causes drastic changes in the guts.  This is the normal Villi of a healthy and test remember, those are villi cells that we drew that have the beautiful capillaries and lacteals actually are strongly are atrophied and don't work while we have many gastrointestinal problems. It's a really serious disease and keeping those people free of gluten is actually very beneficial. It's why there's all this understanding of of the importance of gluten-free. So is the actual mechanisms are a bit complicated and I will make it quite clear of the limited amount. I want to know about this speculative paper, but they are not at all don't want to lead you down the path of thinking things are too too solid. You know, I think sometimes it's a disservice to take the latest papers and here's what's causing it when it's just a suggestion and there's men  Examples of that in in metabolism has peptide it is digested parsley into Peppers gluten is actually a collection of proteins and proteins are digested in the stomach into polypeptides, you know, amino acid chains and some of them are pretty resistant to be to digestion and they slipped through to the they slipped through into the guy and get him sore and those polypeptides are get processed by an enzyme that people stimulate an autoimmune response. Oh my God is my phone.  Sorry, that's really unprofessionals.  I haven't talked to this guy in a while either. I was time to go. Hey, dude, so fancy dendritic cells which are macrophages present. Those gluten antigens of polypeptides as a mute the intestinal the intestinal cells. So it's a it's a real autoimmune reaction and it's not good. Okay, and and people with celiac disease are very is very important for them to eat. Very little Glutton. Okay, but the thing is is this why everywhere you look there's gluten-free food cuz everyone has celiac disease in the answer is no it is a very interesting to call the Dilemma. It's a very interesting development that people are now extremely extremely concerned by the fact that they  I think gluten is causing a host of different problems in their in their wellness and in their sense of Health in their feeling good and it is to the point. Where is very easy to meet people who undergo a gluten-free diet. It is I actually went with a friend of mine that Italy about 5 years ago before the wave and really crested amazing as you think Italy is like the worst place on the planet to ask for gluten-free food, cuz it's all pasta. It's all these Italian restaurants were to that is quite amazing. It really is a thing and this creates an interesting dilemma because you're a physician someone come si USA. I'm got to be gluten free because when I eat gluten, I feel bad and it is very hard to know. I mean, that's fine as long as their diets good but to know whether that's actually  Celiac disease is pretty clear. But partly it's clear as it's very it's a very strong disease. It's a very striking phenotype. If you want Clinic where is gluten free at the response. We love you balloon freeze. Not the queso. This is actually a review article to a few pages long called Andy name for this midterm for this particular syndrome gluten sensitivity ncgs Gluten Sensitive. I'm gluten intolerant. I've heard that too. But this is an interesting review article and most of this review. It's about four pages long. Maybe we'll leave breed it together. I know you guys love to read extra pages.  I have spies in the discussion section, but there is no more controversial dietary Topic in gastroenterology or in the Western Community in general the other than celiac disease or wheat allergies. The aim of this review is to define the basis for this conference. You not to resolve it. Just a Define why is there controversy and some of the problems are there is really no obvious syndrome people can connect to the discomfort people feel when they eat gluten and the Comfort they feel when it stopped. There is no mechanism. There's no double blind studies double-blind studies are problematic me to take people take them off gluten. They feel good. If it's double blind you slip gluten black to that back of them and then they feel bad again, but that would be the way you could actually tell right. There's something really going on here. So it's so complicated.  Another problem with the whole gluten-free thing is that when you remove gluten from food you removing a lot of different things. It's almost impossible to only remove is gluten protein in a small family of peptide from something people are eating. There's all sorts of other things. So I want to tell you about one more dietary avoidance Factor. This is the very latest thing called.  fodmaps  have any of you ever heard of fodmaps fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polynomials make a what is actually a great acronym cuz it's much easier to remember the acronym than what it stands for. But it really is just a whole bunch of different related molecule saccharides in a monosaccharide glucose and galactose hook together into oligosaccharides. It's bigger than two disaccharides to monosaccharide some weird sugars that are fermentable meeting. Your microbiome has it has a field day with him, but you can't digest them. It's a a fermentable trisaccharide. You can't digest and it turns out that there is a disease called irritable bowel syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. You've heard of that maybe some of you suffer from it and this is it real.  Interesting development. I think it's it's a rare thing but it's very hard to find what it is. So this is from the irritable bowel syndrome Network. Okay, so and I will point out. This is a. Company trying to make money as a group of people and they have some products to sell but I don't think they're making a lot of money. So irritable bowel syndrome is the name given to a long-standing as consisting of frequent and Alison Bern's it cannot be explained by any other disease by process of elimination of celiac in their test for that. Do you have some kind of a lesion are you eating something poisonous in your food supply other illnesses, you have some kind of carcinoma triple syndrome involves long-term gastric discomfort symptoms include abdominal cramps bloating diarrhea constipation.  So I be as I do and I said has no specific. This is on their website. No specific cause no distinctive pathology and no single effective treatment the symptoms can vary from person to person and the same person different times but often in response to what happens or changes in Dyer Lexile. So this is a pretty nebulous syndrome. However, one of the most painful things for people who have chronic illnesses to be poo-pooed by doctors and other health professionals, if you have something that's completely balancing up your quality of life and you go to a doctor that's not a real thing. Anyways, one of the interesting solutions for this is is people with IBS whatever that exactly is are avoiding fodmaps these fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharide, then pollio's is the definition of and it seems to help a lot of people now, they're probably people also I have friends who I've gotten really obsessed with not eating fob maps and they just say they feel  Now whether that's cuz they're paying close attention to what they eat. You know, it may be doing other Wellness or because Bob Maps, you know tend to get into the microbiome fodmaps and do this. We don't know yet, but it's at least I want you to be aware of this cuz I've heard it mentioned many times in the last like half a year. There's actually please it. So this is a joke. This is the next thing we're all avoiding is fodmaps. It's it's pay attention. What was eating is good and people have is IBS, whatever. It happened. Whatever it is. If you give them less of this they often will benefit from and you can understand that the microbiome Dynamics would be a big role in this too. If you're eating fodmaps, you have microbiome bacteria that like it Bill X even get worse. So it's pretty complicated. Okay, so we're doing text questioning and I'm hoping yes, so I have some Craig a cat clicker clicker. Okay. I want to do a little click Elation. It's been too long. I know you've missed the fun respite of  And actually have a few questions. I want to ask want to find out if you things.  All right.  Are we ready?  I always do this.  Okay, I always do this.  And I realize you're my clients. I want to serve you. I think the exam was fair in the right length, even I don't think that too hard and the correct length, but too long too hard and too long. We had a test Okay, so  Actually, I guess some of these are assertive don't nap well to themselves.  But because if a test is too long, it would appear hard. So I guess they're not unresolvable.  I don't sell yourself short just because something is difficult doesn't mean it's bad your I'm not going to do any adjustments right now. You can email me or text.  It's not working.  Are you have a question? Awesome? I will take your question, but let's finish this. Okay stop, but she people don't even come in there so mad that didn't even come. I'm so hurt and traumatised. Okay, cool.  Wow, too hard, but a cyst double bond.  What did Bri is okay, I will try to make the study list even clearer, but you will have your heart and I will wait is like I said, so all is well. Okay. Okay. I mean you I know you can go online and see if the frequency of the grades I guess. I'm not about like seeing you out. Okay, so alright next.  my meat consumption can best be described as  reading  I eat meat regularly. I eat me infrequently. I'm a vegetarian. I am a vegan.  I'm going to check these while you guys do this.  Oh wow.  What?  What?  What?  No, just I want your impression. It's not like this isn't like a test like three or four times a week once every two weeks.  I hear three four times a week.  Four five times a week once every two weeks.  Never keep away from all animals.  I'm more about what your impression is to.  I'm hungry.  All right.  Okay.  I seems like there's more than three other people here. Maybe people didn't bring their Clickers.  Don't worry. There's plenty of time Fighting Chance.  Are you be regularly? Okay, cool to know and there's very few vegans. There is three of them.  Cuz there's an old joke about marathoners or vegans. How do you tell someone's a vegan let them speak for 2 minutes?  After smoking, this is a conversation that came up amongst the eyes and cheese and it was curious.  Okay, pure pure curiosity. I do I don't.  Are you still it's good to plan plan ahead.  By the time I'm 50, I'll be able to smoke.  Pull up during cancer by that. It's cool.  All right.  last three  Oh baby, you know I realize something. I'm stop. I'm going to stop now the last two one more.  Your cigarette burned fingers pressing the clicker.  Most vast majority do not smoke. That's a very I'm very glad to hear that. I have never met someone my age ever who is happy. They kept smoking ever. I kind of got it started this 40 years ago. And so I used to long ago. So I'm so short. Okay. So anymore I go that's it. Okay, so, you know, I'm I'm trying to learn and grow I will learn why you thought the test was too hard another some questions.  Other question is is igf-1 found in the meat or is it being this paper had to do with that we tend to release more of it when animals are giving me there are hormones in me, but I do have one wouldn't be one of them because it's a peptide when you eat it it gets digested but there's you know, there are really interesting issues with antibiotics in the food in the food supply that have to do more with resistant bacteria rising and you know steroids in the kind of drugs that might be able to endocrine disruptors. So there are interesting and important issues and what is being put into even agriculturally produced animal cell, but this igf-1 was that yes  How were the questions which what bad of an idea if I said this is a very current study igf-1 is is positively associated with poor longevity and not in the sense that you're going to die young. It's just that many organisms is a balance between when we are in stress days are we can't reproduce and we can grow states of the sort of Aging versus growth is sort of a trade-off that evolution bf1 is considered too much of that signaling is not as good for long-term Wellness, but it is probably subtle and that's a study that sang the most recent thing. Let me see what questions we have coming up here.  Okay, you spell asshole wrong know I couldn't increase the rate of tissue generation versus intake of Veggie, but I think the igf-1 is is is involved in a variety of different stress states that correlate with shorter longevity, but more wrote more robust activity, especially the kids are visual is weight training. For example, I don't know if that's I think that's a whole different thing. I always see Advertiser testicle and you can tell what food sensitivities you have. How accurate are they? And is it serious enough to change your diet the trouble is that if you go to an allergist, they're going to discover actual allergies and those are very important. And then if you go to if you buy a food sensitivity kit, which is not you know, usually antibody-based it can be different depending on the on the Sensitivity. I think another problem is  That an allergy and between being allergic and completely insensitive Foods. There's a very broad gray area of how people feel when they eat different diets and that's very individual and I've certainly don't have the expertise to tell you don't try this kid, but I do think that if you have to go to an allergist and pay them seven or eight hundred dollars for a test and you buy a $20 test on the internet. My dad used to say you get what you pay for and you have to wonder what is the quality of the information you're getting from a kit that you buy in operated home with no expertise for twenty bucks. So if I think it probably depends a lot on what's being tested, okay, why isn't it more likely to gluten sensitivity is more related to an individual's microbiome and is related to their own host response or inability to digest food the gluten sensitivity. That's for celiac disease is definitely an autoimmune Loop that happens in the intestine. It doesn't have a lot to do the micro bio. However things like like like five  Maps and even maybe gluten sensitivity passes through them and whether gluten sensitivity is some turn down version of that same inflammatory pathway or something completely different. Nobody knows you could be it could be this could be at the answers right here is microbiome. Okay.  My friend, I'm not going to say the name. My friend blank has really bad bowels. How would he know if he has IBS?  Stop eating fodmaps. Actually your friend Alex bite.  I can't believe I just did.  Your friend might try this is not a hard diet to do there are now many are products that tell you and you can get charts on the fob Maps. So this might really help your friend. Usually as I say IBS is chronic problematic bowel without any sort of mapping to an actual disease. So it's a very frustrating thing for people who have it.  What part of the Celiac by Kirsten Weir Weir important again, I will put that on the study list. Okay, even though you hate the study list. I can show you the highlighted sheets. I did two for every point on the everyone. I know you want me to put those online so you can look for the blank ones. This is insane ask you next. It's not true. But okay ready. I think we're done. Okay. Now we're going to talk about alcohol alcohol is a very very interesting because it is the only nutrient that is overtly psychoactive. You know, I mean people always say, oh chocolate, you know, all this tcc's reward pathway descriptions of you know, the of food and food addiction is a thing. It's a thing and there were even you know, programs geared towards food addiction that are a lot like addiction side gambling in an actual drugs that work the same way. However, alcohol is and despite the  Acted wine Nutz & microbrewery people will tell you it's all about the flavor if alcohol were in psychoactive. I do not think there be a wind industry or a micro brewing industry. That's just my dumb opinion, but I just don't believe it. I don't believe people would eat slightly rotten. Hops juice. If it didn't get you high. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. You can argue with me all you want but I just don't believe it anyway, so we're going to talk about alcohol. We're going to talk about some of its effects how it gets absorbed nutrition in SNS Wellness providers of the future most of the time you deal with people. They're going to have some sort of level of consumption, you know, it is it is a major part of our culture and our Commerce. Okay. So one of the things it's important is in alcohol is a major risk factor for mortality for overall mortality. This is actually a pretty dense charting. It might be worth.  Sing at it just out of your own interest for being to my I-9 meant to highlight. So you have high blood pressure can backhoe smoking and alcohol is a close third, you know, if you look at this disability-adjusted life-years and which is a sort of an epidemiological measure of adjusting lifespan to this you see that alcohol is pretty important. Now, it's it's key to know that there are lots of separate contributors. So these are all these components and some of them are, you know, some of them are consequences of Behavioral aberrations that occur, you know, when we now calls being used but but when you add them all up and is a major contributor to poor lifestyle and and and mortality and and disability, okay, so it's worth thinking about that but you will get out of the end of this is  What you'll get that is why do people drink so much don't you stop for second Rosie. We have a National Institute of alcohol abuse and alcoholism National Institutes are multibillion-dollar research funding institutions that spend all their time thinking about the National Institute of Aging is the National Institute of diabetes and digestive disorders and kidney Disorder. So there's a number of different ones. There's a whole separate one in this one called but these up here there's National Institute of alcohol abuse and alcoholism is also the National Institute of drug abuse and these are actually a pretty similar missions, but they've been divided because alcohol is so considerate so different from other psychoactive drugs interesting. So in the end and IAA  Actually, I should become niaa right that make a lot more sense u.s. College students per year in 2018 who died of alcohol-related causes C are in 600,000 or injured while drunk so you young people are resilient my arm back even even at UCSD. So this is this is me at uses. Even you said this is actually UCSD statistics from 2014. And so you can see that that we have 244 total alkaline sit-ins 23 of these were caused by a volume transport to local hospitals jails are county detox facility to deal with you. No problem. You can stay at the Sun God Festival, but don't leave. I'm going to drive you to jail.  Actually, I know people who who work the assertive is a Corral at the sun guard vessel for people who are too high, but they don't want to get them in trouble. So they just keep them all come down and see if there's a middle ground between getting in legal trouble and you know, and I'm getting hurt there's a it's about safety in and helping people learn better how to do these but then this is some of the local statistics so and then there's this whole other aspect of drinking Coke binge drinking and binge drinking is something like forty percent of u.s. College students participate in binge drinking. So the definition of four more drinks for women 5 or more for men in 2 hours.  In college, I think I fit this category on a regular basis and I'm glad I lived so if you drink 4 beers or four shots of whiskey that's that's a little binge and that will definitely affect you. So, you know, this is could lead to acute alcohol intoxication to death with several caveats will say so how is alcohol absorbed, you know, it's a very simple molecule that's  This is ethanol don't do it with one carbon. You'll go blind and absorbs easily into that got it doesn't even need to transport. It just goes right through some of the stomach some of the small intestine absorbs pretty quickly. You know, it just goes right in the bloodstream. And so this is actually at one of the ways to compare these things is a drink is 12. Oz of beer oz of malt liquor 5 oz glass of wine or a shot of whiskey 1.5 oz in all of these are about 14 G of ethanol since about 96 calorie. So already it's interesting to think about this if you have three or four beers with dinner and many people do that's 300 calories right there that you just added on top of whatever you're consuming now for you guys are probably why I know none of you drink cuz you're all under 21, but but  But people my age they do that several for five times a week 300 calories 5 times a week plus whatever they're eating time many years. It's not surprising that the average American gains about a pound a year from their late twenties on into their dotage in Owen and there's an any sources of cryptic calories in this is one of them, but we want to talk more about some of the other aspects of the real consequences of absorption besides the empty nutrient calories is the change in blood alcohol level is actually pretty amazing is is this is for males and females. This is two different scales because men have more water they are larger in stature and there's a metabolic differences. I'll tell you about the minute but for that reason these scales are a little different so this is the  this I'd let me change this this is the scale of blood BAC stands for blood alcohol concentration and this is a 1% .08 and the amazing thing is that legal in California .08 percent is a person 21 is the legal limit so that's for drinks of it for a for a male between 4 and 5 between 3 and 4 for a female effort stature so and then which I think is kind of interesting is it's it's much less for people are under 21 so if you're drinking illegal illegal limit is still there which is weird because it's illegal to drink why would there be a legal limit to drink but it's early, but I don't know what kind of comforting for Uber drivers and other passenger tires it's so your Uber drivers will be you know in the legal limit if they are drinking less than you are so  Coming you get into inviting you get into an Uber. Come on. Everyone knows after 9. Then your driver will be here and it's good. When and how much of this is actually from the from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. So this is actually a pretty information does thing so this is the amount of time from the first drink and this is a total drinks here and so it isn't hard to get above the legal limit depending on when it was so this is depending on this is the bigger you are the easier it is to absorb because the concentration is lower in a bigger volume and the small you are the time before drinking is is such so this is definitely a DUI and this is these are possible depending on a bunch of factors like the way you absorb it and how your metabolizing it in your tolerance and all that kind of thing.  Consequences of absorption are are are great. But the thing is absolutely amazing and it's not clear in the study is right here .02 percent is where you can demonstrate impairment with driving machines with driving simulators. So wave above the legal limit is way above that which is intriguing, you know, it makes you wonder why is it up here? And I think the answer is in jails would just be full of people cuz lots of people drink after a drink or two, but it's you are still impaired, you know to some extent and fortunately it doesn't have massive consequences that we can tell. Okay. These are the behavioral consequences and is basically is a gradual progression from great to horrible answer to what happens and the crazy thing about alcohol. Is it easy to drink quite a lot of it without noticing there's growing consequences.  Everyone has experienced the person is really drunk who becomes your best friend and you're glad that it keeps progressing until they pass out. But you know, so we have this make sure I have this fear.  So so, you know, these are the concentrations of this is no 5.5 around here. There are positive effects of what's interesting is the brain chemistry of it, which I have a else. Where is a pretty interesting in terms of brain region and what happens but in terms of nutrition what happens is metabolizes soap ethanol as first consumed and then it's betab allies and it turns out there's several really interesting features of a tablet of ethanol as it's being at 7 calories per gram is due to the fact that it can enter Main Street metabolism Envy use as an energy source. Okay, so this is so most of ethanol is metabolized in the in the liver and then some of its also metabolites in the gut and so this is basically two enzymes to get use alcohol dehydrogenase.  You will never make this mistake again.  Is there ethanol?  I'm just so thrilled to be using an eraser. That's for my delicate hands.  Exercising that right? Okay. So here's up at all.  Are you remember nadh or old friends and we go from NAD?  nadh  Abstracts and eat an H - and an H+. And so we go down oxidation state one to this aldehyde.  Now you don't have to be a toxicologist know that aldehydes are pretty nasty. They're very reactive to biomolecules. They're not good stuff. And so the next thing that happens is NAD is used Again by a different enzyme in the sink enzyme to make this friendly safe molecule.  Which is what is this?  Acetic acid its when acetylcholine is made from if you just attach it to Kauai. So this is acetate.  Are old friends easily metabolized can enter the Krebs cycle if it gets out of disco a this is acetaldehyde.  If molecule dismal should not have a big name like that. It just seems wrong and his staff at all.  Okay, and this is called aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase and this is how the high dehydrogenase or aldehyde dehydrogenase.  And this is the basic dub a metabolic pathway you report a major portion of this in this actually some pretty interesting features to this simple incredibly spry the simplest metabolic pathway you're ever going to learn. It's pretty simple. Okay, so there's actually an interesting for the guy thought this this cheery a happy-looking picture of people drinking and having fun and you know each other on a graphic you come to this PowerPoint often don't know sometime. So here we go is there we go at end one of the reasons. It's actually pretty interesting that includes which opposition number reasons why xx's I don't want to be too weird about gender but this is bio gender X X vs. X y u no other aspects of biology so much but xx's are more effective alconex wise because they have less body mass and so is same amount as you higher concentration xx's have less water more fat or lean muscle.  75% fat tissue is 50% water for body weight and acts this is actually really interest is xx's have less alcohol dehydrogenase in the stomach lining. So one of the things that the stomach lining directly metabolize alcohol to to this acetaldehyde in the stomachs of this alcalde drive me to Sears in the stomach as women, your stomach will metabolize about 10% of the alcohol gets consumed in men. It's about 30% So it's a substantially more from the get-go doesn't even get into the bloodstream. I thought was interesting and those three things combined. Okay, there are also some interesting. They're also some interesting variations for aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme comes into isoforms is one in the mitochondria to hear. Let's write things down is ADH  Nal dh12. Okay, and this is actually a pretty famous. This is almost as famous as to actually know the mutation is a glutamine 5042 a license with a particular mutation. It doesn't work very well and its present about 50% of East Asians and I even one copy will affect a person who has its ability to metabolize alcohol and they will get a fire buildup of acetaldehyde and get this flushed complexion that you can often see in people with that turned it off and runs in family. So you might be the wedding and everybody on one side of the aisle is red-eye my family, so that's cool. And it's not it's not problematic. It's just more physical but another interesting thing is aldehyde dehydrogenase is the target for a very crude inhibitor called disulfiram or and abuse it is given to alcoholics to dissuade them.  I'm drinking and the reason is unlikely in BL2. Isoform East Asians can have that causes a slight decrease in metabolism. Like I guess I could do this drug antabuse is completely shuts down aldehyde dehydrogenase. And so if you take that and then drink you will get incredibly sick. So it's just the stick model of alcoholism. If you drink with this drug in your system, you will get phenomenally L. I won't kill you, but it's very very unpleasant. So this is one approach a fairly crude approaching most alcoholic simply stop taking it and then drink the awesome power of denial and as Physicians you understand how nuts people are is I met a guy at an AA meeting we used to take his Daiso from tablets paint them with nail polish.  And take them so he was technically taking them but they wouldn't get broken down and he could drink is one rule that you can live by I have one rule. It's more important than fireman. An architect is one rule by which you can understand all of human behavior. You ready people are weirder than shit. It's just true. It's like amazing. It's the one thing that will fit every model of understand. There's an example. Okay, so there is a second he would make it no good for tomorrow's Physicians. There's another pathway is it called the Microsoft oxidizing system or any OS how many of you have heard of cytochrome p450  Awesome, that's nice to see the rest of you now do so cytochrome.  B450. I wonder where to hear about doctor check converse with him, but I don't know maybe you heard about it in ecology or something. But cytochrome p450 is a very large collection of enzymes it occupied the liver's microsomes the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver and their entire job is to oxidize things into hydroxylate many different molecules. And in fact, they think they do you think that humans have such a large number of them because we were a foraging people and inquisitive forging people that often tried eating you things. I needed some way to get us out of trouble. We ate the wrong thing and R&B Ender through Evolution. This is at least when humans have so many cytochrome p450 there are hundreds of ice that forms of this particular detoxifying enzymes in the human liver. It's quite remarkable anyway, so it turns out that this collection of enzymes are this type of enzyme Canales.  Be involved in in cytochrome p450 is also works at to take ethanol converted into acetyl-coa. Use NAD nadph is what's golden mix function oxidase. So you might think why would nadph oxidized leasing agent because they oxidized and reduced at the same time. So it's a pretty complicated entomology that we're not going to get into the fact is it in ADH is one of the sub penny D P age is one of the substrates was not a direct removal of a reducing equivalent from from ethanol these enzymes work different if they're called mix function oxidases and I'll be glad to talk to you about it more if you wanted something office hours to send me but the deal is at the net result is still acetaldehyde. Although there's a more complex collection of his oxygen is the ultimate electron except  So it's a little more complex. Okay, but the bottom line is those contribute as well and the interesting thing about these mix auction oxidizes. It's going to be 4:50 is their first of all sort of an overflow if you drink a lot and you're out of the hide your alcohol dehydrogenase is over swamp the ethanol metabolizing cytochrome system can kick and also the mifepristone the system you can what's even more interesting is if you drink chronically so people who drink a lot have induced version. So one of the things about the cytochrome p450 enzymes in this is observed in many different drugs that have been given to animals and humans is that they in do they called the drugs are substrates cause the induction of the enzyme through Pathways that are not that well understood sometimes sometimes they are and so someone who drinks chronically will have a highly induced MicroCell methanol oxidizing system and they will be more capable of doing it than other people. This is part of the contribution to alcohol tolerance someone who drinks a lot  And frequently will be able to drink a lot more than someone who has never had alcohol before and that's partially due to enhance metabolism and other things as well. So the ambient but another thing about any OS is part of the cytochrome p450 enzyme crew that metabolize a lots of other drug so you can have different interactions between ethanol and other drugs are metabolized by the same system breaks down into started to category. So we're going to I want to give you a little bit of a background. This is sort of basic pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetics is a fancy word for just meeting the rate of drug availability.  How can addicts?  Phonetics just means the rate of things happening. This is drug related to this is the rate that drug concentrations change in the blood the way they appear and disappear. So big part of pharmacokinetics is this is absorption. And then this is distribution of the tissue out of the bloodstream and and metabolism. And so they're these cool terms of area under the curve is the total exposure in these These are pharmacokinetic is if a drug is being metabolized by an enzyme system and that enzyme system is being affected by another drug. They can enter play at that level. Okay. So ethanol this two different thing number 1 some drugs are metabolized by the exact same enzymes that the ethanol some terrible Lies by so drinking can block can block the metabolism other drugs and increase their concentration above what's expected. Okay. So I'm so alcohol and drug interactions. When is it the drug in the ethanol a competitive inhibitor compete with each other for the same enzyme. So if you're drinking a lot that drug can have a higher level.  So one of the observations is there and their deactivation to be inhibited by ethanol. Now, the main reason sedatives are bad for the central nervous, but there's also a contributory metabolic effects. Okay. I may be the more subtle Hobbs. I mean that's pretty obvious. If you have a bank full of people in a few tellers, you're going to compete for the same colors, but alcohol drug interactions that can enhance metabolism happiness ways people who drink a lot having do cytochrome p450 and doe systems are able to metabolize other drugs some people who chronically induce there any OS system are able to metabolize drugs to effectively and one particularly intriguing example of this is a drug called acetaminophen is one of these old school anti-inflammatories and too much metabolism of acetaminophen can actually be very toxic is one of the major causes of drug causes of drug-induced liver disease.  In people, so having a highly induced oxidation system can cause problems with either getting rid of drugs to quickly. We're generating toxic by-products. Okay. So the most important aspects of ethanol though, I think are the ones the effects it has on the brain and those effects are the interesting thing is it works gradually Works in words from good Effect 2 bad effect. The first affects run the cerebral cortex. That's the highest functioning part of the brand new ones that they create social networks and interactions in the ability to communicate with each other and to appreciate each other and do all those things. And so this is sort of the place where people go near awesome man Chanel. Can I hug you like that kind of thing and then down here we have the forebrain which is a little bit, you know more basic functions, but includes a very important part of the brain called the hippocampus which is about encoding extrinsic memory. And one of the features that people will see with ethanol is what's called an alcoholic blackout and alcohol.  Blackouts are surprisingly common. They happened to lots of people and some of you as you party May notice this that you will sometimes the next day. If you've drunk too much. I'm not recommending this. Don't try this at home. If you'd be the best way to put it cuz you're saying is you will not remember what happened and there are you if you meet people who actually have problems with drinking they can tell you are raising stories about alcoholic blackouts cuz often people emerged from in the middle of doing something. I've met. I know one neurosurgeon. This is he's in recovery now, thank God woke up out of an alcoholic blackout while doing a brain surgery. He was doing over and he did good and patient was fine. Cuz one of the krays I deserve mean I'm not a real. This is a true story and it is one of the reasons that this gentleman got sober is cuz he said this is fun.  And by some miracle the people Austin come out of a blackout in the middle of driving and I'll be driving down the highway and say Where am I in so, you know that there's this is a real thing and it's due to an inability to encode memories. Although function is I mean, you're highly impaired but you're not unconscious is very crazy. You know, it's one of the things that you always dreaded Hearing in college was last night. Anyways, why you don't ya  it's never good. No wonder what you wrote the most beautiful poem.  And you read it to a bar full of people crying never never. Okay. So but those days are long over and then the cerebellum is an even deeper part of the brain in this is involving, you know things like movement in head balance. So when the police test you for, you know your ability to walk a straight line. They are looking to see how well the cerebellum is doing. Can you keep your balance on that means someone is very imperative in finally be deep brain stem and this these are all this year are things like breathing and heart rate. So this is where real lethal alcohol toxicity happened but importantly waiting for alcohol toxicity happens. You have all sorts of possibilities for huge problems, like waking up on the on the wheel of a car or you know, etcetera. So, you know, this is it is interesting that this is such a popular drug and it is so easy to get into trouble with it. Okay. So this is that's also that's so clinical. This is so clinical. Here's a better way six pack of beer.  Acting silly everyone loves you.  6 Margaritas, you're out of the silliness a bottle of tequila. You going to have to dial in. Let's talk a little about excessive drinking but also of the definitions cuz you will encounter people who were this is the root of their pathology. You only have lots of people like this and then also some of the metabolic consequences of that is so excessively includes binge drinking and heavy drinking and any drinking by pregnant women are people younger than 20 watt. Now that would be considered excessive and it depends on social cultural aspects of it. I think my mom actually continue to drink lightly throughout her gestation of Me Maybe Next fix planetary. I don't know I should sue my mom always she's gone. Nevermind Okay, so  Each day is precious heavy drinking is defined as consuming for women 8 or more drinks per week than 15 or more drinks per week. And again, I think that's the borderline cuz you meat people have a couple drinks every night. You can do side recommendation is what they say. So what are the nutritional facts of alcohol that one of the interesting things and you can actually give this a lot of thought is when you metabolize ethanol it purely drives the production of nadh is the thing that has to happen. Yes, the Microsoft will system doesn't do that, but the microsystem stops here and then I need each produces produced by the next one. And also most of the metabolism ethanol. Is this pathway like seventy 80% of it for normal people so you can imagine it having lots of nadh  We have a number of different facts, you know from your thinking about metabolism. So it impairs absorption its first of all, it's too many empty calories and not any nutrients know even in a good hoppy IPA or whatever it is. I don't know what those beers are called. But you know, there's certain nutrients and starts. I know a lot of Runners who love to drink a few beers after a raised cuz it replenishes there carbs in Timnath Co better but most of it's just these empty calories in pears absorption metabolism retention of key vitamins and minerals at the level of the gut. This is really interesting. It blocks gluconeogenesis anything. Why would a Black Lagoon in Genesis? And the reason is that a very large of nadh in the cytosol of pyruvate to lactate from pyruvate to lactate and back. So if you've allowed any DH you generate a lot of Lactaid and you limit the availability of pyruvate, this is one of the reasons that when you're metabolizing a large  Amount of ethanol you can become hypoglycemic like if you go to sleep after drinking and you have your metabolism a lot of ethanol and you haven't eaten much and unique gluconeogenesis that can contribute to the bad feeling the next day not enough to make anyone drink but it can contribute and it's also a alcohol to diuretic that causes dehydration and may contribute to Hangovers or I will say The Hangover complicated neurological phenomena. No one really understands that would be great. If they did you can make a billion dollars if you could actually figure out how to stop a hangover except for like morphine is not clear, but the really are pretty acute and people will experience them and it has no it's not problematic. I see near that's not by threatening about a promise the real problems come with long term consumption of ethanol at high levels of heavy drinking for a long time. And if you become clinicians, this is something  Depending on your specialty you will observe you'll definitely observe it in your clinical rotations as you go through different departments. And if you're a family practice doctor or an internal medicine or an emergency room doctor you're going to see these kind of things and so the liver like always is the main player in a lot of this detoxifying metabolism partially because of the first pass effect where the blood goes right to the liver from the intestine. Also, it's the site of all these metabolic enzymes can do this. And so what ends up happening is a run this pathway you're in heaven and you're also inhibiting speaker glycolysis takes NAD and nadh if you think about it, she really shunting glucose into fat production, you're stunting and your shunting is silicon a production. So you get a really high Tennessee to make fat to generate chat. Are you also calorically rich in terms of the availability of the energy here. So, you know you you're in a sort of a weird anabolic State and so  Return to get liver a fatty liver disease. In fact, this is interesting. There's a very popular type of disease called Nash you'll study is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. And this is a fancy word for a fatty liver steatosis is a buildup of things like stearic acid in fat and it's so alcoholism is so, that you have to distinguish alcoholic steatohepatitis is from the other types because people who drink a lot will have fatty livers and you have to figure out whether it's some sort of metabolic disorder or that they're drinking a lot. Okay. So basically what happens is alcoholic you get in progression first to get fatty liver disease, which is steatosis caused by alcohol and sit and that's basically cuz you're driving fat synthesis inhibitor and glucose metabolism.  Then alcoholic beverages eventually cause what's called alcoholic hepatitis in which there's an inflammatory state from tissue damage driving metabolism inappropriately depositing a lot of unsaturated fatty acids are synthesized and then finally give you an alcoholic cirrhosis, which is an advanced stage liver disease in which probably that person will need a liver transplant or they will that have an early demise and Dish the view of a cirrhotic liver is pretty incredible. It is really a damaged organ. And remember the liver is one of the very few organs that can regenerate. So this is in the face of its attempts to regenerate you still have these problems and then there are long-term consequences of cirrhosis that are really problematic in the clinic but there are other effects of excessive drinking too. So there's a higher incidence of heart failure again due to fatty build-up in the heart and excess fat being made there's brain damage, you know, not not  100000 brain cells last night. It's not an acute toxin is a gradual effect on on the tissue as far as anyone can tell and then certain cancers are increase their breast cancer 50% off from 3 or more drinks a day South pretty heavy drinking but three or more drinks a day is something people will do is Remy National Cancer Institute of study liver stomach and colon cancer and then oropharyngeal cancer is particularly intriguing as one of the things people like to do is go and smoke and drink right like not any of you but so far bars at are places where people like to smoke and drink and so if you have the orange oropharyngeal cancers are kind of throat cancers non-smokers they get if you drink 30 drinks a week, which is quite a lot that's like for you know for a day that's like four or five beers for five shots of liquor day that someone is getting getting buzzed every single day. So they probably have certain stressors in their life for addictions.  But that's in five or six bolt increase heavy smoker Sevenfold and their multiplicative so don't drink and smoke choose one. I would suggest drinking if you have to and then there is a such thing as fetal alcohol syndrome as far as anyone can tell the idea that there is crack infants is false and probably not true that was in a sort of a socially promulgated thing to create fear and socio-cultural just waiting but maybe that's wrong to it hasn't been clear that the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a lot of Developmental disorders. Basically. The alcohol is a teratogen is a word.  minion costume  causes birth defects are things are caused caused defects during embryogenesis. And there's actually a number of different facial features that come this is a description of them. But the real major problems are a mental mental delay. Okay. So this causes Friday fetal alcohol syndrome mental delay with impaired nerve and immune function. So there's a number of different epidemiologically observed cases like this. It's also the leading known cause of mental disability in the west. So, you know meaning has so many people. This is actually closer to cultural cultural shift towards disapproval publicly voiced disapproval of her pregnant. People drinking. That's probably a good thing. You know, I mean, I don't know how it's delivered to people but that's a good thing. OK on the other hand. I don't want to leave you thinking this is beneficial.  Stick social lubricant mean my view is the people who can safely alter their state of consciousness should and people who can't must not and I've done that controls. There's obvious benefits of you know, what a beverage like that that alters the psyche at the cerebral cortex level, but there's also apparently one drink a day or every every other day be on this is a kind of measures actually decreases incident incidence of heart disease by 20 to 40% That's really interesting. You know, who knows what the heck is maybe if you were more relaxed person you're less stressed. Maybe it actually is biochemical effects. This isn't easy to tease out and red wine has antioxidants in this is the vectors A very famous Molly Google Resveratrol that's in red wine before you think that helps you have to drink about 2,000 cases of Resveratrol the day to get the amount in a capsule.  You take as a supplement self probably that's not the route to go. So I will see you all on Thursday and we will be telling your test up today.  Anyone from the presentation group?  Miss you more people.  San Diego podcast "
