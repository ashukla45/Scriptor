    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast. All rights, welcome everyone  Nice to see all of you. I'm hoping this is bibc 120 now. Okay good. Thank you off to a meeting this weekend. So I'm filling in for to lectures thing that was on the syllabus. I'm happy to do that. I talk to scores from 2006 to 2017 11 years and a retired last year.  And we're fortunate to have his Hampton take it over. It's very hard to get a research faculty to teach this course. I thought of her those 11 years and Professor Hampton is taking over the Baton. He's got a lot of experience and wealth of knowledge about chemistry and Physiology and wellness and health. So that's great to have him teaching this course, so hopefully I won't be too many bumps in the road. This is first time through so he's working it getting a sea legs so to speak  The one of those also don't think we're fortunate about is I certainly feel fortunate or thankful is that all of you are here and the reason is because I feel myself the nutrition and health and wellness is one of the most important things you can learn when you're in college or throughout life now, it's not because I think so, but the reason I say that is because of the following study that got published in Lancet and Jama just point out quick things here this week the protein lecture Doctor Hampton will pick up after he comes back. So that's one that was supposed to come before but arranging schedule and so here are the subjects that we're covering tooth today and on Thursday.  So this is the study of mentioning why I think the attrition is so important. This was a largest study that I know of it was ever done looking at the risk factors and risk factor clusters that affect death and disability around the world. It involved.  Over 500 researchers 300 institutions in 50 countries. This was a mammoth effort and they looked at what were these risk factors that had the biggest impact on our lives? And so what do they find? So I'm going to hone in on United States and when normally was kind of studies done. What comes up top is tobacco smoking was usually the biggest cause of death and disability and the data for United States in 1990 and 2010. Tobacco. Dietary risks are now number one in the United States as a risk factor for death in the United States.  Heads and shoulders above everything else. So it's not only an important factor that impacts our health and well-being. It is the most important factor that will affect your health and well-being. And so I thank you for being here and taking your time to learn what this risk factor is and what we can do to help our fellow Americans our fellow a family members and Friends deal with this most important risk for health and wellbeing.  So today's lecture is a continuation of the series on macronutrients. You've already got carbohydrates, right and you're going to get proteins after this and then we're going to talk about lipids today in the next day or so. What was the main take-home in terms of health and wellness in terms of carbohydrates, which carbohydrates what type of carbohydrates should we be avoided or that Americans are getting too much in their diets.  Go to the ladder.  Animal certified simple carbohydrates good and what's another way of saying a simple carbohydrates sugars are particularly fructose has the most is worse than liquid sugar and the nutritionist call it added sugar not sugar present already in fruits and vegetables but added sugar by processing is the one number one carbohydrate we should be avoiding Americans are getting too much. What is the form of carbohydrate that we should be striving to get we should improving.  Complex carbohydrates. Okay another name?  Starch. Yeah, that's good. That's good. There's another name that came up in just like shirt.  Let It Go, okay, I like that actually has a terrible example but I like your idea of a Whole Foods have the least degree figurines in one of the healthiest food you can eat lettuce is not one of those shooting original price for Gladys is basically a mouthful of water. So it doesn't provide what other vegetables provide that are specially is the second most limiting nutrient in the American diet. What is that  Fiber. Okay. Good. Okay. So fiber is what we should be gravitating towards Foods whole foods that contain fiber and avoiding the sugars in monosaccharides.  So now we're going to move into lip is which also has a big impact and the material he was probably some of the most dense you can find in the whole course is a lot of stuff here, but it's for an important reason cuz this is one of the things that has a huge impact on her health and well-being, but also it's one of the most controversial  Just an example front cover of Time Magazine and 84 cholesterol is bad. Brownie face with two eggs is okay 2014 scientist label fat the enemy why they were wrong. So now it's okay to eat butter and fat and then Professor Hampton just gave you a paper that came out with last month. It was epidemiological study that looked at eggs and found that a half an egg a day increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and dying. Okay. So what the heck is going on and what can we learn from our cover this as we go through the electric most in the second half, but I got to give you quite a bit of background before we can talk about it intelligently.  Okay. Now first of all fats and lipids are the most calorie-dense remember carbohydrates are fresh me for kilocalories per gram lipids are more than double that for 9 kg per gram now in the past many centuries ago people thought that fat was just a source of calories. It was nothing essential about it now was based on feeding studies take some animals. You feed him a fat-free diet totally dispensable, right? It didn't need it for your for your health and well-being. However, the problem was the 18th and 19th century is that the techniques to remove the fat and lipids weren't as rigorous as they were in the 20th century those foods that they thought were fat fee had some contaminating fat in it was until the beginning of the twentieth century. They are able to rigorously remove all the lipids from the diet.  and  these two people burned Burgers George Berg into papers in JBC 1929-1932 are actually able to remove all the lipids from the diet that they fed rats and they ask what happened and what they found was extraordinary totally Paradigm busting for growth inflammation of the skin kidney damage and premature death.  Actually fats were essential if you completely removed it. Now what this experiment allow them to do which was so cool is that they can add back individual components because who knows what fat lipid in that complex diet that these animals were getting was responsible. Was it all responsible? Was it one particular one? Was it several? So they added back individual fatty acids to these routes and asked did any of them recover their help reverse the for growth early premature death and so forth and what they found was one fat linoleic acid omega-6 fatty acid was the one just one that could restore their help while saturated fatty acids stearic acid did not this was the discovery of essential fatty acids these papers and they discovered the first one it turns out there's a second one called them to make it 3  Okay. Now I'm starting to throw out a lot of turns. So I'm going to back up a little bit. I don't even heard of Mega 6 in mega threes. How do you know what those are?  Show me the back way. Yeah, what is it refer to?  Good came first the position of a double box. Let's do a quick review to get up to speed so I can throw out these terms at these the physiologist chemist positions used with ease and you'll be able to follow. Okay. So nomenclature on fatty acids saturated fatty acid is one that contains no double Bock fatty acids have a long aliphatic tails hydrophobic and hydrophilic carboxyl Group, which is what we call the head room. That is also called the carboxyl and is called the Alpha and the methyl in down here at the end of The aliphatic. Shane is either called Omega or the end group. Okay. So we talked about Mega fatty acids were talking about counting from this and carbon here. This is a common fatty acid present in a lot of animal food stearic acid. Nomenclature is important is c a number of coal.  Add another number first number refers to the number of carbons the second one refers to the number of double bonds stearic acid is 1800.  Single double bond monounsaturated fatty acid. Here's an example oleic acid must have been a fatty acid in olive oil. This is responsible for a lot of the health properties of this fatty acid. Don't use that too much when you make it in single double bond.  And so you have 18 carbons 18 colon one cuz it's one double bond. One two, three, four, five six. Seven eight nine first double bond appears. It's nine carbons from the methyl end. So when I say 18:1 Mega 9, this is the structure you would be able to dry out that's called oleic acid.  It's very important one and diet.  If you put another number bond in we now enter the polyunsaturated.  Two or more double bonds. Here's another important 118 to 18 carbons two double bonds unsaturated and it's called animagus 6 because the first double bond is at the Omega 6 position 1 2 3 4 5 6  So if I said it's two double bonds with the first one to make a 6 you can draw the structure based on that.  Now this second and outer double bonds follow a very specific pattern see all you need to know is where the first one is so we can draw out all the rest.  Now remember in organic chemistry when you have a conjugated double bond.  Tank with a pipe electrons.  Okay could resonate with each other the double bond you find in fatty acids are not conjugated. They skip a carbon.  And then go to the next car.  Double bond two single Bonds in a double bond, so they're not conjugated. That's the rule. So if you have a carbon double bonds, that's the the pattern that they will follow.  Sorry about that.  Go ahead and Silas set.  I like crickets as you can hear.  Okay.  Okay. So this is lintelek. That's the essential fatty acid that the first discovered certain vegetables have lots of the mega $6 won other essential fatty acid that the birds did not discover because it was needed in lot lower levels and it retained much more readily in the body and that's going to make this to make it three here alpha-linolenic. We now know that this is another essential fatty acid, but it's an omega-3 is a polyunsaturated and has three double bond 83, but the first one that position 3 skip  Is very abundant in flaxseed oil?  flexit that's why I love people like that slacks and sometimes she okay, so that's it for the  trigger some neurons release tablets mobile connections  Okay, so space-filling model just to show that the more unsaturated the more kinky it gets and that has relevance for the fact that it means it has a lower.  melting point  so fats tend to be saturated. So here's a triglyceride. This is a glycerol molecule. See more pictures of this in the second traded no double bonds. It's solid at room temperature boils often found in plants have double bonds. They don't pack as well. And so they're liquid at room temperature. So it takes call the temperature to solidify them.  That's in the triglyceride form.  Okay fellow practical sense. It was kind of interesting things about the Stables composition as defined as saturated monounsaturated polyunsaturated make a 6in to Megan. Here's the end nomenclature. So you can replace the ends with Omega here and general patterns that I want you to see first of all, the plant-based oils peanut oil and so forth are pretty low is his degree in saturated fatty acids and more prevalent have more unsaturated some have more Manos like Olive Oyl some have more police like sunflower oil and corn oil just depends. Here's how to make it three compound alpha-linolenic acid a huge amount very unusual for a plant origin, but that was very significant.  Got another one set up a lots of green here are mostly animal-based so butter and lard and so forth.  But look at these ones at the bottom here safely. This one here sold as very healthy yogurts ice cream so forth.  Look at the amount of saturated fat in coconut oil Scott 50% more than butter and almost double lard.  Turn the fatty acid composition you'd be better eating gelato or lard. Then you would be coconut oil based ice cream. So you just have to read the label look at the amount of saturated fats. And so you see there's a lot and coconut oil.  Cactus huge amounts and coconut oil is an interesting.  Okay, so  we're going to get into little bit about metabolism quick review metabolism.  But that's important for regulation in the health impacts of these things. Okay. So here's glycerol with Three fatty acids years has fatty acids. Fatty acids can be removed by oxidation being degraded in the in the South the higher-order types of metabolic transactions occur. When these Ester Bond or triglycerides this ride bond is formed between a fatty acid and glycerol and he get three of them. You got to try it by glyceride here. So when you add the fatty acids to glycerol, that's when you strip them off clear this Bond Ester Bond and release the fatty acids. That's done by lipase.  Near the very important enzymes because they're one of the targets of regulations affecting targets of pharmaceuticals that are involved in diet aids. So decoration of fatty acids glycerol ester of triglycerides.  Glycerol is stripped off by the Light bases in a glycerol that enters glycolysis and then I'll remember those two pyruvate and then enters the Krebs cycle fatty acids transported into the mitochondria. Where are they get broken down by beta oxidation to acetyl coenzyme a is critical in metabolism is also critical in nutrition. It is 1 / most important Hub in metabolic transactions, when you do with a chemistry and nutrition Chick-fil-A nutrition that's has a lot of things that can converge on that and that branches out into a lot of different things comes up over and over and over example pyruvate oxidation, then that enters the TCA cycle and you get to your oxidative phosphorylation, so  Got transported into mitochondria and that transports process needs the compound call carnitine degradation strips off to carbon units at a time in a process called beta oxidation producing acetyl coenzyme a and that's degraded in TCA cycle.  There's a beta oxidation don't have to memorize the steps that all you just want to see that stripping off of the two carbon. So here's a longer fat acid dehydrogenase hydrated oxygen oxidized by lysis and there's your acetyl coenzyme a day just ripped off. So degradation of fatty acids are two carbon step to do some energy in the form of nadh and fadh2.  Okay, so I suspect you're probably seen that in your body chemistry, but I don't really emphasize it the actual steps nutrition. However, you need to remember what beta oxidation is so that if a schnoor what it does for control of it, you'll have it pictured. It's in the mitochondria. It's Walton box of data reduction sauce evolved in oxidation of fatty acids in a produce energy and acetyl coenzyme a  Synthesis of fatty acids, it's also very important in controlling your health and Physiology as the pretty complicated looking slide. So let me just simplify to the points that I want you to know and this is probably the most important step right? This is the most important step. You've got to see what's going on here.  Like degradation you strip off two carbons at a time synthesis adds two carbons at a time.  And that's involved that entails taking acetate making acetyl coenzyme a and then that seal group gets added to the growing fatty acid chain. So you had two carbons at a time.  That's why most of the fatty acids are even numbers is that sell their synthesized complex this small kill around and supports all these provides the fresh out of the past platform for these reactions. What unique about the fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol and acetyl coenzyme a gets a carboxyl group as a CO2 to make this three carbon compound called Millennial Quincy, MA.  This is Kate. You should see why an adjuster in a minute to the fatty acid synthesis.  Can the weather reasons this is so important. It's the rate-limiting step and it's the target.  Regulators major physiological regulation  Is one paper that really describes nice to science in 2006.  Which one of the places where lipid metabolism is regulated how much lipid you make?  Now when you take in food, but they've taken carbohydrates. What signal goes up in the blood.  Sorry was that in the body shifts into an anabolic state where wants to synthesize large storage molecules and other words lay on fat?  And the way it does that is insulin activate ACC and that launches accelerates fat production so that you can store these calories that are coming in on the diet.  Now if you have the reverse you start to fast what you want to do want to start using your storage pools to survive. Otherwise you would die because you don't have any energy come in. So if you don't want to make that do you want to make lipids? So ACC gets shut down ACC inhibition  What is the very key point of Regulation that's integrating signals from anabolic and catabolic states of the body food food intake versus starvation or lack of food fasting and that's all happening at this first step here in this pathway the rate-limiting step which would make sense. But is a cell with the Target that signaling molecules are the science article does a great job in describing started Duplin spend the time here today to talk about it. But know this is the Target and food intake and a high energy intake activates it so you store more fat fasting I shut it down.  Guess I think this is a summary side synthesis of fatty acids occurs in the cytosol. You had two carbons at a time using Mal meal coenzyme a fatty acid synthase as well as some molecules nadph did mention if an ACL carrier protein latches onto the growing of fatty acid and hold onto it in this fatty acid synthesis and the ACC that enzymes  That's it take and what you need to remember as we move into the nitty-gritty on lipids about the synthesis.  Okay. Alright. So this thing is turning away happily making all this fact that you don't want on your hips and thighs and your stomach and whatever you want. Okay start to make all this in the South and the initial product. So how when is it stopped keeps adding to Carvins you can go on indefinitely just make c100. Stops at c16 palmitate you could ignore this talk to Hampton will guide you on what you need to know for the exam. I should have struck that off. Now if you want to go further, you have to invoke and use along Aces and the chachere's  So let's look at those molecules. Okay. So this is the palmitic acid dipalmitate ac1600 saturated fatty acid that is the end product of the saracens ace cycle. Now, if you want to go something like linoleic acid linoleic and I'll medic asking cuz it's two extra carbons and there's two extra double bonds.  So the ads to extra carbons you have an enzyme called The Long gaze that adds those two extra carbons.  Dad has double bonds. You have enzymes called the saturation and they add the double bonds. This is that essential fatty acid.  Okay.  Now why is this essential?  In our diet, why would we die or early has Kimmy damaged if we didn't eat this in our diet?  The reason is is because our desaturation switch or adding these double bonds will only go as far from the carboxyl and to what's the disposition here. So the carboxyl and is alpha position. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 you can only go as far as as far as our desaturates is can go and all that could make is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Mega 9 fatty acid.  It can't make the cat make a mega sixes and we can't make Mega threes because artifacts races can't reach far enough to add those double bonds so we can make a we have to consume in our diet. So make it treason to make it six is fatty acids are essential in our diets because we can't decide to race is can't make so algae and other organisms have those desaturation and they can make them.  So the two essential fatty acids Dimension is linoleic acid 18 to make a Sex and alpha-linolenic acid 18 + 3.  Now why they made these two names so similar, I have no idea. They have done an enormous to service to all nutrition students at all time to put these two so close together. We just have to memorize States fortunately. This is sometimes called La in this is called a la maybe that's helpful for you. Just have to memorize these two very similar name knowing that one is in a mega 3 and once in the mega six essential in our diet.  I just to show you flax is very high and that'll make it three.  and  and salmon is also pretty high. So I sought after fish and they make a 6S or vegetable oil have a lot of the purple ones. They make a 6S.  That's if you're getting lots of plant-based foods that usually not a problem to get enough of these essential fatty acids.  So now we're going to talk about why.  These are essential what role do they play? Why do we have to have them?  Okay, so first of all these  What were going to call short chain fatty acids these molecules off the little lamp Clinic are converted into longer chain critical essential fatty acids.  The play very important roles in the body. Do you make a 6 family make arachidonic acid and then I got three family make DHA and EPA.  Have these are critical for all sorts of things and let me just show you a little bit more detail.  What's involved linoleic 6 as a desaturase along gason a dispatcher Ace to add two carbons and two double bonds. So we start with 18 to end up a 20-4.  Linolenic acid gets converted to arachidonic acid to memorize these individual steps.  hear that doctor Hampton  But I want you to show you that these are give examples to be long Aces and desaturation. Okay, and then alpha-linolenic has a few more to make this first EPA logo, 21832 a 25t saturation the elongation desaturation and then another elongation desaturation to produce DHA 22-6. Alpha-linolenic acid goes to EPA and that gets converted to DHA.  Because these molecules are the precursors for very significant signaling molecules in the cell. It took many decades for people to realize this for example people knew about aspirin in the 19th century was until they discovered prostaglandins and inflammation. Naturally this eventually the pathway would actually figuring out what aspirin did from collagically in ourselves. Okay. So here's the EPA and arachidonic acid. There's enzymes places and life oxygenases that involved in the synthesis of eicosanoid compounds make a 65 eicosanoids.  So they divided into two classes. These pathways are quite complex.  You look me up if you want. We're about what we need to know in this class. What you do need to know is this is the views of the precursors and what you end up as he's signaling molecules called that involve Cox cyclooxygenase has and hypoxia Genesis. Okay. Now it's just needed for app and promote blood clotting and they promote inflammation.  You make it three does the opposite for most blood thinning and anti-inflammatory?  That's very important properties of these are opposite for the yin and yang of the essential fatty acids promote clotting.  antagonize aquatic promotes inflammation tagging eyes inflammation  there's another way of looking at the  omega-6 class arachidonic acid is converted into these eicosanoids and these eicosanoids are further broken down into broken down into blood clotting factor from boxing and prostaglandins.  And these are the cycle oxygenases that are part of these Pathways of conversion.  So if you have a heart condition  would this be supportive or detrimental you a to make a 60?  omega-6 fatty acids  I want to go to fight detail about what promotes heart disease and atherosclerosis, but let me just put out a teaser. You start thinking about it.  So what happens in a heart attack?  What happens to a coronary artery when you have a heart attack?  So  This promotes blood clotting.  No, I wouldn't be helpful. Are you going to do the opposite?  Now pain and inflammation. Are you suppose you're fighting off infections are doing tissue reconstruction.  Gastric protection is important to protect the lining of the stomach.  So what are the key drugs that has been developed centuries ago? But then more modern where is the NSAIDs play work to decrease inflammation and pain is a block these Cox enzymes and prevent the synthesis of these prostaglandins.  So if I had an inhibitor of Cox Cox one into which aspirin is and I block the production of these prostaglandins and from boxing's these eicosanoids. I'm going to inhibit blood clotting.  That's why doctors sometimes quite often actually prescribe aspirin for people who have heart conditions. So they don't have his risk of a heart attack. This is blocking the production of  Information and pain okay to take aspirin when your heart inflammation also turns out to contribute to cardiovascular disease see that later so I can also help there.  Whatever you take a medicine is usually side effects and what side effect would you encounter if you took aspirin?  Are you going to damage the stomach and that's the biggest issue of chronic aspirin or NSAIDs consumption internal bleeding ulcers are also involved in protecting the stomach and you and Hibbett that protective quality those protective compounds when you take aspirin if that's the drawback so cardiologist.  Actually thinking about recommending that everybody over 50 or whatever will be taking baby aspirin, but they discovered that too many people are starting to get ulcers stomach problems intestinal problems and that led to early death in some cases. So the risk-to-reward ratio wasn't high enough because of this issue so they backed off and they're now saying only recommend it to people who have if that's the last I heard is that they recommended people have heart conditions that had a heart attack and not the general population.  questions so far  Is the Flasher comes fast and furious, I want this a little as you can see a lot of critical stuff in here that don't want you to leave you behind.  So this is kind of review.  What's interesting?  Felt so you got to know if you can write this down decreases inflammation response.  She was on the previous flight.  Yeah, okay. That's weird Okay, so  so I'm going to have to  read this to you cuz I didn't come out. I'll text too many too many different word versions. Okay. So this the next slide is the sexy coming out screwy in my screen as well. Let me see it.  It looks better.  Hey up there. You can see it. Okay that mode.  So this is what it looks like in your slides. Can you see how it's okay? Okay. So this is kind of a summary. Okay. I'm trying to summarize just what I told you the main concept contain prostaglandin in blood clotting from boxing. Okay. So these are the downstream molecules that are produced by the Cox and type oxygenases from the EPA and arachidonic acid 6 class also called group 2 from arachidonic Acid increase blood clotting and increase inflammatory response has a group 3 decrease blood clotting and decrease inflammatory responses. Okay, well as problems issues about that and a lot of the benefits that people fought in these massive clinical trials that they tried from fish oils. Never didn't pan out quite a bit disappointed.  However, these still conclusion still stand. These are the properties that these classes of eicosanoids have on our system.  Hopefully we'll get back to you.  Okay, so that's arachidonic acid.  Which class is that?  make sex and EPA  I said make it 3, right? Okay. So there's one of them three I haven't talked about that's DHA. That's the one that's converted by a long-ass and 80 saturates from EPA EPA gas converted to DHA. This is also very significant to make it three longer chain fatty acid.  Okay, this one turns out to be important for the brain. I and heart function. Now, there's massive amounts of this compound found in the retina. And in the brain like 20 to 25% of the fatty acids in our brain is DHA and if somebody is really deficient in DHA.  The brain get smaller. Is that massive? So you think something that has such a big component in these parts of her body in the retina and in the brain that it would play turns out it does it also plays an important role in the heart. So it protects cells in the heart and lower risks of lethal arrhythmia. So the irregular heartbeats, this is a process that it also protects the brain decreases risk of dementia from this paper here slows the loss of mental function and even protects the size of the brain.  So it helps the brain the eye and the Heart.  I don't know about you, but that's pretty important to me. I want to protect those tank. Okay?  Okay. So where do we find the mega threes and food sources fish now the shorter chain alpha-linolenic quite a bit in flex, but that's got to get converted into the EPA and DHA. Do you want to get the EPA and DHA directly? You need an animal source and Sam and turns out to be the best Anchovies and sardines are also very good summer not so good. So this is why the American Heart Association recommends two servings of fish a week.  Problem if your vegetarian but you can get it from other sources now, there is a problem and it's never spoken of whenever you see that recommendation thrown out. I never see a little ask risk caution. What should you be cautious about Siri eating Mercury and then else.  Mercury's big slick  organic pollutants lots of things accumulate nasty. Okay, and then our oceans are becoming the planets sewer. And so a lot of us going to end up in the fish and fat soluble compounds which can be toxic again up in the in the fat of these fish. Let me just give you one example of a report from an environmental toxicology and chemistry in 2010, which look at tuna commonly eaten fish Dixie by children described in this paper and then looked at the parts for parts per million concentration of mercury either in the form of white tuna, which is the greater. They should have done the opposite of sparse white should have been the white tuna and I would like to that would have been fun, but they did the opposite and junk like, okay.  And what they found is point three parts per million point for 26.5 for this 30.64.  So how important is that? Okay, so it's got a little mercury any big deal. Well, it depends on which regulatory agency you believe the EPA has a safety limit of no higher than 5 parts per million by the FDA has double that no more than one parts per million.  Okay, so somewhere in between there's what's to Regulatory Agencies. And so if you look at all the tuna examine and you look at the EPA level.  Over half the tuna samples exceeded that limit.  Pokemon Mercury when using that  a child at 55 lbs should eat no more than one serving. So two servings a month with the max in terms of their Mercury load from these to know so significant now when they looked at the different types, it turns out chunk light in water has the lowest levels of mercury are based on the study.  So that's an issue with fish. Can we get clean fish? You can then they have some great Mega threes available. But the random stuff you get in the store sushi restaurant. Is it clean and nobody's actually looked at it.  All right.  so  lipid digestion. So let's go into how our bodies digest lipids when we consume them.  Okay, so lipids are a great source of energy in days when we didn't get enough food. They were extremely precious days. Like now when most people are getting too much stress the world actually a problem and one of the reasons is that we've evolved under conditions in which food can get scares. So we become very efficient of extracting energy for my poop so lipids which is the best the most dense energy source 95% of it gets the sword by a healthy person just about all lipids. We ingest we absorb  Small intestine is the major site for digestion and absorption.  Now one of the general principles that we have to deal with that the body has to deal with when we think about digesting and absorbing lipids and long-chain fatty acids is that they're basically water inside and where enzymes work in an aqueous environment.  So, how does the body deal with that?  That's one of the major conceptual features that the digestion has to explain a grapple with plus explain three fatty acids saturated. They get added to the glycerol. Now, these poor head groups can make it partially charged but when it makes it Ester Bond, it's fairly a fairly hydrophobic molecule is triglycerides. So there's not much chance that water can get in there. And when you have lots of lipid molecules, you have it, you know a couple of oil it's not going to mix cuz the water gets extruded as these hydrophobic molecules aggregate together and they expelled water on Earth is ourselves going to take the gas is in the middle of these droplet Digestive and take him up and individual form. So that's the issue that we address.  Well the way it does it is it takes advantage of the culinary version of soap.  amphipathic molecules that have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains  and it uses these to solubilize those fats. Okay. So here's just one important example of a molecule at the body. This is our cells used. Here's the it's got its a diglyceride a phospholipid. It's got three car is got the glycerol has to 2 instead of 3, very polar head group phosphate group.  Now when these molecules get thrown into water, they form these my sales with these hydrophobic oily interiors and the hydrophilic outside molecules, the phosphate molecules sticking out into the water and these things can float around and not big oil globules. So this is one of the two critical amphipathic molecules that are digestive systems use lecithin a phospholipid. Here's the glycerol 2 fatty acids and here's a polar head group in addition to the phosphate. It also adds choline very highly charged nitrogen.  penarium nitrogen  All right again, you'll have to rely on doctoral Hampton to tell you what he wants you to know.  That's the other so that's very a pathic. So where is the hydrophobic part of this molecule?  You have to wake up. Do you start to drift getting late? So we got here?  Fat ass is okay. And I just feel like this here are more challenging than the other class of amphipathic molecules. The bile acids. Here's one kulick acid here is how you draw it out and just clean it for me and use the 3D chair model. You see one side is hydrophobic or hydrophilic.  So bile acids are also used for lipid digestion made in the liver stored in the gallbladder and pumped up.  Okay, so here is digestion conceptual.  Have a nice big fat Bob you whip cream or ice-cream. Hopefully you had lunch before you can.  Anna gets decomposed are emulsified by violin lesson.  A bind to the hydrophobic molecules and kind of suspend them in smaller clusters in aqueous solution than the lipase is then can come in and clip off fatty acids. So here's a representative to fatty acids and a monoglyceride for some reason and I do not know why a jestion doesn't strip it down the glycerol and Three fatty acid it ships it down to two fatty acids in a monoglyceride. This is what's taking up in ourselves. I do not know why but that's what happened. So this is the one of the fatty acids is left on the glycerol.  Okay, this is also showing that here by land should say left as soon as well solubilize ermosa feises the large fatty acid lipase from the pancreas comes in Clips it down to the monosaccharide mono glyceride and fatty acids are taken up by the epithelial cells of the small intestine.  Can you get the Mana glyceride and the fatty acid?  now  these two things have been brought back together to make a triglyceride and they're now ready to be transported to the rest of the body.  So comes in as a triglyceride gets broken down triglycerides are remade and then these and I'll be packaged up to send out to the rest of the body. That's basically he  the digestion process  is lipase is playing a very important role here.  Okay, so now we're going to get into.  As more interesting part is what are these packages that then send out these lipids to the rest of the body. This one shows one of them chylomicrons which involves phospholipids proteins cholesterol and triglycerides.  Did the doctor Hampton talk about cck?  Okay. Okay good. Hopefully, there's a couple of gastrin and cck that regulate digestion. The one that's involved in regulating lipid digestion is cck of cholecystokinin lipids in the small intestine result in the release of cck which then stimulates the release of bile from gallbladder and lipase is from the pancreas and buy them in the face is so make sure you remember that that was couple lectures ago cuz this is one of the key.  GI tract  regulatory hormones that affect lipid digestion  stop talking about this packaging here triglycerides. How do they get sent to the rest of the body now the same issue about digestion?  I'm talking about putting him into the lens and then I'll swing through the blood system in aqueous environment. How are you going to take these hydrophobic molecules and ship them around to the heart the brain to your muscles adipocytes.  Melissa's the baby that does it.  lipoprotein particles  pretty drawings of time doing that. Okay. So this has kind of a medium sized claw fuel Scott phospholipids on the outside to keep it soluble in aqueous environment and inside it has lots of these triglycerides and cholesterol which will get to text also includes proteins and cholesterol.  Okay.  Issa other diagram of a lipoprotein particle floating around in the blood systems  as I mentioned cholesterol, let me  Short formally sure you've been introduced to it. Very hydrophobic after that little hydroxyl group softness terrified. So that's not even an issue and its needs these lipoprotein particles to get around.  The cholesterol has a lot of bad rap, right? So you saw in that paper that doctor Hampton a sign that is associated with cardiovascular disease.  Which foods have the most cholesterol in them?  Jingle Bell order Propecia  animal fat good  Any particular Foods, what are wells people get their cholesterol from eggs?  So one of things I think we'll incorporate as I did when I thought the class has had all of you record everything you eat and drink for three days and then you analyze it and it was one of the things that come out of that was how much cholesterol is in a single egg yolk. So 200mg for egg yolk used to be that the max was 300 mg that the USDA recommend is the limit of cholesterol intake.  And so and that was has been Associated thought to be associated with vascular disease heart attacks and strokes. Okay. So let's all is kind of a white and black type of molecule. It's got some very beneficial properties. For example of essential component of cell membranes.  Needed for cell membranes work properly needed for estrogen hormones testosterone and for vitamin D.  Relative of a cholesterol the precursor to bile acids those emulsify and compounds in the digestive system based on cholesterol. Now, we make a lot of cholesterol are cells make it 20% in the liver and the rest of the body by 80% and it's only found in animal products. So most of the cholesterol is made in the body everyday. What about 1 gram? And we typically consume 200 to 300 per day. So it's not essential as your body makes it.  And this is an important point when considering about the effect of dietary cholesterol on our blood cholesterol levels. That's so critical one of the critical risk factors that Physicians use markers biomarkers for the state of your cardiovascular health, whether not you susceptible to heart disease is measuring your blood lipids. I'm sure all of you have had that done, right? Okay. So one of the things that's a critically important is what will raise those blood cholesterol levels and what will drop them particularly the bad ones, so  There is a biological mechanism and I can have an actually have to be an expert in this field and I've sent off an email the other day if you could explain it more cuz he spent most of his life studying the biosynthesis the first limiting step in the process of cholesterol biosynthesis. Is that  the body can adjust the amount of cholesterol it makes  and if we consume a lot of cholesterol our body can potentially compensate for that. So we take more in the body can compensate the question. I fired off into him. Do you know the mechanism behind that cuz I haven't encountered that we'll see if he can give us an answer to that so we can make less if we don't get enough we can make more as compensation mechanism.  so to understand  the clinical side of the medical side of these lipoprotein particle season of these terms have seen them before let me do some farriers are types of lipoprotein particles that are separated by their density in a centrifuge tube in central rogation equilibrium Central gation gradient. Those that have the highest density HDL LDL vldl in the lightest are chylomicrons.  The density is a function of how much lipid they have versus how much protein they have the more lipid the lighter it is.  The last lipid in the more protein the heavier it is so hdl's have at least amount of lipids. This is a purple in the ldls and XD ldls and the chylomicrons. So how am I Crohn's and the vldl have lots of triglycerides here describe is triacylglycerol. So those have the most triglycerides be else. That's the one that's considered the bad one.  it's kind of late, but  here's another intense life.  Olga spend little time and you'll notice I've waited out some of these things to make it in and rented them out of there once I want that are born to know.  Okay. So here are the liquid protein particles chylomicron, which is the lightest hdl's which of the heaviest ldls and vldl. So those are the four primary lipoprotein particle says other ones, but we're not going to talk much about  The function of the chylomicrons is pretty easy.  It's involved in transporting lipids and cholesterol from the intestine from our diet to the rest of the body. So when you think you think small intestine to the rest of the body and that includes the liver and then this Arrow indicates to all the other tissues of the body, that's what that signify that the body cells. Okay, cuz that's a job chylomicrons.  now the liver also makes  lots of cholesterol and his big storage place for a lipids. So it can also be a source of lipids and cholesterol and it uses the vldl the transport the lipids and the cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body.  So these are the two main transport vehicles for lipids in cholesterol from the small intestine and the liver.  Retreat for another way they deliver these lipids is that there are lipases that's it out on the epidermis and see the cell membrane of the cells typically of the of the blood system of capillaries and then entered the surrounding tissue. That's how the lipids get delivered. These big mouth is Big complexes are floating around in our blood. They reach a region that calls for some lipids lipases are out there that clip off the fatty acids. The fat ass is getting released in the cells absorb.  So that's how they deliver it and that's what she described here fat to body tissues via lipoprotein lipase has its releasing those fatty acids and it's being delivered to the cells. Now when you start stripping off the lipids the composition of the lipoprotein particle changes becomes  heavier or lighter  to take out the lips if they got fatty acids can be heavier or lighter, but now it's going to become heavier. The fatty acids are what makes it like so  And what it's called is called a Remnant she start clipping off the lipids. These are the fatty acids you end up with the remnants.  Now this is one type of Remnant. Another type of Remnant is called LVL if he keeps his cholesterol, he keeps tripping off the fatty acids you end up with vldl Remnant or an LVL leftover product way to deal with them transported back to the liver and the liver process. ISM makes men break them down and remakes the elvio's.  That's a healthy way. That's what the body normally does to recycle to transport out the lipids from the liver and then transports remnants back to them so they can reprocess.  The non-healthy pathway will focus on the LDL. Is this the LDL doesn't get transported back to the liver and gets recycled.  Then it can sit out in these arteries.  Get oxidized and start causing plaque.  So atherosclerosis is a deposition and oxidation of these Remnant vldl is called LDL that start accumulating in the walls of the arteries.  Start to form a plaque. This is especially true if these.  Protein is this complex has become oxidized and the oxidation is usually focused on the cholesterol.  Okay, so the healthy way is to go back and be processed by the liver. The unhealthy way is it gets deposited into the walls of the arteries it gets oxidized and it starts forming plaque.  So if you get cholesterol buildup in the artery walls, you're in trouble.  And data indicates that just about everybody.  Even early twenties AS stand America diet as flax in the arteries.  Okay, what's the process that's going on for almost all of us now the body fortunately has a way to try to scavenge this cholesterol that gets deposited in the artery wall doesn't get recycled back to the liver. So we have a champion Guardian Angel out there helping it's called it's made by the liver is transported into the the arteries and brings it back to the liver.  Can you take the cholesterol from the tissues are also can take it from the arteries itself?  Okay.  Okay, so that's the whole process an overview.  And so let's just  highlight each one of these lipoprotein particles so that you can  remember them highlights in chylomicrons  Those were the lightest the transport dietary lipids and cholesterol from the small intestine to liver in the tissues from dietary sources out to the rest of the body.  The way the lipids are delivered is that lipoprotein lipase has in the Wall of Blood cell cells clip off the fatty acids from the surrounding cells muscle cells take up those fat asses to burn them fat cells adipose cells take him up so they can store it.  Fatty acid depleted chylomicron is called The Remnant and then take him back to the liver and process so we can make new chylomicrons to restart the process. So, my crowns at the easy one the LDL vldl and HDL zarla bit more complicated. But these are the critical ones that determine whether not your sister your risk of heart disease is the transport lipids and cholesterol between the liver and the tissues vldl is made by the liver and lipids and it's the main supplier fatty acids to the tissues which again involved the lipases clipping off. The fatty acids release in the fatty acid has lipids are removed the density increases. They become LDL and vldl remnants.  Now the LDL which came from the vldl biggest component is cholesterol that is almost half of it a component is cholesterol and it's removed from the blood and if you're moving in a healthy way, it's removed by the liver. So here's another piece of information. The liver has specific receptors called LDL receptors that then buying those take him up and they break him down.  This process is supported by diets low in animal fats that is low in saturated fats. One of the reasons why you want to restrict the amount of saturated fat in your back this because it low saturated fatty acid diet is LDL receptors are working well, and they're Scavenging those ldls back to liver HDL is Scavenging cholesterol and returns it to the liver.  Let me just see here.  Okay. So so this is that picture again chylomicrons transferring from the small intestine the ldls from the liver and up a Remnant gets recycled back in the hdl's recycle of cholesterol.  So had enough.  No response before all right, so you're supposed to end at 3:20 and also hang out after class if you had questions and if it's more questions be on this at 3:30, then we can go outside and I have again.  Can you see sandiego.edu? "
