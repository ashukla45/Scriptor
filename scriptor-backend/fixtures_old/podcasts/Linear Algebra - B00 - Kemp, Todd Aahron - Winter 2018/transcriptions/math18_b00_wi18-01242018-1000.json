  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Let's get started.  So our usual reminders and let me begin with the last one on the page hear. Your first midterm is one week from today in the evening. It starts at 8 p.m. It's not in this room. There are three rooms in revelle college where the maternal take place one and Galbraith Hall into a New York. All those rooms are posted on the web page. You have a seat assignment already posted in Triton that for that exam go and look at it. Look at it several times make sure you know where your seat is because your seat might be in any one of those three rooms. Hey the rooms are not delineate it to one room for lecture. A104 lecture B104 lecture see the room sizes. Don't make that work in any way would rather treat you all as a single class. So your seats are there are there are all three of those rooms of Representatives seats in this room. So look up where your seat is what room and what state you're in before you get there. Okay, and that's posted on the web pages posted and said what?  Actual CDs. I'm going to remind you every day from now until the midterm that you need to know that going in starts at 8 p.m.  You can take until 10 p.m. If you want, but it is a 50-minute exam. It is designed so that we could do it in class. We don't want to do it in class because I want that time to review and I want you to not feel time for a 50 minute exam, but you'll have up to 2 hours to complete it last night. I posted to practice midterms on the course web page. You should go and check those out and try to work them. They are very similar to the midterm that you will see you will work next Wednesday. So I'm going to give you the same reminders about the midterm every day until then question.  Is the material on Mondays lecture going to be tested on the exam know the exam will cover everything we do up until Friday's lecture. It's possible to be a tiny bit of leak over into the beginning of Monday from chapter one, but I don't think so wear me to finish chapter 1 on when on Friday and that's what the exam covers everything we've done from chapter 1 and then a couple other quick reminders that your next MyMathLab homework on the stuff that we're doing this week is due on Monday by 11:59 p.m.  Let me also take this opportunity to mention that.  You've done your first to MyMathLab homework sets. They're already submitted now as part of your study process. You might well want to go back and review those exercises work them again work new versions of the problems of the computer will generate for you. It's a great idea, but be warned.  We're in the one week. After those assignments were do if you go into the system and try to wework those questions. Okay, if you rework a question and submit it, even if you get it, right the only going to get 50% credit because the late policy is if your work the questions a week after and the week after their do you can earn up to 50% credit so you don't want to rework cause problems in your actual homework set but there's a way around this you need to go into review mode. Okay. So look through the menus in MyMathLab and there's a way to access all the assignments in review mode and then it won't affect the grades at all as if that's what you should do. If you're going to use that as a study tool.  But don't do homework 3 interview mode because you actually want to be working it right now. And you also have your second Matlab homework set this Friday at to do this Friday at 11:59 p.m.  All right. So those are the best the administrator for today. So in today's lecture we're going to cover section 1.8 in the textbook, which is linear Transformations and next time on Friday will dissection 1.9 The Matrix of a linear transformation. So before I get going with that lecture, let me just tell you right off the bat. This sounds fancy write linear transformation. So I want to say two things about that first. It's just going to be more language to describe the same concept. We've already seen from A New Perspective just like we've seen before several times to be adding a new level of language that's really accessing the same ideas that we've been doing already in linear algebra. Okay, and secondly this word transformation their sounds fancy because it's a nineteenth-century word. C linear algebra is a very old subject. Okay, it's I mean, it's actually not as old as calculus, but it's it's definitely not  Century math most of what we're doing right now and in the 19th century people hadn't invented the word function yet. So you've all studied functions in junior high school high school. If you taking calculus, you've used the word function 75 times a day since you started here at UCSD. Okay, so you're probably pretty familiar with the idea of a function. I'm going to review briefly to make contact with what we need on the next side functions. Okay, but that word function to mean a rule assigning something the domain to Something in the codomain that word only came into common usage in the 1940s.  Before that other fancy sounding words like Transformations were used. The transformation is just an old-fashioned word.  four function  and I actually would prefer to call what we're doing in today's lecture linear functions if that's that's exactly the same thing your textbook uses and every textbook uses the old-fashioned language linear Transformations. So we'll stick with that but just keep in mind that it's just a different word for functions. So let's let's go ahead and proceed with with that. So here's a brief reminder of some ideas and terminology or dealing with functions that we're going to use today and going forward. So what is a function while a function is a rule?  By which you assign to each element in some set which we call the domain some element in some other set. Maybe it's the same set which we call the kodo me notation. We use for that is F4 function say we can use different letters. We will in this course probably use capital T A lot of the time for transformation F colon domain Arrow codomain the kind of functions that you studied largely in high school. And if in your first calculus course, if you've taken calculus is functions from the real line to the Reel line functions of a single real variable and spitting out a single real variable set where the function eats from is called the domain and then the set where it spits out into is called the codomain now you might have used the word range.  So the range of the function we're going to be careful about that because that word has has a slightly more precise meaning and we're going to actually use a different word or two words for range range an image, which we'll get to in a second in short. The range is the set of all things that get hit by the function, but that might not be all of the codomain to the code of man. Is this big set where the function Maps into example. This is the most relevant example for a one variable for us consider the function f of x equals 3x that's written up there. That's a function. It's actually a linear function.  Define precisely what that means in this lecture, but it's a function that just given by multiplication by real number. He take your input and you multiply by 3 gives you a new function that has lots of nice properties Cricut Explore another function g x squared minus 2x. That's a function from reel-to-reels. The domain is the real line and the codomain is the real output lives in the real one another one of that form ax equals sinx speed in any real number and you get a real number out.  So the domain in these cases is the real line in the codomain is the real line as well. But that's not the range of the function. The range of the function is the set of all.  Things that get hit by the function. So for example think about Sinex up there. So we all hopefully remember what the graph of sinx looks like.  Cancel if I draw a great approximately the graph of sinx.  Looks something like this.  Okay, I'm continuing on.  So that means that if I input some real number down here, that's the X the output. Is this number here sinx.  So the output is always a real number, but you can't get any real number as the sign of something the sine function if you remember it takes values between -1 and what?  So that means that the codomain of the sine function is the real line. That's the big set where they lift the values live. But really the range of the function the set of all possible values it can take the smaller and this case it's the interval from -1 up to 1.  So it for example also consider this function g x equals x squared minus 2x. So that function is domain is the real line. You can put in any real number there.  And its output where does it live its output lives in the rail line, but it's not clear of you. Probably already know the answer but this is review in case you don't the output of that function not every real number is in the range of that function. Okay. So let's look for example, let's try to plot that and so hopefully we remember that that function there its graph is a parabola.  Let's just build up a few points to see what the graph looks like. So G of zero if we plug in zero as ever in their G of 0 is 0  it's at the point 0 0 is on the graph. What if we put in x equals 1 G of 1 is 1 squared - 2 * 1 is 1 - 2 or -1  what if I put into?  Do you have to is 2 square which is 4 - 2 * 2 which is 4:00. So that gives me 0 again.  Let's do a -1 Shoji of -1 is -1 squared which is 1 - 2 * - 1 which is + 2 so I get one plus two or three.  as the value at -1  I'm so we hopefully remember what happens at this sweeps out this Parabola shape something like that the graph of that function g x from the graph and what's also you know, the sort of thing that you would prove would figure out how to prove in the first week of a calculus course or precalculus course is that that function it never takes values below minus one.  Right, so that that point at the bottom there G of one which is minus one. That's the lowest that ever gets. So the range of this function does not include any numbers less than -2 codomain is the hold a line, but the range is the set from -1 up to infinity and this case so the range  of the function G is the interval from -1 up to Infinity.  Not the whole core domain.  So that's the distinction between range and codomain and we're going to have to keep track of that as we go with linear functions as well. Now on the other hand if we look at this function f of x equals 3x  f x equals 3x. Well that one it's graph is just a straight line.  That's right line right there that was supposed to be perfectly straight. Let's try that again.  So there is the graph of f  And in that case the range is equal to the codomain. Every real number has the form 3x for some X, right cuz I can take X to be if I want to get the real number 76.  What apps do I have to use so that a fat. Real number X is equal to 76.  76/3 I wasn't asking you to do the arithmetic. It's not a whole number but you just / 3, right. So every real number is of the form 3x for some acts. And so the range is the whole real line for that function, but not true for the other two functions.  Okay, so that's one question. We want to think about was the distinction between Co domain and range and then another thing here we note so let's think about the function G again this parabolic function. This quadratic function does g of zero is zero, but are there any other points that take the value of 0 so now let's focus on some point that we know is in the range 0 is in the range of this function zero is the image under G of zero. That's another word that your textbook uses and we'll get used to the image of the function on some point. It just means we're it maps that point you can even put some point x it's images gfx.  Okay. So the image of 0 under G is 0 are there any other points Acts?  Put image under G is 0 does g of x equals 0 for any points X other than zero. Yeah, there's one drawn right there G of 2 is 0  okay, so there are some other points here.  But not to the same point. So if you'll remember language from your middle school or High School Poly High School when you started talking about these things to a function is something whose graph satisfies the vertical line test write to each X has exactly one value corresponding to it. So if I draw a vertical line up,  It only passes to the graph once but you can have a horizontal lines that pass through the graph at more than one point. So this is probably lost her. It's only satisfies that like most of the time a horizontal line passes through two points. There will be for every value in the range except for the bottom one or value in the range. They'll be two points that map to that value that have that value as their  So these are the kind of questions. We're going to want to think about giving any point in the domain. What is its image? What is the set of all points in the image? That's the range. Can we figure out what that is? And for any point that's in the range. How many points map to it is as just one point that match to it or might there be many  We're going to have some words to describe the different possibilities of those in a few minutes words that I hope you already know, especially if you've been reading the section already.  Alright, so now let's talk about the kind of functions were interested in in this class which are these linear transformations.  A linear transformation was just means function again transformation just means function.  Is a certain kind of function but it for many variables so their functions that map RN to RM for some and November for some M. Mike going to go from our November to our mic for some integers positive integers, November and Mike.  And before we talked about linear transformations in general, let's talk specifically about Matrix Transformations. Matrix. Transformations information is a function.  From RN to RM for some Eminem a function that is given by a particular form. It's given by matrix multiplication by some particular Matrix. So let's do it example, just and the examples going to show us how the whole thing works. So here's a matrix a it's a 2 by 3 Matrix.  It's going to yield a function that Matrix is going to give us a matrix function a matrix transformation.  And that Matrix transformation means blood going to be a function.  eat some vector  and spits out some other vector and the function is just defined by T of some Vector X is equal to a x x  Given by matrix multiplication now that tells us what the domain in the codomain have to be for this to make sense because we know that matrix multiplication of a matrix by a column Vector only makes sense for the appropriate sized common factor and the output is then the appropriate size given by The Matrix. So here what size does X have to have in order to multiply 8 * X  Someone from that side of the room.  I'm going to buy a x x a is a 2 by 3 Matrix. How many entries does X have to have for that matrix multiplication to be Define?  Yes.  3 right because remember a x x it just means use the coefficients in X to form a linear combination of The Columns of a that means you have to have three numbers corresponding to three columns. So X is going to be an R34 this to make sense.  to the have three components X1 X2 X3  know where is the output going to live? What's the codomain of this function?  Hey, what size Vector gets output when you multiply a x x someone from this side of the room?  Should we take a vote?  The problem is there's infinitely many numbers to choose from so we might get a lot of votes today.  That's I've heard three I've heard too. So let's vote between those two options is the output R3 raise your hand.  Is the output are to raise your hand it's a lot more people think are choosing are three and democracy worked because indeed you get are to as the output because the output is 8 * X which means we take the X linear combination of The Columns of a The Columns of a are height two vectors to take a linear combination of the man you get a height to Vector. So that just is so this is a x x  This is just Review Guys of of the matrix multiplication that we're going to be using lots and lots. So make sure that you're comfortable with it going forward.  so this means by definition x 1 * 1 - 3 + x 2 x - 5 7 + x 3 x - 7 5  and I could combine those together if I want I could rewrite this as  X1 - 5 x 2  -7 x 3 for the first component and -3 x 1 + 7 x 2 + 5 x 3 for the second component.  Okay, so there is there two different ways that we can write the action of this function a t is a function which takes a vector X1 X2 X3 in R3 and outputs of Vector in R to that Vector can be written as a x x for this Matrix AI or equivalently it can be written like this. I pay its first entry is that particular linear combination of X1 X2 and X3 and its second entry. Is that particular second linear combination of X1 X2 and X3.  This is the multivariate version to this is a multi-dimensional version.  of the function FX equals 3x from the last slide  indeed in one dimension of your domain in your codomain are both rr1 than the kind of matrices you could multiply there would be one by one matrices. But if your input and output are one-dimensional you have to have a 1 by 1 Matrix to make the scheme work and that's what tree is the number three is a 1 by 1 Matrix. Do you want to sit pretty silly way to think about numbers but that's what they are in our context. So this is the generalization using matrices of that kind of function that that kind of linear function not thinking back to this function f of x equals 3x we saw that in this case.  The range was all of the real line with equal to the codomain. So everything in the codomain was in fact in the range of this function because you can find for any real number why you can find in a real number X so that f x equals y Sol 3 x equals y  and similarly and that example there that function pass the horizontal line test.  Okay, because if I have two numbers, right if I would have 2 numbers in the range that 3x is equal to one of them + 3 Y is equal to the other one. But if they're the same number, then I could divide that number by three to get that x equals y and other was looking back at the graph of that function there. It's just that sloping line up there for any value in its range is only one value in the domain that gets you there.  Not like the parabola which swoops up again and can give you two different values in the range giving you the same value in the domain that function doesn't have that property that function for f x equals 3x is called 1212 that work a little later in the lecture.  So that's true, by the way from f x equals 3x. It's true for FX equals 76.  There is one example though of a linear function of one variable that doesn't have those properties.  There's one linear function in one variable. F x equals ax for some real number a that doesn't have all real numbers and its range and is not one to one which value of a has these degenerate properties 0 bytes o f at x equals 0 access just the function f x equals 0. It's just a horizontal line is its graph so the only real number and its range is 0 and it really failed the horizontal line test because it draft is a horizontal line. Every number takes the same value their linear functions on the real line have that dichotomy of behavior, either you have the zero-function which is really not one to one and really doesn't have all numbers and its range or in all other cases you get that they are one-to-one pasta horizontal line test and every real number is in the range.  That's not true anymore for Matrix Transformations for Matrix functions in higher dimensions in the sense that you can have intermediate Behavior as well. You can have nonzero functions that nevertheless Miss some elements of the codomain and that might not be one to one and we'll see you in the next couple of slides that these questions correspond exactly to the kinds of dichotomy questions. We've been figuring out how to answer in different contexts so far.  Okay, so that is a linear transformation. That is a matrix transformation. It is a function from RN to RM which is given by multiplication of the vector in r n by Sum by n Matrix.  So let's do some examples.  It will demonstrate how we can answer those kind of questions about images and domain and codomain vs range. So here is that same example that we saw on the last slide.  T is the function given by T of X is equal to X where a is that Matrix that 2 by 3 Matrix that we dealt with on the last slide. So just to belabor the point let's figure out again that's compute the value of this transformation the value of this function image of this function on a certain point. So here's a vector right here.  And there's a vector that I'm going to plug in Tootsie.  Sochi of that factor  01 1/2 - 1/2 again. I'm putting in some fractions there to remind you that we certainly can deal with non whole numbers in this class.  It can get Messier, but but we might need to sometimes.  Okay, so we are just multiplying like that.  So by definition that means we take zero X the first column.  Plus one half times the second column.  + - 1/2 * - 1/2 * the third column  and now we add those up. So the 0 means we don't even need to consider that and we get  minus 5/2  + 7/2 for the first component and we get 7/2 - 5/2 simplify that - 5/2 + 7/2 is 2/2, which is one and the second component is the negative about its -1.  So the image of tea on the vector 110 1/2 - 1/2 is the vector 1-1. I was just reminding you how to do matrix multiplication and what these words mean in this context.  Okay, great so we can certainly plug-in any Vector that we want and figure out the value go on at the plot points know when we're doing functions in earlier courses functions of one variable. Did I make a mistake?  I'm sorry. What?  Let's see. I got - 5/2 + 7/2 is positive one. The second component is 7/2 - 5/2 is also positive one. Thank you.  Good.  All right.  So we can certainly plug in any Vector we want and try to plot points now that the reason that we would do that for a function of one variable.  Without put one variable is we can plot the graph of such functions in the plane, right? We can put the the access the x-axis down here the y-axis up here and we can make the graph of the function to have a function from R12 R1 its graph lives in our to withdraw out that way but now I have a function. This one is a function from R3 to R2. Do I have to have an R3 down here and our two up here meaning that the graph would live in our five? So if I was going to plot points for the graph of this function, it lives in R53 hard to draw  Hey drawing, the graphs of these functions is not going to help we're never going to basically never going to be able to draw the graphs of these functions. We don't need to draw the graphs of these functions. All the questions that we want to answer will be able to answer using the tools of linear algebra that we've been developing. So for example, here's a question. So we've just seen that the vector 1 1  Is the image of tea on some particular Vector on the back to 0 1/2 - 1/2.  So question is that the only point there a 1/2 - 1/2 that has 1 1 as its image in a like we were asking about the parabola was Zero. The only point that matches your or the other points did not deserve that case. There was another point that not to 0 it was actually one of them there were two points in that case to let's see about this example for this function this linear transformation. How do we answer that question? We want to find out.  is there  some  point x other than the one in question 0 1/2 - 1/2  with t of x equal to the point 1-1. That's the question. We want to answer in other words. We want to solve T of x equals 1 1 and find the x is for which that's true. But T-Rex has just given by multiplication by a so we want to solve this Matrix equation ax equals B. We know how to do that. We do that by row reduction. So let's write the augmented Matrix.  Let's do the row operations. So I need to get a zero below that one when I multiply the first row by 3 and add to the second row giving me the desired 0 there I get 7 - 15 is -8  I guess.  -21 + 5 is -16 and I get 1 - 3 is -2 for that second row.  Now I would like to get a leading one in the second row. So I'm going to Pivot I'm going to divide through.  by -8 there  That gives me one.  2 and 1/4  Yes.  Etsy we were supposed to subtract hours supposed to add. So did I make more mistakes than that? Thank you very much, but I'm making lots of mistakes today. Sometimes you just have days like that, right?  Okay, so two reiterates we'll get there.  So in that second row we were supposed to supposed to add three times one to one and get for so that means that down here. We were correct before about getting a tattoo in the coefficient part of the Matrix, but that 4 / -8 is going to give us some - 1/2  Okay, and now I actually have to go through only one more step to get to reduced row Echelon form. I have to multiply the second row by 5 and add it to the first that will give us the desires of 0 above the leading one there.  So I multiply 2 by 5 and add it to 7 and I get three.  and I multiply -1/2 * 5 + night at when I get 1 - 5/2 which is 2/2 - 5/2 or - 3/2  I think  I know this Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form.  Which means we can pick off the solution and we see by the way that there is a free variable.  Thanks for the first and second columns are pivotal. The third one is not there's a free variable and there's no there's no inconsistency. There's no 0 equals 5 type inconsistent equation. That means we're going to have infinitely many solutions here. So actually we didn't even need to go to reduced row Echelon form to answer the question. Does t map any other Vector in R32? The Spectre the answer is yes, because the system is going to have infinitely many solutions. We know one of them is the vector 0 1/2 - 1/2 but it has infinitely many more and we can actually characterize them all so these equations here. They tell us that the solution set  Looks like well that first equations has x 1 + 3 x 3 is equal to -3 halves as usual will give a name will call it ask to this parameter X3. So that's going to be - 3s - 3/2 for x 1.  Give myself a little more space here.  The second component X2 is -2 s - 1/2 and the third component is well just ask.  which we know we can write in parametric form nicely as s x the vector - 3 - 2 1  plus the vector.  - 3/2 - 1/2 0  so all solutions look like that for some parameter s the one that we found up above. That was the one where Let's see. We have to choose an S to get zero in the first component. So we better choose a sequel to - 1/2. So I choose ass is equal to -1/2 then you do indeed get 0 1/2 - 1/2 when you do the calculation there.  I must have made a mistake, but I'm pretty sure that that that is correct.  Okay. So the answer to that first question does team have any other Vector 211 the answer is yes, and actually we can completely describe the set of all vectors that do it. It's not like the example on the first page of the parabola where there were two points that did it there actually infinitely many points. They get mapped infinitely many factors that get matched to the vector 1 1  but not every Vector gets knocked to one. We saw in the simple case of one variable. The only case where you had many points map me to the same case was the function f x equals 0 x f x equals zero then every Vector got match 2-0 every Point. Map to zero, but that's not true for this guy. Okay, it's not true that every Vector get smacked 220 indeed the vector x equals zero. We know always get smacked 208 times 0 is 0 so this is kind of intermediate case. The function has infinitely many vectors that map to some point one one, but lots of other actors that don't  Okay. So now what is the range of t?  It is more complicated question. I want to look at so we see that one one is in the range and it's in the range because many points map to it. I want to describe all points in the range every Vector B.  That is of the form tf-x. So this is the set of all B.  With t of x equals B for some be for some X in R3, so that's what I want to answer. What is that set? But this is just a matter of reinterpreting what this says in terms of language. We already know.  This is the set.  Abby  With ax equals be consistent.  We want to be able to solve ax equals B to find some X for which ax equals beat. That's all we're asking about for which bees ask people to be consistent. That's the range of this function t  and we have another description of that from a theorem from last week.  Ax equals B is consistent. There were four different conditions for that a icicles be well. There was a conditions for whether x equals be with consistent for every be but hidden inside there was the following fact that x equals be as consistent and it's just from the definition this means  that be  Is in the span?  of The Columns of a  Okay, that's what it means to say ax equals be as consistent because after all ax equals B.  That just says that's a that's a matrix equation. But if we're right it is a vector equation. It says x 1 x the First Column + X2 X the second column + x 3 * the third column equals B. It says b is a linear combination of The Columns of a so that's what we're looking for here this the range of this linear transformation is another name for the span of The Columns of The Matrix.  So what's the span of The Columns of the Matrix there now, we had this characterization from that theorem from last week. When do you know if a matrix has ax equals be solvable for every B?  If every row has a pivot great, that's something that you should remember and understand and let's look at the reduced row Echelon form of our Matrix.  This row indeed has a pivot as a pivot right there and this row.  Has a pivot just pivot is right there. Every row has a pivot here and there for the range of T. Therefore this span is equal to all of our two.  Take every Vector in R2 is in the span of those vectors. So the range is equal to R2.  Which is the coda mean?  up the function  so we can answer all of these questions are there. Is there one value or many values that map to a particular one take it particular vector?  And what is the set of all things that get map to what is the range these are just different language for questions. We've already been answering asking and answering. Can I solve ax equals be for a particular be what is the solution set look like for x equals B. Is it empty? Is it just one point or is it many points? And what is the set of all be for which eggs equals be as consistent? Those are questions. We've already been answering over and over in lecture and the homework and those same questions are the questions. We're going to ask an answer about linear transformation just with new language about the range and on about whether the function is one to one.  Crystal let's do another example here very quickly because I've already done the row reduction in order to answer it.  So here is a matrix a  and I'm going to consider the Matrix transformation The Matrix function T of x equals ax.  So the question I'm going to ask is is be in the range of that function t?  But all that means is can I solve ax equals B?  Can I find a text with a tax equals B has a solution so we know how to answer that question. We're just going to solve the try to solve the system and we're going to carry it to a row Echelon form to answer that question. So here is the original augmented Matrix for that system of writing it down a followed by B. And I've asked Matlab to convert that to reduced row Echelon form. And here's the reduced row Echelon form of that augmented Matrix now answer the question. Is that consistent?  No, absolutely not because there is a pivot in the last column.  Okay, so that third row there that's the equation 0 equals 1 which is inconsistent. And so the answer is no.  B is not in the range so then that behooves us to ask what is the rain again that's asking the same question from the last Slide the range of T is equal to the set of vectors be such that ax equals B is consistent.  and as we noted on the last slide, that's just the span of The Columns of a  And that's as good as you can get that's the best description you can get for the range of T. So now if you want to ask a question about the range is a certain Vector in the range you need to ask is that Vector in the span of these two vectors here, but that amounts to exactly the same thing. We just did you need to write down the augmented Matrix do row operations and answer the question by looking at the form of a row Echelon form of that Matrix.  Okay, so just new language range of linear transformation is the span of The Columns of that Matrix.  Are the Matrix transformation? So let's look at some special examples of Matrix transformations.  They have some geometric meaning to them. So here's one. For example, there's a matrix a 3 by 3 Matrix. That means that it's going to be a function from R3 to R3 The Matrix. Is that when they're 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 so, let's see. What is that? Do let's just write down the formula.  X2 X3  Okay, if I do the matrix multiplication, will that means I have to add up that Linnea X when your combination of the columns but with the ones and zeros there it's pretty easy to do that. Okay, so that first one 100 * just the X1. The second one is going to buy just the X2 and there's all zeros in the last row. So that just gives me a zero there. So this is the linear transformation which takes a vector in R 3.  Like this one.  And what it does to it is it just tells me it's X Y components down here. In other words if I shine a light straight down on it. It still tells me what the shadow is.  So it'd be fun to call this a shadow transformation which sounds like something from a video game, but we give it a slightly less sexy name to call it projection.  So this is the projection onto the X1 X2 plane.  Another one here. So there's a two-by-two matrix. That means it's going to represent a linear transformation from R2 to R2.  Okay. Well, that one is a little trickier to figure out let's let's just write down his components again X1 X2.  Hey, that means we X that Matrix and if you work it out, you'll see that what it does is give you - X2 X1.  So it's swaps the two components of the vector and multiply the first one by -1.  Now that maybe isn't so clear exactly what that means geometrically. So let's just do a couple of examples. Let's take the vector 1 0 so plugging in what that does is it gives us 01  and if I take  the vector zero one that gives me - 1 0  so that's a draw those on a grid.  So that first one.  the vector 1 0 is here and that gets map to  that Vector there. Okay, it does this.  Kind of action there. And if we start with that Vector there the vectors are a one that gets enough to that Vector. They're just that kind of action both of those cases for those two vectors what this linear transformation does. Is it rotates?  It rotates counterclockwise 90\u00b0 and actually that's what it does to every vector. And so this linear transformation is rotation.  90\u00b0 counterclockwise in the plant  No, I've only shown you that it's a rotation on those two special vectors those two particular vectors.  But in fact it's rotation on every vector and seeing is what it does to those two vectors as we'll see on the last item in a minute.  Actually tells us what it does to every Vector which is a remarkable thing about linear Transformations for the parabola that we started with if I pluck just one two, three points of it but start to build up an idea maybe what it looks like but you don't know what it really looks like four other points far away. You have to plot lots and lots of points to build up a picture of it. The remarkable thing about linear transformation is that you only need to know what they do on some special set of vectors in R2. You only ever need to know what they do to those two vectors and then you'll know what they do everywhere.  When are three there are three special vectors? Okay, so why is that? Well, let's let explained in the last 4 minutes here, by the way, cuz this clock is continuing to get a little faster and faster. It says we only have 3 minutes, but we actually have five minutes. So please don't look at that clock look at your at your watch and you'll see that we're now we have four minutes, but I want to give you your full 50 minutes of the lecture.  Okay, so  Let's talk about the key property of matrix multiplication that is going to make this cool property work matrix multiplication is linear.  We use that word a lot of this course, but it has a specific meaning here. It means this if I were to take two vectors u and v and add them up and then x a matrix a  that's the same thing as if I multiply those two vectors by The Matrix a separately and then add them up.  matrix multiplication distributes over the Edition  Just like real number multiplication test and similarly. It distributes over scalar multiplication.  Okay, if I multiply a x a scale Vector, that's the same thing as scaling the most of the day times that factor.  Matrix multiplication has those properties but it turns out that those properties are the Key properties of matrix multiplication that makes linear Transformations nice. So let's just abstract away from the matrices and say let's call a linear transformation. Let's go a function a linear transformation if it has those properties.  Meaning that to figure out what tea does on U + v i just add up to U of U and t a v and to figure out what tea does on c x v for some scalar. I just x t of e x c.  That's what a linear transformation is. It's a special kind of function between RN and RM for some Eminem with these properties. It distributes over addition and over scalar multiplication check. The sine function doesn't do that. The parabolic function x squared minus 2x doesn't do that Matrix Transformations do that day because of properties of matrix multiplication. So that's what a linear transformation is. It has those linear properties. It distributes over addition it it works nicely with addition and scalar multiplication.  So I want to show you consequences of that right now in the last 2 minutes that we have here. So one consequence is we always know what happens to zero under a linear transformation.  Tea of 0 is always equal to zero and that's because of that that second property there because T of zero I could write that as T of 0 * any Vector that I like, but I'm allowed to take out that zero.  And 0 times anything is 0 soti of 0 is 0.  Similarly by putting together the linear properties. Okay, the linear properties of distribution of are scalar multiplication and addition we get if I take a linear combination of some vectors C1 V1 + C2 V2 etcetera and I take T of that for a linear transformation tea that gives me the same thing as C One X TV 1 + C 2 x 2 V2 at set a Right Down the Line. I can push teeth Ruby Edition and the scalar multiplication. This has a fancy name.  It's called the principle of superposition, but I think only Engineers call it that it since it's sexy sounding name, but it really is a simple property that it behaves well with respect to addition and scalar multiplication. Yes, sexy means something different to mathematicians then to other people.  So let's in the last 30 seconds here. Let's just see what those that principle of superposition tells us about what an unknown linear transformation T does to an unknown Vector say Here's the the point I can write that unknown Vector X1 X2 X3. I can decompose it according to the X1.  the X2  and the X3  Okay. This is a kind of fun way to do it. Like when we're doing parametric Solutions, we pull out the parameters and leave some some constant vectors behind and now that principle of superposition that tells us that I can pull the X1 out in front of the T.  And the X2 out in front of the tea and the X3 out in front of the tea and add those up to get the same answer.  Now, what does that tell us that tells us something remarkable. It tells us that in order to tell you what the value of this linear transformation is on any Vector. I only need to know what it does to those three special vectors. If so, I have a function T. I haven't told you what it is. I haven't given you a formula for it. I haven't given you a matrix that represents that it's just a linear transformation. I only know what has he's on your properties knowing only that I can figure out what it does to every Vector. I can write down a formula for it as soon as I know just three things. I just need to know what it's images on those three vectors.  Okay, that is a remarkable property. That is why linear Transformations are useful. So we will continue with that and the relationship to Matrix transformation.  UC San Diego podcast ",
