I will make a decision on Friday about how many people from the waitlist to let in cuz I said I will be able to overload the class a little bit but as you can see we're already over full. So there are fire regulations about number of students who can be in here. There's also a Workforce of Tas who really should not be overworked. They don't get paid extra if they're more students in the class and it would be unfair to them. So it's just an unfortunate reality that we don't have the resources to teach every single student every term who wants to take this class. We're trying to amend that. Anyway, I'm going to let him as many people from the waitlist as I can. So hang in there for now and we'll we'll accommodate as many as we can but it won't be resolved until the end of next week.  Why we're going to continue today with Section 1.2 on row reduction and row Echelon form. And then we're going to proceed to Vector equations talk about and Vector equations. And that's the end of this week's topics next week. Monday is Martin Luther King's jr. Jr. Day. You have no class that day. We will proceed next Wednesday with Section 124. Matrix equations are usually reminders that your first and second MyMathLab assignments are due next Monday not becoming one but the following Monday, January 22nd by 11:59 p.m.  I'll be online system. And your first not love homework is due next Friday January 19th, and you should have received information by now from the Matlab ta you should have been signed up for the grapes Golf Course where you will submit your homework many of you have already asked technical questions about that procedure on Piazza, which is a great place to do that. And if you have more questions, please go ahead and poster.  And then one final reminder is that I have office hours and I'm going to start them today. So I'll be out of office hours today from 1 to 3 p.m. So you could follow me back from this room to my office at work. You couldn't be this afternoon class can follow me back from my office it from here to my office and I'll be there from 1 to 3 p.m. My office is in a P&M which is over there applied physics and Math building. I would have no applied physics and it's the Math building. My office is 5202 and I'm happy to talk to any of you that are there any questions over here before we starts?  Okay. So are there any questions anywhere else before we start?  So let's get started.  We're going to start by continuing and reviewing where we got to last day or talking about row Echelon form. Hey, this is the critical tool critical structure for matrices that we need to get to when we're doing real operations so that we can answer all of the usual questions that we want to answer about solving systems and whether you can solve and how far you can go and solving linear systems of equations.  Okay, so here is an example of a matrix that is in row Echelon form distracted by your full volume talking over there. So please try to keep it down. If I'm distracted. I guarantee you a lot of people around you are also distracted. This Matrix is in row Echelon form that some people have asked on Piazza because most of the examples that we've done we're Square matrices so far. How do you do in Russian form for a non Square? Matrix is a great question. And that's why I want to make this is non Square as possible for us to see so for a square Matrix is easy to talk about zeros below the diagonal as being something that's that you can recognize for a rectangular Matrix here is the the full explanation as we went through last day. So row Echelon form means  But you have these leading and trees. Those are the ones that are green squares there with yellow in the middle. Okay. So the leading entry in any row is the first non-zero entry reading from the left the first non Zero Entry in that row.  To say that a matrix is in row Echelon form in a row Echelon form is to say that okay, if I look at any given row and I look at its leading entry then if I look at the Robalo, but it's leading entry has to be further over to the right from it. If you get this upside down staircase type pattern could be 76 places to the right of it further to the right.  By the way, I said that last day which was a little imprecise was that there should be zero is below each leading country that is true of row Echelon form, but it doesn't uniquely specified. Okay, that's a consequence of rice wine farm, but the full definition of row Echelon form as you'll see in your textbook is that the leading entry of a row below where you currently are is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it for each row and then one more technical thing is that if you ever have a row of all zeros, all of those have to be at the bottom  The row reduction algorithm is designed to produce a matrix in this form is limiting. We start at the top left if there's a nonzero entry in that column and we use row operations to eliminate to turn to transform all of the entries below there in two zeros. And then we look at that next column. Look at the leading country that the highest up leaving entry and eliminate all of the nuns are entries below there and keep going and when we're done with the so-called forward phase of the algorithm we get something that looks like this and that is row Echelon form. And once our Matrix is in that form. We can answer the question.  Does the system represented by the segmented Matrix have a solution? Is it consistent or not? And if it is consistent is the solution unique or are there infinitely many solutions. Are we going to do several examples today to to point out again exactly how that works, but just to remind you of a little bit of critical language hear the important features that we look at for those are okay these  columns  These columns in this particular Matrix. That is the columns that have leading entries in them. Those are the ones that give us import information their locations are their number really these are called the pivotal columns.  If they're pivotal to the understanding of this system.  And the entries in those leading entries in those columns are sometimes called the pivots. That's a bit of a pun. I think that the term pivotal came first and then pivots or later and the operation the first row operation that we've done where you divide a row by a nonzero number in order to get a one there that's called pivoting.  Play that's the way that numerical linear algebra and its applications usually refer to it.  So those are the pivotal columns.  I'm in this example for for for instance. There are four pivotal columns. Matrix has five rows and 9 columns. Plus the augmented column.  What's the maximum number of pivotal columns that this Matrix could have had?  Yes.  Not quite that certainly is an upper Bound for it. It couldn't be more than a number of columns cuz you can't have more call up more public houses and call him cuz they're call him but there's another constraint.  Yes.  Exactly the number of rows. And in this case when there are more columns and rows, that's the critical constraint. So can you explain why the number of rows is a maximum for the number for the columns?  Okay, that that's that's actually a perfect explanation just have to substitute column for variable because they're interchangeable, but that's right. So you're let me paraphrase your answer, which is that.  each pivotal column  Has a leading entry in it and a leading entry has to be in one of the rows and each row has only one leading entry.  Thanks, so there can be no more than one pivotal column for each row. There. There might be fewer. The last row here has no leading entry. Right all its entries are 0-2 when that happens. You can have even fewer pivotal columns. Then there are rose, but in general the number of pivotal columns can't be any bigger than the number of rows or the number of columns is bounded above. It can't be bigger than the minimum of those two numbers in this case or you have more columns and rows meeting. If you have more variables than equations then it's the number of rows. That's the heart of her about you can't have more pivot columns. The number of rows are in this case. We have even fewer than that Maxima.  And that's going to tell us something about the solubility of the system as we'll discuss the moment. Anyway, so those pivotal columns are pivotal are crucial for understanding the solutions that but having the Matrix in a row Echelon form is not good enough to answer the question of what is the solution set unless it happens to be inconsistent if it's inconsistent, then the final answer is up. There are no Solutions.  But if there are solutions and you wanted characterize them you need to go further you need to do further row operations with the backward phase of the row reduction algorithm where you're using lower roast cancel. Nonzero entry higher Rose.  You take the Matrix to reduced row Echelon form at here is the schematic of reduced row Echelon form and that means two things have happened. The first thing you do is you pivot meaning that you divide through each of the nonzero Rose by the leading entry. So if that first data entry up there was a 7 you would divide through by 7 to get a leading one ones in the pivotal entries.  And then you use row operation starting at the bottom, right?  Using that pivotal one down there and using appropriate multiples of that road is subtract from higher Rose in order to get zeroes above it. And then you continue and do the same with the neck back have it all one and the next back and so forth. Okay because you produce those zeros above the further on one lives further operations won't affect that and you'll end up with a form that looks like where you're in row Echelon form and there are only zeros above and below every leading one that's reduced row Echelon form. And in that form. You can now answer the question. What is the solution set to that form will give you a complete description of what the solution set  Looks like okay.  So that's row Echelon form and reduced row Echelon form. The pivotal columns. Haven't moved.  You can recognize which columns are the pivotal column is. Once you get to row Echelon form and then taking it to reduced row Echelon form means that use raw operations to get it to this form where the pivotal columns they look just like ones and zeros with a single one in some leading position and zeros everywhere else.  And then the theorem the important theorem that we got to last day.  is that  every Matrix  can be carried.  2 reduced row Echelon form that's usually written rref form.  Biro operations  and this form  is unique  So what that means is okay, we're going to do row operations, but they may not be the same row operations. If you do it one way and you do it another way that you might choose different orders of operations, right? There are the three kinds of operations that were allowed to use we can pivot in divide through by non-zero number and any rope we can add a multiple of row 7 to rotate and replace relate with that new row, or we can swap to Rose. No following those rules. You're going to be able to get it to a forum like this.  But you might do those operations and totally different orders and that will result in different operations that you do along the way.  Okay, almost sure that you'll get use different algorithms along the way if you have a big enough Matrix, but the remarkable thing is it doesn't matter what order you do. Those operations doesn't matter exactly what real operations you do. There's only one reduced row Echelon form. You can never get too. It's not just that there's one schematic you can get to the same numbers will appear where the stars are there reduced row Echelon form of a matrix is well-defined. It is a uniquely defined thing that you always get to buy doing real operations and falling the algorithm no matter what order you do those operations.  So it tells us the sort of simplest form for the system could possibly be in the simplest form?  So that's our goal when we're giving a system. We want to write down that mountain Matrix and we want to use row operations to find a row Echelon form and there might be many of those they because you have just any nonzero entries in the pivot. Does he want?  That'll allow us to answer the question of is there a solution if so are there? Is there only one are there many but if you want to actually characterize the solution set you then continue their operation till you get to the reduced row Echelon form that tells you the full solution. Haven't fully explain explain how those things work. So we're going to do some examples to clarify.  Okay, so let's do this example here. So here is a system or this is an augmented Matrix. I'll put in my daughter line there. This is an augmented Matrix corresponding to a system of 3 equations in 4 unknowns.  Before we even start we know that the pivotal columns are going to be important in understanding the system. What is the maximum number of pivotal columns? We could possibly find in this example. We will there will be at a number before we even do anything we can figure out there are at most this many for this system. What is that number? How many could we possibly have? Yes.  Three cuz there are three rows and 4 columns and the minimum of those two numbers is three there can't be any more than three. There might be fewer than three because it could be that when we get to a row Echelon form the zeros at the bottom and then that wouldn't have a leading entry. Get well, let's see what happens in this case. So now let's do those row operations.  This one already has a zero and the 1/2 entry below the first one there. So we don't need to do anything with that row.  To know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the first row added to the third row and put the result in the third row.  Okay, that's going to give the desired 0 there.  the -7 will add to the seven and give a zero their 0 adds to -4 that doesn't do anything when six adds to 2 giving 8 down here by bad to seven giving a 12  and that didn't affect the first two rows.  Okay. I know we were starting to recognize we're getting close actually to a row Echelon form. So that first one 1 entry up there which is the one that's a leading entry. That's the leading one already. And then the second row it's leading entry is in the two three position. Okay, and that's a leading one already and we've got zeroes where we need them except in order for it to be in row Echelon form to just one more thing we need to do which is to get a zero below that leading one in the second row, right? The third row right now has a leading entry. That's also in the third column and that's not allowed because it has to be to the right. It's sitting in tree has to be to the right of the third column because the second row above it has it in between the third column. So we need to get rid of that - 4 using a row operation.  And so that's easy. We're going to add 4 * road to Touro Street and put the result in Row 3.  Okay, and so that's going to give us our desired zero hear the other zeros carryover and then finally look that -2 * 4 is -8. Which cancel the 8.  And -3 * 4 is -12 adding to that 12 gives us a zero, and we do have a row of zeros here.  Okay, this Matrix is in row Echelon form.  We have that upside down staircase tie pattern of zeros down there that we needed to get and so now we can answer all the questions. We need to about the status of the solution set. The first thing we need to do is identify which are the pivotal columns. Can someone tell me which columns are the pivotal column someone from this side of the room.  Yes.  Yes, that's correct column 1 and column three other pivotal, cuz those are the columns that have the pivotal entries that have the leading entries in them for those rows. The third row has no bleeding. So there's no third pivotal kala. This one actually only has two pivotal columns.  Okay. No I said that we have enough information to answer the question. What is the status of the solution said he run to see why that is in this case. Let me go ahead and go all the way to reduce Russian one form and will write down what the solution set looks like and then we can see the pattern of how just this tells us everything we need to know. Okay, but before I do that supposed wasn't a 7in that lower right entry and that means that suppose that in the third row, we had nonzero on the right hand side. There's suppose that the third row is 00005. What could we say right now?  Yes, that is an inconsistent system because that last equation would say 0 equals 5 to the contradiction.  Know if I had had a nonzero entry in that last column.  That would mean that that third row there. It's leading entry is in the last column.  Which would say that the last column is a pivotal color the right now Everton existence and uniqueness down here, which is the question of does there exist a solution? And is it unique? The one thing we can say right away is that  if  the final  in augmented column  is pivotal  the system  is inconsistent  So that's one thing we can recognize you right away. Look for the pivotal columns. And if the last color is pivotal if the other method calling is pivotal your hope no solution stop there and let me point out by the way that the locations of the pivotal columns don't change so we can say hey in the original Matrix those two column column 1 and column 3 were pivotal.  And those were the only pivotal call him we couldn't tell that by looking we had to do row operations to get to a row Echelon form to see which columns are pivotal. But now that we know those are the pivotal columns they are in every equivalent form of this Matrix Okay, so we've got part of the answer now, but in this case, we have no equation that says 0 equals 5, so we're okay we can keep going let's go. Let's keep going now doing row operations.  So now to finish putting this Matrix into reduced row Echelon form.  Oh, wait a second.  Is this Matrix in reduced row Echelon form? It is imagine that that I cooked it up to be like that. So it's already in reduced row Echelon form.  And so now we can actually completely write down what the solution set looks like.  So what I mean by that is let's translate this augmented Matrix back into equations now. Okay. So the equation say the first one says x 1 - 7 x 2  + 6 x 4 equals 5 and the second equation says X3.  -2 x 4  equals -3  that is the solution that doesn't look like a solution. It looks like more equations, but let me write in a slightly different form.  We're looking for the set of all points x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 that solve the system of equations, right? So.  I'm telling you that that said can be characterized exactly like this.  X3 and X5 X2 and X4 are not in pivotal columns. So we can't specify their values. They are totally unconstrained to remember what we call them. Well, let slip the late great Tom Petty answer that question.  Louder three variables are not wandering around the country leaving their girlfriend behind those variables are unconstrained. I guess those two are equivalent in Tom Petty in the late. Great. Tom Petty's mine, but for us, it just means we can substitute any values at all for X2 and X4 and whatever values we want to plug in for them. We will find a solution with those values for those two variables. Okay. So those ones we just leave untouched that's that's all we can do is whatever we want. That's worth whatever we want One Sweep in those down noticed that the equations over here this one in this one tell us what the values of X1 and X3 are the first equation there says x 1 is equal to 7 x 2  -6 x 4 + 5 + that equation says x 3 is equal to 2 x 4 - 3  and that is the solution.  set  hey right here.  So that tells us that.  Yes, this equation this system of equations has a solution and it has many solutions.  It has a two parameter family of solution X2 and X4 can be anything we want. Okay. Those are the three variables.  So X2 and X4 are free.  What that means is that those two columns.  Either here.  Or hear. Those are the free columns or they correspond to the free variables.  And so now we have a complete description. So we already saw if you have that the 3rd, the final column is pivotal. Then there are no Solutions if it is not, okay. Otherwise  the system  is consistent  Okay, but now the finals of the further questions. Okay, it's consistent. But is there one solution one unique solution or infinitely many solutions. And by the way this explanation that I'm going to give you no explains why you can't get only two solutions or 7 Solutions. Why does it economy between one solution or infinitely many solutions because if there are  free variables  there are infinitely many solutions.  Whereas if not if there are no free variables.  Which is the same thing as saying?  every column  in the coefficient Matrix  is pivotal  Then there is one solution.  Okay. So here we see the total solutions that is described as the set of points where well first we have to Prime Anders the two free variables and we can set them to be whatever we want. So since I can choose their values at random there infinitely many choices I can make in so there infinitely many solutions once I make choices for those values than the other parent the other variables be pivotal variables those are determined and we have a complete description of the solution set.  Know if there were no free variables.  But the system was consistent then that means there's just going to be one unique pain down solution. There is so meetings are no free variables. Nothing was free to choose then we would just get something like 5 0 - 3 0 as our only solution so now we have our complete that caught him here trichotomy here. We want to answer the question.  Is a system consisting or not and if it's consistent as a solution unique or not.  Now we see we actually didn't have to go all the way to reduce Rush 1/4 MOA. Although in this case. We got there by accident automatically once we have it in row Echelon form.  What's the weather in row Echelon form? We know where the pivotal columns are, which means we also know where the non pivotal columns are if there are any and that means we can count how many free variables there are. So the first thing we look at is. Is there a pivot in the last column? If so, no solution. If not count the number of three variables if there are any free variables than there are infinitely many solutions if there are no free variables. If every column in the coefficient Matrix was pivotal then there's one unique solution and that gives us our complete description.  Okay. Now this case as we saw that from the very beginning because there were more rows or columns and rows here. We couldn't possibly have as many pivot couldn't possibly have as many pivotal columns as there are columns.  I throw four columns, but we could have at most 3 pivotal columns and we saw they were actually only two but there were most three. So that means that there's guaranteed to be a free at least one free variable. Is it guaranteed to be at least one column which is not pivotal so we could say looking at that system just from the size of it just from the fact that there were more columns and rows that this thing can't have a unique solution. It might have no Solutions.  But if it has any solutions at all, it will have infinitely many just from looking at the size of the Matrix and then if you want to check if it has any solutions at all, you just have to verify that the last column isn't pivotal the way to check that is by carrying it to reduced it turn into a row Echelon form using row operations.  Okay.  So here's another example.  Which I've already done you the service of converting of carrying to a row Echelon form using row operations.  I will now finish doing the algorithm to carry it to reduce right one for him. But before we do that, you can answer for me immediately. The question of is the system consistent and if so, does it have one solution or infinitely many solutions. I'm going to give you 10 seconds and then we're going to take a three-way vote. Go ahead.  Please go ahead and talk to your neighbors.  Okay.  Let's get right to it. So now we're going to take a boat. So the three options are inconsistent. No Solutions consistent, but infinitely many solutions or consistent with one unique solution. How many people think it's inconsistent?  I see a few very tentative hands how many people think that is consistent with infinitely many solutions that looks like about infinitely many of you and how many people think that it is consistent and has one unique solution. There is one confident and in the back again, I like the confidence, but you're dead wrong.  But thanks for your courage. So democracy Works brilliantly in this case the answer rather you guys knowing your stuff works really only in this case. This is an example where there are infinitely many solutions on the way we can see that is just to say, okay. Let's look where the pivotal columns are. The pivotal columns are the columns.  That contain the leading entries. So the first row has a leading entry in the first entry. That's the first non-zero entry reading from the left. The second row. It's leading entry is in the second column. So the second column is pivotal the third row. It's leading entry is in the fifth column now, I didn't draw the dotted lines here, but let me draw them to make sure where am I so those are the pivotal entries. Those are the pivotal columns, 1/2 + 5  The final column is the sixth column is not pivotal.  To the system is consistent.  And so the three columns The Columns corresponding to free variables.  are the  fourth fifth third fourth and sixth columns and the pivotal columns are the 1st 2nd and 5th.  But the answer the question I wanted you to answer just now you actually needs to do you account first to recognize is the last column pivotal the answer is no perfect. That means the system is consistent.  Now are there any free variables?  There are actually two free variables I should say here again. We have to be careful. The last column has a different status than the other ones. So it's not that there are three free variables. The last column doesn't correspond to a variable. There are three columns that are non pivotal and two of them are in the coefficient Matrix. So those to correspond to the free variables the free variables are X3 and X4.  Okay. So now we know the answer the question this has infinitely many solutions and I'm sure there will be a two parameter family of solutions. Now, let's actually describe that solutions that which means we have to carry this Matrix to reduced row Echelon form.  Okay. Well actually it's pretty close already. We just need to do a few more steps. So the first thing I'm going to do it again you might do at least that's in a different order and the calculations would then be different than the ones I'm doing but we would arrive at the same answer. That's what crucial here. This is the reduced row Echelon form of the Matrix. We will both get to no matter what row operations we do.  Pause we don't make any mistakes.  Which we are very likely to actually do so be careful in when you're doing these things as much as possible. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to Pivot. I'm going to divide through the first row by three. Everything is extra divisible by 3. They're so that's going to give me a nice-looking answer.  Okay. Alright. Am I in reduced row Echelon form?  Know why not?  Write the pivotal ones of them to one's the pivotal ones don't have zeros above so we need to do row operations to get zeros above them. And in order to do that without interfering with with the later steps. We start now at the right lower part of The Matrix.  So I'm going to take Row 3 and subtract it from row to put the result in Row 2.  Okay, so that's going to give me the desired 0 above that one. It's not going to affect any of the earlier entries in that row.  Except I was going to do is affect the last column there. So we're subtracting for 4-3. We get - 7.  Okay.  And you know, I'm going to civil taneously do I'm going to subtract Row 3 from roll one for the result in Row 1 it. Well, actually I'm going to subtract twice Row 3 from Rogue one to get rid of the two. They're all of the zeros mean that the earlier entries aren't going to move.  And I'm going to get my designs are there on all that matters here is that I'm subtracting two times for from 5-3 there.  You know, I'm almost done. There's just one more pesky non Zero Entry above a leading one, which is the -3 above the second leading one. So to get rid of that. I'm going to add three times row to Touro one for the results and roll one.  That'll get me the desired 0 there. It won't affect all of these guys.  I'm not going to have enough space there. So let's do it down here.  Okay, so  This one remains unaffected that zero stays where it is as we wanted this for in this -3 are unaffected, but that one down there is going to introduce now. What are we doing? We're adding.  twice road to open up we're using road to so that's not going to change that but twice Row 2 is -14 in the last column - 3 is -17  And that Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form. Yes.  3rd column vs. Row. Yes, of course. It's very easy to get lost in in what you're doing here as you just saw me do.  Sorry, we were I was you looking at roast 3 instead of 4:02. So let's do this carefully one more time. We're adding three times road to  The robot that gives us the desired zero in the ministry position, but not have to multiply -2 * 3 + 3 - 6 + 2 forgives of -2 there.  And I have to multiply the 2 by 3 giving me 6 and at the -3 giving me a 3 there. No, I think.  is still  play I'm adding three times up. I'm adding three times row to Touro one. So let's by 3 * 7 gives you -21  so that's three times -7 is -21 - 3 is -24  Any more mistakes?  I'm going to pretend that I made all those mistakes on purpose. So you guys could catch them. Wasn't that a great pedagogical example? Yes. Good. Okay know it's super easy to make those mistakes which is why no shooting in their right mind would ever do this calculation. That's why I'm making you all do it 25 times on the homework because if you want to actually get this answer you're going to have a computer do it. You're going to ask Matt love to do it with your learning to do right now, but just because you have a calculator on your phone that can add a trillion times faster than you doesn't mean that you don't need to learn how to add you need to understand how this works before you can effectively use the computer to do it properly which means you have to Fumble around and do these annoying calculations 25 times until you got it down pat and then you'll understand how it works as we use it as a tool to answer more interesting questions.  Okay. So let's quickly now looking at the registration form. We can characterize the solution set. There are five variables here X1 X2 X3 X4 and X5.  We're going to write down what the solution set looks like first. We identify which are the three variables. Okay, that's these two as we saw out there X3 and X4. So those two are just in the solution set. Those are the parameters you can set those equal to whatever you want.  And then x 1 x 2 and x 5 are determined by them. So that first equation that says x 1 - 2 x 3 - 3 x 4 + 3 equals -24 so you move over the -2 x 3 + 3x for the other side and you get the next one is equal to 2 x 3 - 3 x 4 - 24 you get that x 2 is equal to 2 x 3 - 2 x 4 - 7 and that X5 is just equal to 4.  That's kind of nice. At least. We isolated x 5 x 5 isn't just determined by X-ray next fourth actually determined so it's fixed. The solution has X5 must always before but X1 and X2. Those are only determined after we choose the three variables x 3 exports values and there is the solution set up and we can see that there are infinitely many but we already knew that just looking at the at the row Echelon form.  Okay. So this is the sort of thing you need to be able to do at the drop of a hat. You need to be able to do row operations to find the Russian form and a reduced row Echelon form and then write down the solution set in a forum like this and we'll see how to use that in different ways as we go forward from here. But that is the key technical skill that you need to develop now just like most your homework is devoted to that scale in order to do the more interesting things that come later on this course.  And those more interesting things we're going to start right now off and have to do with vectors.  So now we're starting section 1.3 about vectors.  So what is a vector?  Anybody in here taking now or has taken first year physics?  Yeah, okay. So what's a vector?  You've been voluntold to answer.  Thank you. Thank you for giving the physics answer which is complete nonsense. But but you were tired anyway, so I was a physics major undergrad. I was taught a vector is a quantity that has Direction and magnitude. I still have no idea what that means. Okay, so that there's some truth to that you can make sense of it in certain ways but for us anyway and for mathematicians is a vector at least for now starting in his concrete setting is just a list of numbers a vector is just a finite list of numbers will usually right as a column. So maybe it's best if I the kind of actors were talking about we talk about column vectors. So for example, here are two vectors 1 - 2 and 2/5 these are matrices. By the way. This is a matrix. It is a 1 by 2 Matrix to buy one writer says two rows in one column.  So those are two vectors and those two vectors are in are to have two components each. Here's a vector 100 - 1/16 are for  has four components just a list of 4 numbers.  Here's another Vector. Today's closing stock prices for the stocks in the S&P 500.  So that's a column of numbers. And how long is it? How many stocks are there in the S&P? 500 anybody know? It's 505 don't ask me why but this is a vector in R 505 so you can look in the Wall Street Journal at 1 p.m. Today cuz the market close at 4 p.m. On Friday and look at that column will be spread out in many columns does the maintenance paper isn't my long hair? But that's a vector a list of 505 numbers.  Alright, so alright, that's kind of a silly name for something. We know we can just say it's a list but it's all about the interpretation. Okay.  Vectors are things that you can add.  And scalar multiply, that's really what a vector is. So for example of me take those first two vectors.  1 - 2  and two five I can add those two vectors together. I'll just add them component wise.  1 + 2 is 3 - 2 + 5 is 3 Mac gives me the vector 3 3.  Okay, so that's what a vector is a vector is a list of numbers thought of in a way that allows us to add them together and give meaning to that.  I can also multiply a vector way that first one by a scalar like an x 2 and that just means I'll scale-up both of the entries.  The vectors are list of numbers that can be added to to list of numbers two vectors of the same length to be added together to give a new Vector of that same length, and you can scale multiply them by scalars by real numbers.  No, you can also Imagine ways. We could Define multiplying two vectors together like we did with addition to smoke find the components that operation turns out not to be very nice in a lot of algebraic ways that we won't get into here. So we usually don't talk about it. We usually don't do it with think about adding vectors and scalars multiplying vectors, but not multiplying vectors together.  So that's what a vector is Frost list of numbers and we think about adding them and scalar multiplying them know there is a geometric meaning to adding them, which is really quite nice. Are those vectors from the last flight again 1 - 2 + 2 5  And I saw that when I add them together I get the vector 3 3 as a geometric way to make that happen, which is to say, okay. I'm going to add 2-5 2-1 to their 2 1-2 the way I do that.  is to take that second Vector say  and move it up to the  Tip of the last Specter. So I take that second vector 1-2 and I move its tail thought. It was a narrow here in the Cartesian plane. I move its tail up to the tip of the first factor and then I draw  The straight line that goes from the tail of the first Vector to the tip of this new one.  Okay, and that Vector is indeed the vector?  three three  So this is called let me tell you what it's called in a minute. But this is a geometric way to add two vectors together note you think about adding real numbers. It doesn't matter what order you add the number. So here I added to 5 + -1 -2 and there was a geometric procedure for doing that moving the second Vector up to the tail the first one that sounds like it might depend on which is first and which is second. So let's do it in the other now, let's take that.  first vector  and move it down too much.  And move it down to the tip of the vector below it ignore that other Red Line there.  And then if we draw the green line going up to the point where that new two vectors goes It goes to the same place. So it doesn't matter what order we do this operation. We get to the same neuvector another shape that we made in the process that shape that has four sides.  And they come in pairs where each are parallel to each other that shape is called a parallelogram. And so this geometric addition rule.  It's called the parallelogram law.  fried and vectors  So that's a geometric interpretation of of vector addition here and Vector multiplication. If I scalar multiply a vector that just means I make it longer in that same direction.  All right, so we can add vectors geometrically by the parallelogram law but really it's just a matter of adding the components. It's a simple simple thing that you can all do now when you first learned in elementary school how to add numbers together.  You learned a whole bunch of rules for the properties of this addition. Okay, and they're exactly the rules are written here. It doesn't matter what order you add.  And it doesn't matter if you have three of them whether you add the first two first and the third one later or the last two person the first one later.  Okay, so that's called the associative and commutative rules of addition. There's a number 0 what you can add to anything without changing it. So that's true for vectors to if you just take the zero Vector to the vector of all zeros to add that to a vector. You don't change it. Every Vector has a negative just by taking the negatives of all of the entries and when you add that to the original Vector you get the zero vector and so on down the line and rules of multiplication by scalars as well. Okay. So all of the usual properties, you would expect for addition and multiplication are real numbers. They also hold for addition and scalar multiplication of vectors.  Peso vectors are things that you can add and multiply and those operations look just like you would expect from what you learned for how to add and multiply real numbers.  Okay, let me finish with one final thing here, which is a tuck about linear combinations today.  So here are two vectors.  -1 one and two one  now we talked about adding two vectors before we talked about scalar multiplying vectors, but we might want to do those things in concert with each other. So for example, I could take  negative  of the first vector and added to twice the second vector.  Play so that's called a linear combination of those two vectors. That is I take two vectors or I could take 76 vectors actually and I multiply them by some scalars and I add the new thing up doing an operation like that is called a linear combination of those vectors where I combine them by using scalar multiplication and addition. So in this case here that will help visualize what that means. So here I've drawn the two vectors minus-11 is the red one and two one is the blue one.  And I'm trying to kind of grid that those vectors form if I just keep putting scalar multiples by integers for there. I'd build up this parallelogram grid and if I want to figure out where on this grid. Vector is to make it a little easier let's let's not do to their let's just do minus the first one plus the second one.  Okay, I just look here on this grid and say oh that means I'm going down here - 1 * the first one and I'm adding it to the to the blue one. And that's at this point over here. So that doctor there.  That doctor there is is the one that I've drawn there. So that's linear combinations of vectors. And the reason why it's important in the last thing we'll say here.  Is Spam that's a word that your textbooks? Can you use we're going to use it almost every day from now on.  the span  of a collection of vectors  is the set.  of all linear combinations  of those factors  So I look at all vectors that I can find.  By taking scalar multiples of the vectors in my given set and adding them up in different ways to this is called the span of those vectors or sometimes your text because at the span generated by those vectors, it's a complicated geometric object sex is not that complicated as we'll see but it sounds complicated but as we're going to see next day to understand the span. All we need to do is understand how to solve linear systems of equations. So that's what we're going to start with next week. There's No lecture on Monday. Enjoy your long weekend, and I'll see you next.  Can you see San Diego? ",
