  "Full Transcript": "Do I listen to a podcast? Hello and welcome to math 18 linear algebra. Put simply the most important course, you'll take this year. Possibly the most important course, you will take at UCSD. Those are not exaggerations and I hope you will agree by the end of this week, but that is true, but I'll be your instructor this quarter. I see they're quite a few of you at the back. I think there might be a few more seats peppered in but please try to come down for now sit in the aisles as comfortable as you can without locking too many people also be a problem with the temperature in here facilities has been notified. But if those are you at the back could please block the door fully open with the recycling bin so we can get a little bit of fresh air. That would be great. So we don't all pass out halfway through the class. Okay, so we're going to be over capacity for a while. There are a hundred people on the waitlist for this class. Unfortunately, I will not be able to let everyone in some of you who are on the waitlist will get in until that's all settled by the end of week 2 please try to arrive early. I guess if you want to see that's the best that I can say for now.  So this is linear algebra. I'm going to spend the first 20 minutes or so going through administrative matters for the class before we Dive Right In.  So first of all, there's a textbook required textbook for this class looks like this. This is linear algebra and its applications 5th edition. Mine says instructors Edition at the top doors won't but that's the only difference between them.  It is available at the bookstore. It's also available on Amazon for substantially less money. But let me point out something important here. You may want to get the more expensive coffee at the bookstore for the following reason. We're going to be using the online homework system that is linked to this textbook from the publisher Pearson MyMathLab. I'll go into details of that in a few minutes in order to access you need an access code the version of the textbook that is sold in the bookstore comes bundled with an access code. So if you buy the book stores copy, you will have an access code. If you don't you will have to purchase an access code separately. Now, you can do that and actually recommend that you do that because if you simply purchase the access code directly from the company through your pregnant page, which will be set up later this afternoon. The price is very low. It's 6999 and that comes with a copy of the e-textbook. So if you are okay not having a physical copy of the text.  But have just the e-textbook on your laptop or iPad or whatever. Then you get the whole thing for less than half the money of the hard copy of the textbook. If you really feel that you want a hard copy of the textbook then I recommend getting the one in the bookstore that comes bundled with the access code and I will tell you a little bit more about how the MyMathLab online homework system works when we get there. Okay, let's get that right now. So we'll be using this webpage. That's only thing I write on the board. I'll quarter hear this webpage as their main portal for the course and on here are links to everything you need. By the way. This is lecture b00. I'm also teaching lecture c00 and Eggers is teaching lecture a 0-0. All three of these lectures are coordinated. We will be working through the material exactly the same Pace doing the same homework. You will have common exams at the same times midterms and final exam. So you all three of these letters will be treated as a single lecture.  What that means is those of you who are way down on the waitlist in this class. You might want to consider just registering a professor Eggers 8 a.m. Class. Yeah. I know 8 a.m. Class, but you will get the same experience as teaching that is you will get in this room. You'll take the same exams and you'll actually get in the class may be the most important Point. Anyway, we will be accessing the course through this webpage online will be using Triton head but only for two purposes. So here's TriNet. Hopefully there will be when you access it. I won't be able to have to show you everything today. But on your Triton add page there will be a link on the right hand side that says my lab.  And you will click on there and we'll take you to the Pearson MyMathLab sight. The first time you do that it will prompt you to create an account. When you create an account, you will either enter the access code that you purchase from the bookstore or you will purchase an access code right then then you'll have access to the online homework system. Okay, if you are wait-listed in this class and you are not sure if you were going to get in there is a 14-day free Grace. So you can sign up for an account get a free access code for 14 days and you have to pay for it during that time. So there's no worry. You can wait until you know, you're in the class before you have to pay for it.  Alright, so let me talk a little bit about the homework on this class. As I said, that's actually one of only three kinds of homework in this class. So the MyMathLab is the online homework. They are questions from the exercises in the relevant sections of this textbook. Okay, but they are online. So you will be able to do them online at your leisure from your computer wherever you are submit them online and getting some feedback from them as well. You have infinite attempts meaning that you want to work a problem. You'll work it out. If you get it wrong on the computer will tell you know, that's not quite right and it suggests what you might want to do differently and you'll try again you get three attempts and if you still don't get it, right it will generate a new problem in the same style for you to die do and there's no limit to the number that you can do a this is a very useful pedagogical tool for you to learn the material.  Which is why I like using it. So that's the main homework for this class. There are also going to be theoretical homework assignments to go to go homework problems that are also chosen from the textbook from topics that are a little harder to implement automatic online grading for those problems are not going to be for you to turn in. So if you don't do them, nobody's going to know except you're going to know and I strongly recommend that you work them. There's a link to them here on this page, but without internet access, I can't show you and they're just list of homework problems from in here. I suggest that you work them discuss them with your ETA is in your discussion sections. Come to my office hours are Chase office hours and discuss them with us. Okay. Those are going to be important for you to understand the Core Concepts and some of your exam problems will be similar to those not Justa more computational ones that are online online system.  When does the third kind of homework in this class not lab assignments? Okay. So Matlab is a technical Computing and software package stands for Matrix luvoratory. It is one of the best pieces of software for doing computations with matrices and linear algebra, which this course is about there are five Matlab assignments that you will do throughout the quarter. The first one is actually do next Friday. So you should take a look at it right away that portion of the course is largely about teaching you how to use Matlab. But you also learn along with how to use Matlab you will learn Concepts in linear algebra and bolster what you're learning in this room also be a final quiz at the ends to test your core retention of of Matlab Concepts.  So those are the three kinds of homework in this class. The MyMathLab online homework sets will typically be due every Monday by 11:59 p.m. The exception is the first one will be do not this coming Monday a week from tonight, but the following one but homework to will also be due that day. I'm just giving an extra week for you guys to get settled into the online system and and so forth, but it would be a mistake to wait until next week to start homework one. You should start it as soon as you can so your Trident page should be linked by this afternoon or tomorrow at the earliest you'll be able to log in and create that account stopped working on that homework.  There will be three exams in a class 2 midterm exams in a final exam. They're already scheduled you should have seen them scheduled when you registered for the class. The midterm exams will see on the calendar when we go down on February 1st and March 1st or January 8th or January 31st and ends on February 28th at Wednesday is a week for Enrique evening exams. They will be held at 8 p.m. Not in this room actually in different rooms for the two different exams. You should just consult the web page poster tell you and I'll remind you beforehand.  They are listed as to our exams. They are not there one hour exams, but you can suspend after 2 hours working on them.  I know about you guys. I hate time to exams absolutely hate them and they don't test what we want test. Anyway, I don't want to test how good you are at working fast Under Pressure. I want to test that you understand what we've been doing in this room. So I'm going to design an exam which I expect will take less than 1 hour to finish that you could finish in a class session, but I'm going to give you up to two hours to finish it. Hopefully that will take off all the time pressure that you might feel to get it done. I wish I could give you six hours for the final. I don't have the authority to do that. And actually that'd be pretty gruelling. So the final exam will hopefully just be a little shorter than you might have otherwise expected but that's the deal with the exams. I should point out that the final exam and midterm exams schedules are irrevocable and non-negotiable. If you know now that you cannot make it to the final exam you should not be registered in this class. There's just no way around that okay with the midterm exams.  Grading scheme in a few minutes, there won't be no makeup exams, but there is a way to transfer grade from 1 midterm to the final if that's necessary and we'll talk about that in a moment. We're going to be using an online tool that can demonstrate for you without internet, but you will on your on your phones or your computer at home and online Forum called Piazza by Chopin's how many views Piazza before us a vast majority? That's great that it's an online Forum where you can post questions or comments that you can post it to me. So only I can see it or for the whole class to see you can choose to post anonymously so that your colleagues won't see who is hosting this question that you might feel embarrassed to post because you think it's a dumb question. There are no dumb questions within reason but most of the time if you have a question that you're confused about their probably 14 to 20 other people in this room.  Exact same thing just wipe you out too. So great because you'll get a chorus of people saying I was confused about that too. And you'll get a course of people saying yeah, I was confused too and then I figured out and here's the idea so it won't just be me answering your questions. It will be you answering each other's questions, which is so much better for your learning. It's better in terms of how fast you get a response eye on the t is will also be monitoring the site. Okay at answering your questions as well, but it's just a big collaboration being said, please do not post Exact Solutions on there that would defeat the whole purpose. Okay, but if you know how to do something and you understand a point that one of your colleagues makes that it was confusing to you too. And you figure it out. Please go ahead and try to give them hints. There will get a discussion to go and that's why it works. So well.  In particular just don't send me e-mail guys. Okay. Any question that you might have that you think anyone else in this room might also be interested in the answer to post it on Piazza. If you have some emergency that you need me to help you deal with, you know with rescheduling something because of a of a personal emergency. Okay. Send me an email but most of the time with anything to do with coarse material or logistics for the course posted on Piazza that's going to be our main communication tool this quarter, okay.  All right. So I just said we're going between all three of these lectures as one big unit. So the instructors are John tigers and myself here is the list of all the tears for the class for all three lectures. No UTA is for this lecture R Ashwin Nyack Rose Elliott Smith and fly brand has you'll see on the schedule down below and they're going to post their office hours when they've chosen them and you're going to see them here on this Google Calendar, which will be kept up-to-date. So here you'll see where all class where things are. You'll see on there. For example that I have office hours on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. And Fridays at 1 p.m. For 2 to our blocks real though, I won't start us off stairs until Friday this week. Hopefully, you won't have any questions tomorrow morning and if there any changes they'll be posted announcements on the course webpages well, but this is where you should look for office hours and later this week. Your Tia's will decide on and post their office hours here all your section times what you should already know.  Okay, and then I strongly recommend that you carefully read this whole webpage. Once all the course information is here the syllabus this calendar lists all of the topics for the course that we're going to run through from the textbook. We're not going to read through the textbook in linear order. Okay, we're going to be jumping around a little bit. So you should consult this page for what we're going to be there in the next and in particular. You should look at it a week in advance.  So you should see if you see today. We're going to be doing section 1.1 tomorrow. We're going to be doing section or tomorrow morning. When is there going to be a new section 1.23 on Friday?  By Wednesday's lecture you should have read through all of those sections and maybe the next one that we're going to cover as well. That doesn't mean you should read them and say yeah, I understood everything. I don't need to think about this again. Because if you're in that position, then you probably don't need to be in this room it but rather the most important thing you can do is read the section and figure out what it is that you don't yet understand reading that section. That's going to be your best tool for getting a lot out of this lecture come to lecture and say okay. These are the points that I need to understand and hopefully Camp can explain these things to me in the class. And if I don't then post on Piazza and will try to get it sorted out. It's super important that you do your best to read ahead in order to keep up with what we're doing.  Okay. So here's some more detail about the homework that I already discussed. It can read the details there.  Now let's talk about the grading scheme for this class.  What does two things I want to talk about in the grading scheme the actual letter grade scale and how your grade will be determined. Let's start with how your grade will be determined. There are three kinds of homework. There are midterms. I'm not love quiz in a final exam in here is how those are going to be used to determine your final grade in the class. So 5% of your grade will be determined by the Matlab homework assignments there five of them sore 1% for each of them and 5% from the Matlab quiz at the end and then there's also the MyMathLab online homework and that counts for 10% of your total grade. None of those things have any drop lowest score policy you have to do them all and there is a no late homework absolute policy. Okay, you cannot turn in late homework. It just won't be accepted the caveat for that is for the MyMathLab page the way it's set up is  Every problem that you successfully finish before the deadline you get up to full credit for but there's a week-long Grace. After the deadline during which you can continue to work on problems that you were unable to solve before the deadline, but during that week after the deadline you only get up to 50% credit and then if you're more than a week late, then you just can't continue to work on it for credit. Okay, and then there will be two midterm exams and the final exam and then there are two possible grading schemes either each midterm counts for 20% of your final grade and the final exam counts for 40% or your best midterm counts are 20% And the remaining 60% is on the on the final exam. Your grade will be determined by whichever. One of these two schemes gives you the highest score in the ant you don't have to play some sort of gambling game where you choose at the beginning. I will choose for you and I will choose whichever one of these games get you the higher score the purpose of this difference between these two  Is to give you an opportunity to miss a midterm. If you absolutely have to if there's an emergency if you're very ill and you just cannot write one of the midterms, then you will be graded according to the second scheme. Okay, and you won't necessarily suffer any consequences for missing that midterm. You should not use this as an excuse for not doing one of the midterms are for not studying for midterms if that would be a mistake, but that's what that policy is. Therefore. There won't be a minute makeup midterm exams. But if you have to miss one for some urgent reason then the score are the the weight of the grade from that Metro will be transferred onto the final exam.  I should mention that as a standard policy and all math courses at UCSD. You have to pass the final exam to pass the course no matter what as well in terms of what constitutes passing what constitutes different letter grades are is the guaranteed scale for the course. So when I say guaranteed what that means is that your letter grade will be determined by these cut off or better. So if you get 82 as your final combined score, you will be guaranteed to get at least a B minus. Maybe you'll get a b or even a B+ in this class. It depends on how the whole class does maybe I accidentally made a midterm. That was way too hard on the scores were all too low. I will compensate for that. I will curve for that if that happens. Okay, but you will not get below a B minus if you get an 82 and so that's what I mean by the scale is guaranteed particular if you get at least 70% combined overall, you will for sure pass this class.  Whether or not the country pass cutoff is lower than that will depend on on how things go and how you all do.  All right. So that's the grading scheme for the class. And then let me finish by mentioning a few more things administrative leave. First of all here is my standard bill on academic Integrity in this class. I've suggest that you read over carefully and also read the UCSD code of conduct code of academic integrity that's links there.  The usual issues revolve around academic dishonesty revolver on cheating. I'm sure that no one in this room is thinking of cheating which is great. I just want to point out from the start that the penalties for Cheating in this University are very harsh for good reason. If you are found responsible for cheating on a midterm exam, you will get an F in this class and you will at least be suspended and very likely expelled. Those are the typical administrative punishments for cheating on exams at this University, but none of you are thinking about cheating so we don't need to say anything more about that includes a lot more things than just not cheating. It includes giving credit where credit is due and so on your Matlab assignments, if you work together with a group list your group members there so we know that you work together. It's okay if you work together, but you need to list who you worked with.  Okay, and then I have a list of common courtesies are things here as well that I think are also part of academic Integrity. Like if you come in late despite your best efforts or if you have to leave early for an urgent appointment then please do so as quietly as possible. Please silence your cell phones before you enter. The room is another good example. Thank you to have her just demonstrated that that to me and no electronic devices of any kind that are unrelated to the course are allowed in here. So that is to say I can't control what your doing on your computer. If you are on your computer taking notes are following along great. Please don't be watching a movie. If you feel the need to do that then, you know just don't come to class that day. No one's going to force you to be in this room. And as you can see there's a lot of people waiting for seats. So if you're not here to give 100% of your attention to the lecture, then please give your seat to someone who will appreciate it.  Okay, there will be no electronic devices of any kind of loud on the exams including calculators. You will not be allowed a calculator. You will not need a calculator on the exams. The exams are not about testing how well you can do competitions there about testing how well you understand the algorithms that are we're going to learn this room to do this computation. No human should ever really be doing those computations computers can do them a trillion times more accurately and faster. Okay, but we need to understand how they work. So the exams will be designed so that you do not need a calculator. You will only need to do a little bit of whole number or maybe fractional arithmetic now and again, it's mostly about demonstrating you understand Concepts.  One thing I will say that I did mention earlier. Is it on exams? You will be allowed to bring a note sheet ISO on midterm exams. I will encourage you allow you and encourage you to bring a single eight and a half by 11 sheet of notes double-sided that you prepare yourself beforehand that there's the secret having that sheet of notes there with you is actually not going to help you at all.  Preparing that sheet of notes is a great way to start the studying process in particular. It doesn't make any sense for you to write everything that we've done in lecture into Point Funt on this page and bring a magnifying glass to try to find it during the exam that's not going to help the process of distilling what you've learned into material that can fit neatly on a single sheet of paper. That's going to be your best way to study the concepts to start studying at the only thing you should do so you can bring a sheet of notes for each of these names for the final exam. You can bring two sheets of notes. Okay, but no electronic devices are allowed. Let me mention that if you require accommodations because of a disability for this class, then you need to go if you haven't already to the office for students with disabilities and get your offer letter and bring that to me by the end of this week. I delete and then we'll accommodate according to what the  State requires of course, but please do that as quickly as possible so we can figure out what additional resources we need. And finally let me mention that at the bottom of the page here. There are number of resources for you as a page here at the links to the important vocabulary terms from the entire course. Okay. So if you understand every single term that you'll find on that page before the final exam then you're in good shape is some more general math and linear algebra resources there for you to take a look at and one that's mentioned in particular the first one under sites with resources and touring is supplemental instruction the SI program from the teaching and learning Commons, which is an in parallels or lecture section series that will be presented as the course for seeds that everybody is welcome to go to to give supplemental instruction and let me just ask the SI instructor for this course to say what one minute what that's about.  My name is a leader for this course. I will hold 3 seconds 15 minutes per week and check on this lecture. So whatever happens in the Monday lecture, I'll cover that in the like first SI session how to contact work.  I will be here. I'll probably write the schedule on the board. They should also be online.  Okay. Thank you very much.  So that's SI. There are a few other resources that are listed there that you could also take advantage of but anyway, there are lots of resources for you in this class. You should take advantage of as many of them as you think are necessary for you.  One more thing I mentioned before we finally get into course material. I think we actually have internet now so I could show you some of those links but I probably won't at this point is that I will be lecturing from the iPad and what that means is that you will be able to find the lectures for this course online afterward. Okay. So let me actually real of this page now that I think I have internet and you'll see here at the bottom of the web page is going to be listed for my to lectures. That should be in lecture. See everyday at least a day before the lecture. I will post these slots the same as for the other one is math 18 lecture b00 and here is a copy of a PDF file of the slides the skeleton sides for today's lecture that will get you in just a moment and you can look at that beforehand. You can download it. You can print it if you want to take notes as we go and I'm going to give the lecture on the iPad and after the lecture I will also pay  The actor notes for we filled in so you can find them online. So you may not have to take notes in this room. Now if taking notes is something that actually help process, please go ahead and do it. But all of it is going to be there for you before and after you can also go to podcast at ucsd.edu and see and hear the spring cast and podcast for this class every lecture after it happens. Okay. So if you have to miss a class or if you want to go through it again, you can go there and see it again and you can go through it at a faster speed as well so that you don't have to spend a whole 50 minutes reviewing but it could be an effective if you review tool for you.  Your first discussion sections will happen this coming Thursday that you already see listed at EA's office hours will be posted before then everything. I wanted to say administratively. Are there any quick questions before we start into the course material?  Okay, great. So, let's go ahead and start the course. So this is linear algebra. And as I said the very beginning this is the most important course that you will take this year and possibly during your whole career know why is that for number of reasons? First of all, if you are in a major that has anything to do with science or engineering the tools ideas and techniques that you will learn in this room will be fundamental to every single course that you take in your major from here on out.  Okay, so that's one practical reason why this course is very important, but there's also a bigger reason.  Which is why it's important to all of those courses, which sit this is the linear algebra underlies everything that we do in science in engineering.  Okay, linear algebra fundamentally is just about solving linear equations. And that's what we're going to learn to do in this course.  Okay, and what that means we will interpret okay, but all physical systems that we work with in the world. Well, they're usually not linear systems are almost never linear systems, but one of the basic tenets of mathematics and science is that all systems are that we can study are approximately linear calculus is okay. And so we work with linear approximation to those systems that we can actually solve and then use that to approximate what actually happens and then do finer and finer orders of approximation until we can understand what's going on across the Spectrum. That's what science does and so if you understand everything that happens in this room, it's going to be tantamount to understanding everything that you do from then on.  What other two other things I'll mention about why linear algebra is important anybody in here have a phone or a computer?  Big probably a few of you.  Your phone or computer has many processors in it. Okay, you're here might have four or eight of them plus the video processor. Your phone has at least one and one of each kind of processor is doing all day. All it's doing is solving linear equations. That's literally all computers can do you can use those operations and build from there to build logic circuits and logic gates in order to construct the architecture of modern computers are so that's another example where you start with linear systems and use them to approximate and build from there doing all sorts of everything. So hopefully that convinces you that it's important understand what linear algebra is all about an important class for you is stuff is just really fun. At least I think so and I hope to convince you of that by the end of this quarter or maybe by the end of this lecture.  Stop be pretty ambitious though. What we're doing today, which is section 1.1 of the textbook systems of linear equations. And what we will get the next time section 1.2 again. This is a reminder that you should be reading ahead before the next lecture what we're going to be doing in that lecture and at the bottom of the give you reminders about what are some upcoming due date. So your first MyMathLab Pearson online homework set is do not next Monday, but the Monday after but you should think about it as if it were due this coming Monday and hopefully get set up on the system and working on it as soon as possible second homework is due the same day and your first not love homework. That is due next Friday.  Alright, so let us know this kind of system of two equations in two unknowns. You saw it in high school probably know how to deal with it several ways. But working out start slowly here. What is linear algebra all about it's about solving systems of equations like this. So that it is you have two unknowns the next one next to  and I will give you in this case two equations that X1 and X2 satisfy and you want to solve them before we even discuss it. We need to look at some examples for some subtleties and different kinds of behavior that might happen.  In the case of two unknowns what's free as we'll see at the end of the lecture. It is possible to think about this completely geometrically. What does that first equation up there me that first equation. This one here says  I've two variables X1 X2 and they satisfy the equation x 1 - 2 x 2 equals -1  Now we should remember from high school that that is the equation of a line in the Cartesian plane. Okay. So what line is it? Well, let's see here. If I bought two points on the line and I can draw the line. So if I said x 1 equal to 0 then that says - 2 x 2 equals -1 so x 2 equals 1/2. So the points 0 and 1/2 is on that line. And then if I let x 2 equals zero, then that says x 1 equals -1 so that point there is on the line. And so if I just drove at the straight lines throughout that wasn't very good was it but One More Time by draw the straight line that passes through those two points. There we go. So the first equation describes that law  Now the second equation by do the same thing. If I bought two points on that line, let's do it in a different color by set X1 equal to zero than that says x 2 equals one. Okay, so that's that point there.  And if I said X2 equal to zero that says x 1 equals -3 should that point there? And so if I draw the straight line connecting those two points, I got that.  So these two equations describe those two lines and if I'm asking to solve the two equations what that saying is find a point or some points X1 x2 in the plane that are on both of those lights. That is I'm looking for the intersection of those two lines if they happen to intersect and we can see that they do and clearly they intersect in a single point right there. Now, how do I actually find the coordinates of that point? Will there's a number of ways to do it the way you probably saw her first or maybe the only way you've seen in high school class was to do back substitution so I can take me let's call this equation 1 equation to and I can take equation one and I can solve it for one variable in terms of the other. So that's actually solving for x 1 in terms of x 2.  What does x 1 is equal to 2 x 2 - 1?  Okay. Now this is a new equation. Maybe I'll give it a name. I'll call it equation 3.  And there's no new information by doing that. Okay. So if I if I only had equations 1 and 3 they say the same thing, but now I could take equation two and three together and maybe to do something from that and I can indeed if I put these two together.  Then I have two equations for x one. So I'll substitute in the value for x one that I got an equation Stree into equation 2 and get that - 2 x 2 - 1  + 3 x 2  equals 3 and now I can solve that for X2. It's just a single linear equation for a single variable x 2 so that says -2 x 2 + 1 + 3 x 2 equals 3  So if I simplify 2 - 2 x 2 + 3 x 2 that just gives me a single copy of X2 + x 2 + 1 equals 3 subtract the one from both sides and I get x 2 equals to what tells me that whatever these two intersect the X to coordinate has to be to they know that's not what it looked like in the picture that says because my lines aren't exactly right on and then I can now back substitute that into one of the two equations. For example, this one here that tells me that there for x 1 is equal to 2 * x 2 which is to  -1.4 - 1 or 3-4 the value of X1 at the intersection point is 3 so these two equations have a unique solution.  Which is the point x 1 x 2 is equal to x 1 is 3 and x 2 is 2.  Okay. Now that's not the only or best way to sell them will get into in just a second, but the four-week discuss alternate methods. Let's look at a related system of equations down here. Okay. So here is a different system of equations. Actually. The first equation is the same. This is the same equation we had before call equation one, but the second equation there is not the same as equation to one of the numbers is changed the three in front of x to the coefficient of products to is now to the different equation with Colette equation Prime.  Different system of equations. So actually let's think about it for a second geometrically. This is a system of two equations in two unknowns each one represents the equation for a long one of those lines. We've already drawn up above. Okay, so it's this line here.  That's the the first line there. And so that's that's the line given by the equation 1.  An equation to okay. What is the what is that equation say, well, we could plot some points on it again. Let's just plot again. We're x 1 equals 0 now that gives me x 2 is equal to 3/2.  Okay, so that's here. And when x 2 equals 0 that tells me the next one is equal to -3 she's down here and I should use different color. But if I now draw the straight lines running those ones I see something interesting Again part of my drawing there. But if you actually drive carefully you'll see that those two equations those two lines are parallel to each other. Each of them has a slope of 1/2.  And they're parallel which means they never intersect. So if I try to solve the system of equations, I will not find a solution.  And so for example, let's try to do the back substitution method like before so here I can solve and say all right vs equation. As before says that X1.  Is equal to 2 x 2 - oops?  Is equal to 2x to -1. And now if I substitute that into equation to Prime that says that the negative of 2 x 2 - 1 + 2 x 2 equals 3  If I simplify that says -2 x 2 + 1 + 2 x 2 equals 3 another 2 x 2 and the -2 x to cancel and these two equations give me the equation 1 equals 3.  Oh, that is not true.  And that's the sort of thing that will see happen. If you have two equations for two parallel lines and you try to solve them you'll arrive at a contradiction which is to sell you to tell you that there are no Solutions.  Okay, so here are two fundamentally different kinds of behaviors we can have for the solution set of a system of equations. There could be a unique solution or there could be no solution. There's still a third possibility as well. What if hear this had been one? What is the equation instead - x 1 + 2 x 2 equals -1  Well, then if you think about it a little bit that equation is actually the same as equation one. It's just everything is multiply 3 by -1 it carries. No new information that equation is an equation for the same line. Okay this line right here. So if those have been the two equations, there are two independent equations there really two copies of the same equation and now there are infinitely many solutions. Every point on that line is a solution for those two equation there two equations, but they only carry as much information as one equation part of what we're going to do in this class has developed some precise vocabulary for these ideas of several five equations carrying only as much information as there are in three independent equation starting next day develop some vocabulary describe what that really means, but now we see three at least three totally different kinds of behavior that we can get from the solution sets of some systems of equations.  So we'll talk a little bit more about that. But before we do, I want to talk about a different way. I mean calculation that works at almost exactly the same in these examples but a different scheme a different algorithm for solving these equations in the first place back substitution is actually a perfectly fine method for solving small systems of equations for larger systems. It gets a lot more cumbersome as a different technique invented by ghosts that scales up a lot better and it's sometimes called gaussian elimination, but a better description of it is row reduction.  We're going to say that phrase row reduction 450 x this quarter at least and so get used to it now cuz you're going to have to be the answer to almost every question is quarter one form or another. So the idea here is if I want to solve a system of equations. There's that first system that we had before instead of solving one for one variable in terms of the others. What we can do is multiply the equations by different constants and add and subtract them from each other physically ideas slide.  You can change the equations play as long as you preserve the equals sign. So the equations might change you can multiply 3 by -1. It's a different equation now, but it carries the same information that it did before. So any operations that we care to do that preserve the equal signs will not change the solution set but might make it easier to figure out what the solution set is.  So here for example the first system. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take these two equations and add them together to get a new equation it what I mean by that is add the stuff on the left the stuff on the right and put an equal sign between them and that preserves the equality. So it's perfectly legal to do and the reason why that's a nice thing to do here. Is that look I've got an X1 - X1 those two are going to cancel to buy add this together. I get a zero.  And then - 2 x 2 + 3 x 2 is + x 2 equals -1 + 3 is 2 but with approximately one-sixth the writing is this was definitely a more efficient way to get the solution for 4 x 2 now I need to figure out what x what X1 is as well at this point. I could do the back substitution method again, that's just as efficient or I could try a different thing and say okay now I need to isolate X2 from these two equations.  So what I'm going to do is let's see. Well, I've got my new equations. Let me replace.  This second equation with the new one that I produced there. So the before I head the equations 1 and 2, I produced a new equation 3 and now I'm going to replace the system I had before with this new system where equation one stays the same an equation to is just x 2 equals to  there's no harm in doing that. It carries the same information that the previous system did. I know I want to eliminate x 2 of solve for x to their I want to eliminate x22 from this business.  Not if I just add these equations together, that's not going to work because I've got 2 x 2 is in the first equation minus fixtures and one in the second one. So what should I do?  any thoughts  multiply the bottom equation by 2. So I'm going to do another transformation of this. I'm going to replace the system.  Buy one where I multiply the second equation by 2.  Carries the same information as before. I know I'll add those two together.  and I get X1 plus 0 equals 4 minus 1, which is 3 and look I've solved my system isolated next to  and I wrote more than I needed to hear in order to get to that point, but it was still less writing than before.  Know if I did the same thing with the second system we tried last time.  Okay, I want to try to solve this system which we saw a represents two parallel lines that don't intersect. If I add these two up I get a zero plus zero equals to arrive at a contradiction, which means up there were no Solutions.  Okay these.  Row operations that we're doing here. This is the way we are going to solve equations and it's scales up really well to larger systems of equations and we'll spend the last 5 minutes attempting one of those to see what I mean. But before we get there to let me mention a little bit of vocabulary now to talk about the things that we've seen in these examples, so we saw that there are three things typically that can happen. Okay. Might be no solution at all or there might be exactly one solution or there might be many solutions or two cases if there are some solutions  Okay, we call the system consistent.  That's a consistent system of equations. Meaning they are solvable you might also say solvable, but the term we use has consistent or as if there's no solution will call them inconsistent.  What I should say also in this process here on the last page where we took a system of equations. We did some arithmetic operations to produce a new equation from them and then solve the new system consisting of new equations, but that we got from the old ones by legal operations.  Okay, if we do that then the news the new system of equations is called equivalent to the old one.  So equivalent means we got them from the old one by doing legal operations by preserving the equal sides and that's going to preserve the solution set which is what we're interested in finding.  Okay, so we have three different situations we could be in either. There's no solution inconsistent or it's a consistent system in which case there might be only one solution or infinitely. That's what we saw in the example that we've looked at so far, but it turns out that's totally Universal. Those are the three possibilities that you can have. No Solutions one solution or infinitely many you can't have two solutions are not just the way that linear algebra Works in nonlinear algebraic polynomial equations. You could have two solutions or 76 depending on the degree of the polynomial but in linear algebra, it's always one or infinitely many solutions.  Okay, so to finish off.  Let's now look at a larger system of equations three equations in three unknowns. No again, we could interpret this geometrically.  Hey, we could interpret it as the cyst as a system of three equations in three unknowns represents three planes that first equation is the equation of some plane in three-dimensional space. So the second and so is the third and we're looking at whether those three planes intersect if there's a if there's some point that is on all three planes, maybe there are many points are all maybe there are not maybe that's exactly want. Those are three kinds of examples are easy to see in this room. Look at the corner of the room down here.  Okay, so the floor is a plane. This wall is a plane and that wall is a plane.  And that corner is the unique solution of that system of three equations notes. Hey, it's the unique point on all three of those plants are three more plants the floor this wall and the ceiling  those are three planes and that system of equations is inconsistent. There's no point that is on all three of those points.  Is another system of equations?  The wall here.  This wall here.  And the plane that comes up perpendicularly here that you can't see.  Those are three planes and they have infinitely many solutions to that system. This whole line here is on all three of those plans of that fan-like shape.  So again, we could have all three of those possibilities we could have no solution one solution or infinitely many solutions. How do we find those Solutions? I'm not going to have time to do it right now, but we can follow the same procedure as before which is to add and subtract multiples of these equations to each other until we can easily solve them. So let's just do one step in the last one and a half minutes that we have here. So the first equation there has an X1 and the last equation has a 5 x 1. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply that first equation.  by -5  you have to multiply everything by -5 in equation.  I know if I put that together with the last equation.  And add them up.  Those cancel and I get a new equation which says 10 x 2 - 3 they're - 10 x 3 equals.  Seconds me a new equation. I haven't gotten any closer at least on first inspection to solve an equation if I replace this equation with this one.  Then I still have three equations none of which is solved. But now I have two equations that have only X2 and X3 in them.  I know I could do what I did on the last slide and solve those two for X2 and X3 and back substitute to self RX1 so we could go ahead and do that if we had more time, but before we finish in the last 30 seconds, let me point out that I just did a whole lot of writing and there's no real good reason for me to do all of that writing if I keep track of the arithmetic operations. So the last slide here, let me show you the same information that was containing this system is contained in this Matrix. A matrix is just an array of numbers and here I have the coefficients from the system of equations on the left and the solution on the right that what they were equal to on the right guys. I'm not finished yet.  Please do not pick up your bags yet. I'm not done and a lot of you are going to want to hear this. So please be courteous to your neighbors. We might go 30 seconds over but won't go more than 30 seconds over.  Just to show you exactly what we just did. What we did was we took this Row one here. That's was Row 3 in this Matrix in the exact operation that we just did on the last slide.  was  we took  -5 * Row 1  We added it to roast 3 and put the result in grocery. I don't need to have the X1 X2 and X3 around in order to do that operation.  Right. I just say out I take Row 1 multiply it through by -5 and add it to Row 3 that gives me -5 + 5, which is 0  1010 + 0 which is 10.  + - 5 - 5 which is -10  + 0 + 10 which is 10 carryover the same numbers that I had before what we just did is a typical example of a row operation and it carries the same information that was in the second system of equations there with a whole lot less writing. There's no reason to carry that X1 X2 X3 equal sign around when you're doing this arithmetic operations, as long as you do these valid row operations, that's exactly what you're doing. So what we're going to spend Wednesday's lecture on is making sure we understand what are the valid row operations and get used to using them with the matrices and not writing the X1 X2 X3. Okay.
