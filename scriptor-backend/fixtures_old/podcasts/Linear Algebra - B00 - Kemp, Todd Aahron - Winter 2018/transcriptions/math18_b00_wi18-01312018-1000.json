The midterm starts at 8 p.m. Tonight. It's in three different rooms Galbraith Hall 242 your call to 62 and your call to 722. Whichever room you're in is listed along with your seat number in that room on Triton Ed in code so that it's short enough so that while you're walking over to revelle college and load it on your phone. It will fully display on your phone pad. So G H is for Galbraith Y6 is for your call 62622 + y 7 is for your call to 722 and your seat number is listed there if you get to the room and your seat doesn't exist, sometimes there was a seat that got broken earlier in the day or if you are left-handed and would like a left-handed desk come talk to whoever is in charge in the room right away and we'll figure out a seat for you. Okay, but we were going to start promptly at 8 so show up at those rooms early.  Before that relax eat a good dinner. Maybe at least 2 hours in advance stretch. Don't try to study starting at 6 p.m. It's not going to hell. It's just going to stress you out like whatever studying you've done up until maybe earlier in the afternoon.

Someone asked them to have to if they can write it on their iPad and print it out. Yes, when I said handwritten. What I meant is I don't want you to type it in 3.5 on to bring a magnifying glass. I want you to actually figure out what are the important things that are enough to fit only on that double sided sheets. You cannot bring any electronic devices are you can't have any electronic devices in on your desk? So your cell phone should be off and in your bag. If you're accustomed to using your cell phone as a timepiece, then you should be aware that you're not going to be able to do that that's going to be possible in the room and you have a lots and lots of time to this exam. So it shouldn't be a point of stress anyway.  You will write your exam answers on the exam sheet. Like I'm going to in a moment. Okay, don't bring a blue book. We're not using glue bucks because the exam sheets themselves will be taken and scanned into gradescope and grated there where you see your exam right away. As soon as it's graded. They will be graded by Friday. Please bring your UCSD student ID going to be checking IDs when you turn in exam and most importantly have fun tonight if that's the way I always look at exams. That's the way I want you to try to look at exam. Even if you're nervous about it. Try to make it into something try to make it into a game try to make it into something that you can have fun with and that's going to help you.  Get over any stress that you might feel about it. All right, so let's get going on actually working through one of these exams and actually so there were two that I posted and I think I'm going to go through the second one in this lecture. I'm going to go through this one.  Not you may be saying that's not the second one because I said it's version be up here. Actually, somebody asked on Piazza. There was one that said version and one that said version be not to be clear. Those were not two versions of the same exam. Those were two different exams Each of which had four versions. Okay. So someone asked if I can do version V instead of version am sure I'm going to do that. It's very similar to the Virgin a that you guys were working on already. But some of the numbers are different if you want to see the actual solutions to the version a that I posted you could look at the podcast from math 18 lecture C in Winter 2017 one year ago that I taught where I went through that it's version examined see the solutions there. Yes.  No, I'm talking about the one I'm about to do.  in the second lecture  Neither of these have I done exactly before cuz this is version V and if you look on it at 2017 you're going to see version. Hey, okay.  Alright, so let's get started. So the first thing you need to do questions zero says carefully read and complete the instructions at the top of this exam sheet and any additional instructions written on the chalkboard during the exam in particular one of the instructions the most important instruction.  Is I write your name at the top of each page of this exam. So that's what we're going to start by doing. Okay, you're going to write your name up here.  So there's my name and you going to write your student number whatever it is.  Okay, and then you're going to go through and you're going to write your name on each page.  I know it's hear some groaning. That's a terrible terrible thing. I'm asking you to do and I'm so sorry about that.  Here I changed it up a bit each time. Okay, the reason is that  You know, we're going to keep this exams together, but when we scanned them, we're going to cut off the Staples and scan them in. It's possible that a page will get shuffled around somewhere else. We need all the tools at hand to find that page if it's traveled around and somewhere else in the stack somewhere else in this can the software is good at finding your sheet by your name. If your name isn't on that page, it's possible. We won't find it. So write your name on every page.  Okay, and then we'll start now you can of course you do the questions in any order that you want. I'm going to go through in the order that they listed here. So his problem 1 consider the following system of linear equations. Is this system of linear equations 2 equations, 2 unknowns 3 equations, and there's also an unknown parameter there H, you've done lots of problems just like this. We're going to try to solve the system or say something about the nature of the solution and how it depends on H find all values of H for which the system is consistent and describe the solution set for those ages.  And so when we see a problem like this, what do we do?  Excellent row reduction. So we're going to write down the augmented Matrix corresponding that system. I see one to one.  214 + 1 - 1 H operations to take this to row Echelon form. Actually we may as well go all the way to reduced row Echelon form cuz we're going to need that in order to answer the second part of the question describe the solution set. So let me try to be as clear as possible here. I'm going to write down the row operations that I'm using. So I'm going to subtract twice the first row from the second but the results in the second row giving me the desired 0 there.  Okay.  so that gives me  1 - 4 - 3 in this lot and 4-2 is too and that far now. I'm going to subtract the first row from the second row the third row and put the result in the third row to get the desired 0 underneath there.  Okay, and that gives me -3 here.  And h- one there.  Okay, and now I've got I've got the leading entry where it needs to be in the second row, but I need to get rid of the minus 3 below that living in tree. So I'm going to subtract the second row from the third row, but the result in the third row.  And that will give me a 0 there and H -3 there.  Now this Matrix is not in reduced row Echelon form, but it's in row Echelon form, which is already enough to answer the first part of the question, which is for which values of H. Is this consistent?  What do you think guys for which values of H. Is this consistent?  No, yes.  What are those two? Anyway, yes, that's correct. For which values? Is it inconsistent? All the others? Very good, if H is equal to 3 so it let's write this so we can now say if H is equal to 3.  Then this turns into Raichu. Let's right this way if H is not equal to 3.  Last column is pivotal.  so inconsistent  Okay, so now so the answer is only H equals 3 gives us consistent. So now let's write down with this system looks like in the case of H equals 3.  I'm going to get 0 0 0 down there.  And now the Matrix is almost in reduced row Echelon form. Okay, we just need to do a couple more things. We need to Pivot that second row.  So I guess I won there I get a minus 2/3 there.  And so I have added that second row divided by -3  I know I'm going to add I'm going to subtract twice the second row from the first row for the result in the first row.  That gives me the desired 0 there.  So I'm subtracting twice. The second row I get mine is 2 * -2/3 is 4/3 + 1 is 7/3  + - 2/3 there  I know this Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form. And actually I can see that it has a unique solution. So the solution is x 1 x 2 is equal to 7/3 - 2/3.  No, I don't guarantee that I didn't make a numerical are there and if someone sees it please pointed out but if I did make a numerical are there and it says up there this problem is worth 6 points 6 points for all three parts so you can bet it's going to be about two points per part. If I made a numerical are there. Let's have got the H equals 3, right but I made in America Lehrer and I got slightly wrong Point down there. What are you going to get your going to get 1.5 out of 200 K. I'm not testing that you did the arithmetic right? I'm testing that you understand how to do the question that you have. You will lose some points if you make a mistake, but that's not the main thing that we're looking for here. Okay, but that's what I'm going to instruct the t s  Okay, find all values of H, which system is inconsistent what we actually already wrote that up here. It's so we can say okay.  H equals H not equal to 3  Those are two points.  And finally is the corresponding homogeneous system consistent. If so, describe its solution set.  Okay, what do you think is the surface of what is meant by the corresponding homogeneous system. It means set all of these equal to zero. That's the homogeneous system corresponding to this one. Is it consistent?  Yes, why?  Tell Michelle. Yes, tell me why.  Every homogeneous system always has the x equals zero solution perfect answer. So yes.  consistent  because  x equals 0 is a solution now. Is it the only solution or are there others?  Do we have to go through row operations again to answer that?  No, there's two ways. We could answer that doing the work. We've already done one is to say look if I put all zeros down the augmented call him there. It's not going to change what row operations I did and that means when I go through the whole process here, by the way, the H doesn't have to be at age is not going to have to be three.  In this case the operations on the right hand side will change right? So now it's now it's consistent for any age.  The as you noted here, but all the operations I did are going to remain the same and the only difference is that the augmented column is going to stay all zeros, which means we can be able to pick off. The solution is x 1 x 2 equals 0 0 but more importantly we can say this is the only solution  the only solution because  a in homogeneous and in homogeneous version  of the system  has a unique.  particular solution  So remember we have that they're on which says take his and how much in your system if I can find it solution then if I have any in homogeneous version of that system, it will either be inconsistent or its solution will consist of the homogeneous system translated by some particular Vector. That means that if an in-home genius version of this system has a unique solution just the particular Vector then the solution of the system must be just a zero Factor so you could answer that and lots of different ways you weren't even asked to justify this. So if you had just written this is the only solution you just written. Oops if you had just written  This is the only solution.  And this part you'll get full points here. But if you want to be extra careful and write down a justification, then this would be a good justification.  Okay, there we go. There was problem on full points unless I made an error which I don't think I did. So let's move on to problem 2.  Let a b this 3 by 3 Matrix find the reduced row Echelon form of a explicitly being asked to do row operations. So let's do that.  We've already got a zero below the leading one in the first row. So we have to just do something to the 3rd row. I'm going to subtract 3 times the first row plus the third row.  But the result in the third row.  Okay, so that gives me the desired 0 down here.  How to subtract -3 * - 5 + 3 x - 1 from one. So that's one plus 3 gives me for here. And I have to subtract 9 from 5 giving me -4 here.  Okay. Now let me go ahead and put it so I'm going to go down here. I don't want to write over my name cuz then the computer will maybe have trouble recognizing I'm going to Pivot now. I'm divided Row 2 by 2 and divided Row 3 by 4.  I know I'm going to subtract the second row from the Third.  Take me to the desired 0 there and I get a -2 here. I'm going to have it again.  Now I'm going to subtract.  the third row from the second  but the results in the second row.  Actually, let me not do what I just did to the first row cuz I save space.  And I'll symbol taneously subtract 3 times the third row from the first row.  Cancel that doesn't affect that one. It does affect the -1 that doesn't affect them as one cuz of the zero there and we get the desired 0 there and then there's just one more step which is to add the second row to the first row and put the results in the first row.  and that gives me  fat  and I get the identity Matrix as the registration form unless I made a mistake. Yes.  So you're saying that I should get a positive for in the lower right-hand corner of after the first step. So what was I doing that with subtracting three times the first row from the third row, so that means that they can - 3 * 3  what's -9 and adding it to 5 that gives me -4  Let's see the second entry. I'm supposed to be subtracting - 3 that's supposed to be adding - 3 * -1 to one that gives me a positive for so if what you said was correct. If it should have been a positive for there. Then we would have gotten a different answer down here, but it looks to me like we haven't made an error here, but please point out if we if you see one.  On the forms. I'm sorry.  I can't hear you. I'm sorry.  Yes, I said this is version B and the one I posted was version a so if you want to see the solution spelled out for a version a you can go to the podcast from 9:15 lecture see in Winter 2017 and see me do this for that person and that link is in Piazza. Let's assume that this was and we're supposed to describe the solution set of the homogeneous equation ax equals 0. What is the solution set look like?  It's x equals 000, correct? Because right here every column.  is pivotal  that means that there'll be a unique solution when one exists at all, and we know that there is a solution because it's homogeneous.  okay, how about  if we take the vector v equals 111 is this equation x equals be consistent and if so describe the solution sets. Oh guys, we should have looked at the whole question first because what do we have to do now?  We have to do row reduction again, but with this augmented call of attached. So that's a good lesson to us. We should read the whole question before we start so we can answer the first part is the equation consistent. Yes or no. Yes, because when we carry the whole thing to reduced row Echelon form  We're going to get this we're going to get this right here as the reduced row Echelon form of the coefficient Matrix. We're going to do exactly the same steps.  Okay, so that means that we're going to get a unique solution. But what is that unique Solution that's going to depend on what happens to the vector be during these row operations. They so we have to repeat it again, unfortunately, so if it's something like this happens on the exam read the whole question first, and then you could have just done Part B first and then answered Part II after work without having to do any more work. Okay. So let's start again 1 - 1/3  011  and 0 1-1 and now we have to put this one one one over there.  Oh gosh. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm copying the wrong Matrix down there. Okay, let's  And there's a common mistake that you could make I'm totally making all of these mistakes on purpose just to show you what not to do guys. Totally. Absolutely, okay.  kat103  -1 to 1  and three to five  With a 111. Okay. We doing now if you want we can do exactly the same steps. I just follow our routine from above. I'm going to reproduce them again cuz they'll be the same steps. So I'm going to subtract 3 times the first row from the third giving me the desired zero down there and that gives me a for here and a -4 there and it gives me a -2 here.  So that's the key thing we need to keep track of now is what happens to the bee vector?  Now I'm going to pivots like I did before that's going to give me 0 1 - 1 - 1/2 down here 011 and positive 1/2 here and 1 - 131 there now. I'm going to subtract.  the second row from the Third  Can you give me a -2 there and I'm subtracting - 1/2 from - 1/2 X - 1 there?  All right, and now I'll pivot.  Set another one there and 1/2 there.  Now I'll subtract the third row from the second.  I guess we have zero and that's log. That's nice.  And now I'll subtract the third row from the first I could have combined these into two one step like we didn't up above but I'll just do it separately here and that gives me so I'm guessing tractor 3. I'm going to add three times the third row to the first.  0 there  And 3 * 1/2 is 3/2 + 1 is 5/2 of there.  100 and half and then one more step and we're done.  Which is to add the second row to the first giving me the desired server there.  And that doesn't do anything to the five halves because there was a zero in the second row. So there's our solution the solution set.  is  the solution set is x equals 5/2 0 1/2  Okay, how many mistakes did I make?  What I did was to copy wrong.  Great.  Again, I totally made this mistake on purpose. Okay, so that was supposed to be a positive through there. So that means that what we did in the next step which was to at we added three we should have subtracted three times the second so that means this 5/2 what's wrong at that point. So we we should have subtracted three times the third row from the first that means 1 - 3/2 that gives you some - 1/2 there and that means and the last step again nothing changes because there was a zero there. So I think the solution is supposed to be - 1/2 0 1/2 how many mistakes now who's keeping count?  Okay, I think this is correct.  And again, this is testing that you can do row reduction. So if you did that all of this and you wrote down your steps and you got an answer that had a slightly wrong, you're not going to lose that many points again. This was worth 6 points and if there was a numerical error that you know, propagated from parte de part C, but you got the form of the answer right? Then you're going to get at least four four and a half out of six. Yes.  Which we will not lose points if you don't write down your steps, but if you make a mistake, it's going to be a lot harder for the greater to track where it happen. If you don't write down your steps, so write down your steps if you can and it's going to help you.  All right, so that was problem to that one was a bit gross to be out. If you ask me. That one was more writing than I would like to see on an exam. Okay, I didn't write this exam.  But it's testing things that you need to be able to do. So his problem 3 and let's learn error from the last one. Let's read the whole problem first to see if there's something we should do for part A that we're going to do in part C to save ourselves to writing. So here we're giving a list of three vectors SK is the set of these three vectors 11113 1 1/3 Vector which has an unknown at the moment parameter in at 31 k  For each of Parts a through C find values of K for which the set of vectors has the indicated property and here are the three indicated properties were looking for for which values of K is the start of three vectors linearly independent as part of a for which side effect of which which values of K is this set linearly dependent and for which values of K. Is this set of three vectors A spanning set for witch that does it for which K does it spend all of our three?  Okay. No first first thing we should notice. Hey, I remember that linear Independence and linear dependence are just office at properties linear Independence means not linearly dependent. So once I know how to answer a I know how to answer be at vice-versa part C is about a spanning or three that's a different property. But actually all three of these can be answered from the same form, which is we need to take the Matrix with these three vectors of columns, and we need to get it to row Echelon form. We don't need to go all the way to reduce wrestling Forum. If we go to row Echelon form will be able to see how many columns are pivotal and how many rows are pivotal and those  Answers allow us to answer these three parts. So let's do that row reduction.  Okay. So first thing I'm going to do is subtract the first row from the second. So I'm I'm going to not follow my own advice. I'm not going to write down my row operations. What I'm doing here when I say them out loud instead don't do as I do do as I say and write down your row operations. So that gives me a zero here to here and -2 there.  And I'm going to subtract the first row from the third giving me zero hear another zero there and K - 3 there.  And you know what we can stop here.  This Matrix is in row Echelon form.  It's not reduced row Echelon form. We could go to registration on phone. It's going to get a little nasty cuz we're going to / K - 3 but thinking about that that already tells us what kind of value of K is going to have a different Behavior than others.  when can we not / K - 3  when K - 3 is zero my high school math teacher always used to say if thou / 0. Shall receive one so we can't divide by zero and that of course it indicates that if K is equal to 3 so that last answer is 0 the behaviors going to be different if we try to continue with raw operations, but really what it means is we can recognize what's going on here.  So if k equals 3 then this Matrix is 11302 - 2 + 000  And that tells us that the pivotal Rose.  Are the first two they each have a pivot they each have a leading entry and the pivotal columns are the first two but the last column in the last row are non pivotal.  noncommittal  and non pivotal  if K is not equal to 3.  Then we get this Matrix here and we see that all rows and all columns.  are pivotal  many people ask this question on Piazza yesterday cuz they're still struggling a little bit with these words. What does it mean for a row to be pivotal it? So just once again reminder the definitions  you carry a matrix to row Echelon form.  And then you look for the leading entries in the Rosalita country is the first non Zero Entry reading from left to right that's called a leading entry in a row Echelon form.  Column is called pivotal if it contains a leading entry. So in this first example here, right the First Column it contains the leading entry in the first row. So the First Column is pivotal.  In the second row is living in tree is in the second column to the second column is pivotal, but the third column there it has no leading entries in it. Cuz leaving a tree in the first row is not in the third column to the first that leaving at 3 in the second row is not in the third column. It's in the second and the third row doesn't have a meeting at 3. So the third column is not pivotal.  That similarly it's hard to talk about which roads are pivotal in the original Matrix because row operations could involve roast while switch would change which rose have what properties but we can say that there is at least one row that isn't pivotal because the last row doesn't have a leading entry in a row Echelon form.  Okay. Anyway, now we know what happens here. So now we can answer the question. So when is a set of vectors linearly independent we have ethereum that tells us what's the answer. How can we tell if a doctor is a linearly independent?  Someone raised a hand to tell me.  Any of you know the answer cuz I heard you're saying it but I want someone to say it clearly. Yes.  Cracked so ask when are these linearly independent this happens? If K is not equal to 3 because they're all columns.  are pivotal  that means we can immediately answer party when it when are the vectors the street vectors linearly dependent and that happens if k equals 3.  Which is just the opposite of parte, right if they're not linearly dependent then they are linearly dependent and if you want you could write because the third column.  Is not edible.  Okay, great. And now part she asks us for which values of a question?  Would it be valid to answer that the reason is that at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others? Yes. That's an even better explanation cuz it tells you exactly that they are linearly dependent but two things first of all, this question doesn't ask you this question does ask you to just by how you got your answer. So one thing if you're going to stay that say specifically because the third column is a linear combination of the first two because otherwise what you're doing is your reiterating the definition of linear dependence and the greater might not know if you've actually checked in this example. Okay. So right as much as you can to demonstrate that you understand why you're saying it is, is it the general rule here? But yeah, that's that's exactly the point here good. And so when are when is this a spanning set now? We have a similar if I have a collection of vectors, how can I tell an R3?  Can I tell when they span R3?  Mambo Mambo Mambo hand, please. Yes.  No answered answered when is linearly independent and that's not true. Although it is true if the Matrix the square as well prove on Friday, but it's not a good explanation because it's not true in general. How can we check if a set of vectors is linear? It is a spanning set. Yes.  If every row is pivotal, so and this is so and we know when that happens looking up at our chart its 1kz is it when K is not equal to 3 K is not equal to 3 Because all rows are pivotal in this case.  Yes.  Not for a square Matrix and we'll get into this on Friday, but we did examples last week where we had a collection of vectors that span R3, but we're not linearly independent examples of vectors that were linearly independent, but did not span R3. Okay? Yes that can actually happen and we'll talk about that tomorrow on Friday. Yes.  Okay. So suppose you have a 5 by 3 Matrix years are 3 by 5 Matrix. So it's their vectors in R3, but there are five of them you want to answer if they span R3 so you said suppose you found out that the first three columns were pivotal.  Well, if there's only three rows in that means all the roads are pivotal.  So you wanted a you wanted a 5 by 3 Matrix of 5 rows and 3 columns and you're answering do those columns span R3 the answer is that question doesn't make sense.  Because that's how I won't ask it to you. But because that the columns are in our five, they're not in our three. Okay, but if you had it the other way if you had five columns in R3 and you asked do they span R3 the question is answered by figuring out if there is a pivot in every row and an example you said if the first three columns were pivotal then that means there's 3 pivots. That means that all three rows must be the only one pivot for rough.  Okay.  Any more questions about this example? Yes.  You have a 2 by 3 Matrix.  Again, if you have a 2 by 3 Matrix and you're asked if the columns span R3 the answer is that question doesn't make sense because the columns are not in our three there in our two.  This is a really important point that we need to get down and it's a super confusing point that everybody always has trouble with it first in this class for good reasons because your intuition is trying to tell you well, but maybe they're trying to tell you that you're looking for a three-dimensional Subspace in the language will learn next week. So this is all become much clearer next week, but you have to keep in mind for now that we were talking about spanning sets. The span of a collection of vectors is the set of linear combinations of those vectors if those vectors have height 3 than the span of vectors is a set of three dimensional vectors. If the vectors have hiked to then the span of vectors is a set of two dimensional vectors. It's a subset of our to it cannot span R3. It's not even in our three.  Alright now let's move on to problem for... So so far the problems have all been exactly of the form that you've done on the homework. Okay, if you can do all the problems on the homework, if you can approach any of the homework sets you did and answer the problems that you'll be able to answer these now problems.  The fourth problem is different. The fourth problem is more like those end of the section textbook exercise has the more theoretical ones that make you think a little harder. This is going to be one hard problem on the test. That's going to make you think a little harder. You're not all going to get that one Don't Panic it's there to put your feet to the fire. It's there to make you think it's there to try to get you to be creative. It's hard to be creative in a time setting not that many people are going to get full points on this problem. That's okay you're going to do well on the exam even if you don't get full points on that problem, but you should try you should work at 8. You should try think about it to see how well the concept have meshed together and you bring him. So here is the problem.  T is a linear transformation from R3 to R3  and it has the following property. What you're told is that there are three vectors 1 - 1001 - 1 + 1 0 1 and tea has the property that t the images of those three factors on dirty sum up to zero.  The question is is t121 or not justify your answer. This problem has given you lots of consternation on Piazza. So let's talk about how we will answer it. Well.  First thing I would do is write down what it means 42. B121 T is one to one.  memes  that's the equation G of x equals B.  Has zero or one solution?  for any given B  Can Arthur if I want to solve T of x equals B if I want to see if B is hit by T. Maybe it's not hit by team ABB is not in the range. So there's no solution. But if it is in the range there is exactly one point exit maps to it. That's what it means for 2 to be one to one.  Now we have a bunch of theorems the tell us how we could check if a matrix transformation is one to one. So if I knew the standard Matrix of T, I could use those theorem so that their own which says that she is one to one. If and only if The Columns of its standard Matrix are linearly independent equivalently. We're looking for every column to be pivotal just like in different context in the previous question, okay?  Do I know the standard Matrix of t?  Do I have enough information to figure out what the standard of Matrix Matrix of tea is here?  No.  The standard Matrix of tea would require us to have lots of information. It's a 3 by 3 Matrix. I do not have enough information. I'm only given one vector equation here one vector equation is not enough information to find out 3:29 numbers. Okay, even if it had that vector equation had a unique solution, it would only be enough to find three numbers unique solution to a system of 3 by 3, but we need here we would need to find an EIN number. There's just not enough information. We actually haven't pinned down. What tea is here.  So that's a clue for you to say, but if I don't know what tea is am I going to be able to show that it is one-to-one, which is a Universal Property, which says no matter what be I plug-in I get this property. Are we going to be pretty hard to check that? So that's a clue for you to say this probably means that he's asking me to show that t is not one to one because being not one to one is an easier property. So thus to show TV is not one to one.  I just need to find.  zombie  such that.  T-Rex equals B  has more than one solution.  If I can do that, then that means it's not one to one. I just need to find a single beef which that happens. It's easier to do it for single B and hint.  You can if you can do this at all, you can always do it with the zero Vector. So try be equal zero. We wants to find a non-trivial solution for the homogeneous system.  Let's see. If we can do that. Is there enough information there to tell us that we can do that? Well, we haven't done anything yet. So let's see what we know. We know that the sum of the images of T. All these three random looking vectors.  Is the zero Vector so that all the actors on the right hand side RB is on the right hand side there but it doesn't look like T of x equals B. It looks like the sum of teas of things are be but now we remember what is a linear transformation a linear transformation is a function which respects Edition so  Here we have that the zero vector.  Is equal to T of I'll just rewrite what's written there.  hopefully without mistakes  so it's equal to  don't want to have anything confusing here T of that factor plus T of that factor plus T of  not Vector, but the fact that t is linear.  Means that this is the same thing as T of the sub of those vectors.  That's the key Point here the sum of tea and some vectors is tea of the some of those factors. That's true for linear Transformations. And now I'll just add up those vectors.  I get 1 + 0 + 1 is 2 - 1 + 1 + 0 0 + 0 + - 1 + 1 is 0 so20 but the first  this is not the zero vector.  So T of x equals zero has solution.  X equals 200 is that the only solution?  Know why not?  because it also has  the solution is 000 because T is a linear transformation. So T of 0 is 0 the homogeneous system always has zero solution, but we are governed enough information here to work out that it has another one as well there for tea is not one to one.  Okay.  That is one way to approach this problem. Honestly, I think it's the only way to approach this problem.  All right, so that is full solution to that version of that practice midterm.  There are five minutes left here. I'm happy to open the floor to your questions.  Yes.  If there's a free variable in a great question if I have a matrix, is it possible for The Columns of that Matrix to that are let's say it's an M by n Matrix. Is it possible that the columns of that Matrix span RM even if there's a free variable in that Matrix the answer is yes, absolutely in general. So let's look so for example  Let's do a 2 by 3 Matrix.  Let me hear even be easier here.  So there is a 2 by 3 Matrix. So it's columns are in our 2.  Do its columns span R2 they will first it does have a free variable. Let's carry this to Rushville on form. That's just going to require a rose swap.  So now this Matrix in reduced row Echelon form so we can see that this column is not pivotal and we knew that there was going to be an aunt a little column here cuz there's more more columns and rows the can't be any more pivots than there are rows but there's more columns and rows. So at least one call him was going to be non pivotal. So if we have a system with this is coefficient Matrix, that system is going to have three variables in it.  Do The Columns of the Matrix span R2?  Yes, why?  Yes, because it's row is pivotal.  All rows are pivotal.  there for the columns  spam R2  No, the caveat is if the Matrix had been a square Matrix that couldn't have happened because if the mix before a square Matrix and there were three variable that means one of the columns wouldn't be pivotal so would be one pivot down but a square Matrix the number of columns equals the number of rows so we could also be one cuz it down in the in the Rose and it couldn't be that all rows are pivotal is a critical observation will come back to you on Friday. So if you have a square Matrix, it turns out that it's call him span or two are and wherever they are if and only if they're linearly independent, that's an amazing property, but it's only 2 per square metre who have time for one more question. Yes.  Okay for the last question, why would we try be equal zero?  The answer is you should always try Vehicles run questions like this for two reasons one is going to be easiest to work with and to it's a thorough that we'll get to later that if in a linear system if you can find multiple solutions for ax equals b x even gotten to this solution out this them already. If there is more than one solution for ax equals be for some be then there will be multiple solutions for x equals 0 right thing back to the theorem. I have an in homogeneous system ax equals be the solution set for that looks like the homogeneous solution set translated by at some particular Vector if I know that that translated set has infinitely many solutions than the homogeneous system will have infinitely many solutions. So if it's going to be not one to one you can always check that with the zero Factor.  Okay guys, have a good day. Have a great afternoon. I'm looking forward to seeing you at 8 tonight.
