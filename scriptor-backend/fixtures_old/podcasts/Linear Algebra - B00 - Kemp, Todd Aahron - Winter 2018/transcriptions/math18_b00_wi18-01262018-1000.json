So I played that little clip and I wore this ridiculous t-shirt for a reason.  Which is yesterday's lecture last days lecture and today's lecture are more abstract than the ones that we had done before and we're going to move to some more concrete stuff next week again, but these are probably the most abstract lectures that you've been to.  In a math class ever.  And in order to understand what's going on in this kind of material, you have to think like a mathematician. This is how a mathematician thinks right when a song lyrics is everybody was kung fu fighting that means oh my gosh there a lot of people around Kung Fu Fighting right? But when a mathematician here is everybody was kung fu fighting that means literally everybody in the world was Kung Fu Fighting surely that's not true. Right, but that's what the phrase means to a mathematician.  When you are reading an understanding the definitions and theorems and examples and Concepts in this class particularly in the more abstract part that we're in right now, you need to think ridiculously pedantically like this shirt because surely not everybody was kung fu fighting while know if that's what the statement says. That's literally exactly what it means. You have to interpret things overly. Literally when we have definitions like the definition of linear Independence and like some definitions were going to get to today like for a function being on two or one to one you need to read carefully and you need to think about all the Clauses in the sentence and what they mean, literally and exactly how you going to have to review that over and over as you go until it becomes second nature. Okay. That is mathematics. This is a mathematics course, even if you've taken calculus before you probably never really taken a mathematics course.  This is a mathematics course about that has a lot of mathematical thinking in it not just grinding out answers and I know you could all be successful at it but it just requires a little bit of extra mental gymnastics getting out of the habit of interpreting things colloquially and interpreting them literally. So let's keep that in mind as we proceed with another fairly abstract lecture today, but that's super important before we get there to the Matrix of a linear transformation contains talk about linear Transformations today and next week. We'll move on to Matrix operations. That's going to be a little more concrete again, but it was fitting into what we've been doing.  The cutoff for next week's midterm in terms of what materials covered is after today's lecture. So we will finish chapter one will finish with Section 1.9 today. And that is everything that's on your midterm. You've already seen the practice midterms that have been posted. Hey, they're very similar in style and length and content to what you will be working on on next Wednesday evenings midterm. Again. Your midterm is next Wednesday evening, January 31st, 8 p.m. Start time the 50-minute exam, but you'll have up to 2 hours to do it. You will be in one of the three rooms that are mentioned on the course webpage. Check Triton add to see what is your room and your seat number in that room before you arrive.  But I'll keep reminding you of that.  We also have the second Matlab homework said do tonight by 11:59 p.m. On gradescope. Make sure you submit it to the grades Golf Course corresponding to Matlab that you did last time cuz you've also got an email this week about a new gradescope course you've been enrolled in and that's the one where you will see your graded midterm appear like next week, but the way our intention is to have the midterms totally grated and I will post a provisional letter grade for you in this class before next Friday. Next Friday is the drop that drop without a w deadline. Thanks. So I want you to have as much information as possible before that deadline passes. So that's our aim. Our aim is to get there before Wednesday evening before before Friday evening to give you a professional grade based on your midterm.  And finally, you have MyMathLab homework number three due this coming Monday by 11:59 p.m.  All right. So I think that covers are administered via for today. So let's go back to what we were discussing at the end of the last lecture.  So we're talking about linear Transformations. Remember that just means linear functions functions.  From RN to RM between two Vector spaces to in 02 lists a real numbers two sets of list of real numbers.  But not just any old function functions that are linear which means that they respect the linear structure. They respect the linear operations. So there are two linear operations. That's that was our definition. We were active vectors when we to find them instead of a sort of vague a geometrically meaningful, but but not precise definition of vectors being quantities with length and Direction magnitude and direction. We were more precise here and said vectors their lists of numbers important about that will make some vectors is the vector operations that you can add two vectors and you can scale a X Factor's by scalars by real numbers.  so those are the vector operations and a linear function between vectors A linear transformation is a function between vectors that respect those operations mean that  if I want to apply that function to a sum of two vectors, that's the same thing as if I apply the function to the doctors and then add afterward it distributes across the Sun similarly. If I apply my linear transformation to a scaled Vector that gives me the same result as if I applied to the original vector and then scale it by that scalar afterward. So it commutes with our respects the linear operations some as scalar multiplication.  So that's the abstract definition of what a linear transformation is and we saw last time we spent all of last lecture studying a large class of important examples of these guys Matrix transformations.  isometric transformations  Which are those given by?  The value of the function t on the vector X you get by multiplying X by some fixed Matrix. And so if x is in RN than a has to be an M by n Matrix and then its output is an RM so that gives you a bunch of examples of linear Transformations from RN to r h m by n Matrix gives you a linear transformation from RN to RM by matrix multiplication.  Now we're going to see shortly that those are actually all linear transformation is not just a classic examples. That's it. Those are the only kind of linear transformation is there are and we can see that almost immediately best and we said at the end of last lecture. So let's reiterate what we said at the end of last lecture just a little rushed. So these properties respecting the linear operations properties. They have some consequences one for example as we noted last time.  Is that zero is always fixed by such a linear transformation. That is the image of 0 under a linear transformation is always the zero Vector that's true for Matrix transformations. Of course, we use that fact that a x 0 equal 0 we use that fact to note that all homogeneous systems are consistent because that fact that 8 * 0 equal 0 means that any homogeneous system ax equals zero has the solution x equal 0, it might have others but it always has. Solution in particular.  And then if we put these two operations together adding and scalar multiplying a group of vectors C1 V1 + C2 V2 Etc. Then we can push the T push the linear transformation through both repeatedly and get that's the same thing as c 1 x t of the 1 + C 2 x t a v to Etc down the line.  Pay for any finite list of vectors like that and that this is sometimes given the fancy name the superposition principle.  Okay. Well that has an immediate consequence.  That really helps us understand what these linear Transformations are quickly at the end of the last lecture is equal to 3.  Okay me stay consistent with the notation here and make the output RM.  So let's take the case and equal street. So we're looking at a linear transformation from R32 RN for some and might actually be real valued. I might take values in our 505 who knows what space of vectors RM?  And I want to show you a general feature of the action of a linear transformation on a three dimensional Vector. Okay that we get from the superposition principle. Well and what we saw last time is that we can just always decompose that Vector that Vector X1 X2 X3. We can always decompose it like this and we do it in two steps.  Can a composite is the vector x 100 + 0 x 2 0 + 0 0 x 3 vector addition works?  And similarly each one of those three vectors. I can now pull out the parameter like we do when we're doing parametric Solutions.  So I can pull up the X1 from the first one. That gives me 100.  Vortex 2 from the second one that gives me 001  I can pull out X3 from the third one is right that give me a 0 1 0 there and then 001 is one that comes up with the X3.  Okay. Well, that's kind of a funny thing to do unsimplified the vector X1 X2 X3, but I did it because now I can apply this superposition principle to this case right here.  And write this is Olivia pull out that scalar X1 and that's x 1 x t of 100 + x 2 * T of 010 + x 3 * T of 001.  Now what's so great about that?  What's so great about that is that I've now got these three vectors the vector tea of 100.  the vector tea of 010 and the vector tea of 001  Those are three vectors not not the ones inside their important, but the three vectors T of 100 T of 010 and T of 0:01. Let me call those vectors.  A1 A2 and A3  so I haven't told you what tea is. I don't know what T is I just know that it's a linear transformation, but given that it's a linear transformation from R3 to RN.  What I now know is that there are three special vectors these ones A1 A2 and A3 and if I have knowledge of what those three vectors are if I tell you what the image of tea is on the vectors 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 these three vectors A1 A2 and A3 if I know them then I know T. I know what tea does to every Vector because I can then calculate what tea is on any Vector X1 X2 X3. It's just given by x1a 1 + x 282 + x 383  This is very unlike any kind of functions that we study in calculus or whatever like the ones we did last lecture at the beginning that polynomial function with a sine function if I only know a polynomial and I'm not giving you the formula for the polynomial I'm saying. Hey P is a polynomial function and here's its value on three points. That doesn't tell you what the function is. It doesn't even begin to tell you what that function is. Okay, but for any linear transformation on R3, I only need to tell you what the value on three vectors and then I know what it does everywhere. I know the function that's a remarkable property.  And it's what makes linear Transformations relatively easy to work with compared to other more complicated law nonlinear functions. Just working or 3 that works for any linear transformation and it's the same sort of idea that works out here. So those special vectors 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1  Those generalize to any Dimension. So in any Dimension if I'm an RN.  There are 10 special vectors.  E1 so we give them the name z1e to up to Iain. So anyone is the vector that has a one in the one position is there is everywhere else. E2 is the best of it has a one in the two position and zeros everywhere else and so on Down the Line.  Okay, these vectors we call the standard basis vectors. We're going to make precise this term basis next week or possibly the week after so for now don't worry about what exactly that we're basis means except that in this special case. These vectors have the name standard basis vectors.  So for example in our two there are two of them.  There are two of them and they are the vectors 1 0 and 0 1.  They're the coordinate axes in our to write the unit lights vectors up and right along the coordinate axes.  There are three. Those are the ones that we just saw on the calculation on the last page.  Are the three factors 100010 and 001? Those are the standard basis vectors?  No, we're already in the business of taking collections of vectors and stringing them together as The Columns of a matrix. So let's do that with these guys if I take the standard basis vectors and string them together as The Columns of a square Matrix cuz there's going to be an of them. Why does n vectors and their height N I get a square Matrix and it's this one here 1000 in the First Column 01000 the second and so on down the line that goes up this diagonal pattern. It's a matrix that has ones down the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else that Matrix has a name that you've probably seen already and the text book called the identity Matrix in a moment. We'll explain what that is.  But given that name it's also an important Matrix that you see coming up a lot.  If you are solving a system of and equations in an announced, we have the same number of equations as unknowns, then you going to solve that system by doing.  row reduction enthusiastically  And if you want to see that that system has a unique solution. What you're looking for is for the reduced row Echelon form of the coefficient Matrix to look exactly like this is exactly the rref of the coefficient Matrix of a system that has that is consistent and has a unique solution but there's no zeros at the bottom. So, you know, you will always be able to solve ax equals be for everybody and there's no non pivotal columns are there no free variables and this is the only way that can happen. Okay, if you have a square system, this is the only form you can have for a the rear Echelon form of a coefficient Matrix if you wanted to have unique solution for every point B x equals p  Pics of it it comes up in lots of different contacts and they're all related.  What is the standard basis vectors and they are The Columns of the identity Matrix and they are by the what we did on the last slide once I know the value want to know the image of a linear transformation on those vectors. I know it's value. I know it's image everywhere. Okay, so that's the that's the theorem here and actually more than that. Not only do I sort of non-constructive Lino. Oh, yeah. I know it. I know the vector. I know the value of the transformation everywhere, but actually it's easy to compute it once I have those values and he is totally determined by the image. It takes on the standard basis vectors that what we just said and moreover.  Every linear transformation is a matrix transformation is so we saw we started last lecture all of last lecture. We were doing Matrix Transformations. And I said, let's generalize that to these abstract linear transformation. But the fact of the matter is that that wasn't a generalization at all, every single linear transformation is actually a matrix transformation and we can figure out what the Matrix is immediately I'm going to do exactly what I did on the first slide again. I'm just going to do one more step to see how that works. So let's do it again with with our three. So I have I want to figure out what my Vector what my linear transformation T. Does the vector X1 X2 X3 a generic Vector in R3  so I write it like before that's x 1 x the vector 100 + X2 X Defector 010 + x 3 x the vector 0 0 1  and let's go ahead and rewrite that using the notation. We introduced on the last slide at school that first Victory one.  a second money to the third one E34 ease of writing  using the superposition principle. This is x 1 x t of e 1 + X2 x t of e 2 + x 3 x t of III  Okay, I'll let me give those those three names. So whatever the Spectre is whatever the image of tea is on E1. Let's call that a one like before whatever the image of tea is on E2 will call that a 2 and whatever the image of tea is on III will call that a 3.  ISO rating at one more time.  if I know those three vectors  a one a two and a three  then I know tea because I can compute T of X1 X2 X3 is equal to X 181 + x 282 + x 383. We're going to go one more step and rewrite this remember the very definition of matrix multiplication.  If I take the Matrix whose columns are A1 A2 and A3.  then the definition of multiplying that matrix by the column Vector X1 X2 X3 is exactly whatever in there x 21 + x 282 + x 383  Okay, so this Matrix here.  And rewriting it again from what A1 A2 and A3 are that's the Matrix whose columns are the images of tea on the standard basis vectors.  That is called the standard Matrix of t.  If I give you a linear transformation from RN to RM you can immediately produce an M by n Matrix from it just by applying the linear transformation to the standard basis vectors that gives you an column vectors you string those I'm calling factors together to form this m by n Matrix and the theorem here is that that is the Matrix corresponding to TT is a matrix transformation. It is the Matrix transformation T of x equals 8 * X where a is that Matrix there?  Okay case closed every linear transformation is a matrix transformation and this is its Matrix.  All right, so let's do some examples.  So here's a linear transformation.  G of X is equal to X  So that's a function. It was it due to the vector EX?  There's nothing to the vector ax I start with a vector and I applied T2 it. Okay. Are you watching I'm going to apply tea to it. Okay. Did you miss it?  I didn't do anything to see because that's what tea does it does. Nothing. It keeps the vector fixed exactly where it was.  So that's we call the identity function.  Okay, cuz it's it just keeps the identity fixed of that factor now, that's a linear transformation.  Why is it a linear transformation?  Because if I let's just do the addition, right if I take T of U + V well by definition that's just U + V.  Knights OT does nothing to the vector you posed to be it keeps it fixed. But also  You is equal to T of you cuz that's fixed and V is equal to t a v.  So indeed T of U + V is equal to T of U + T of me it sort of true vacuously. It's true automatically. It's true for silly reasons. So you can do the same thing with scalar multiplication took the identity function is a linear transformation. That means by what we just said on the last two slides that it is a matrix transformation. There must be a matrix.  That multiplication by yields this identity function.  Now let's think about what size that Matrix is. So this is a function. Let's say that the vector X is an RN the output is also in our end, of course because it's the same Vector you started with.  So what's going to be the end by animatrix? And we know the standard Matrix is so that Matrix we get by taking T applied to e1t applied to e22 T apply to Ian.  That's the Matrix of this linear transformation. What does tea do to E1?  Nothing, it just leaves it as you want.  It does nothing to eat to it does nothing to eat in the standard Matrix of the identity function. Is this Matrix whose columns are the standard basis vectors right that out again? 1 0 0 0 1 0  down to  0001  That's the Matrix that we call the identity Matrix and now you know, why?  The identity Matrix is called the identity Matrix because it is the Matrix of the identity function linear transformation.  Okay.  So there is the standard Matrix of the identity function. It's the identity Matrix rotation last day another one the rotation counterclockwise by 45 degrees in the plane. So that's a function. I take any vector and I rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise means over here 45 degrees counterclockwise. I start with this Vector here and I rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise.  So that function which rotates 45 degrees counterclockwise that is another example of a linear transformation. Why is it linear should think about that a little bit? What does it mean to be linear? Remind me? What does it mean for a linear transformation, or was it mean for a function to be a linear transformation?  Yes.  It follows Edition skin irritation respects addition and scalar multiplication to say that thank you said that rotation is linear is to say that if I rotate this vector and this Vector, okay separately.  And then I add them up.  That's the same thing as adding up these two vectors and rotating that one by 45\u00b0 now that made may not sound totally obvious actually. So let's think about why that would be true. Let's draw a picture.  Okay, so here's two vectors.  Let's maybe start with that one.  And maybe one over here.  No, I'm not going to do 45\u00b0 cuz I don't want the picture to get too messy. But let's look at that rotating the vectors maybe more like a hundred 35 degrees so over here.  and then  that's something like this.  quite  approximately  Drawing isn't exactly to scale, but let's not worry about that.  Okay. So what I'm saying is for this to be linear, it has to be true that if I first rotate those those two vectors like I just did and then I add them up. Well, let's remember how to add vectors I have to do the parallelogram law.  Okay, so there's the some of those two vectors.  If I rotate and then add that's supposed to be the same thing as if I add first.  and then rotate  why is it true that you get the same answer when you add person rotate vs. Rotate first an ad it's because of the parallelogram law for addition because if I draw that first sight over there, I'd rather two notches and I add them the song is the diagonal of that parallelogram. And if I rotate the two vectors then I'm actually rigidly rotating the whole parallelogram.  Okay, I'm so when I get over to the other side, I'll get the same result as sent the diagonal of that rotated parallelogram is the sum of the two rotated factors. What's a geometric fact it's because rotations are rigid if you rotate all the vectors the same amount then you'll rotate the hole solid parallelogram as well.  Okay, so  Rotations are linear Transformations. That means that we can write down a matrix for it. And so what's the Matrix of this linear transformation that is this rotation. Let's call it a r r of X is the linear transformation Rotation by 45 degree angle. That means that this are of X is given by a x x for some make sure that Matrix is going to be a two-by-two matrix because it takes a vector in r two and spits out of actor in are too so we need to figure out what that Matrix is and the theorem tells us that that Matrix the rotation Matrix is just the result of doing the rotation to E1 as the First Column and the results of doing the rotation to eat to is the second column.  Okay, so let's figure out what those two are are of E1.  Hey, that is the rotation by 45 degrees of the first standard basis vector.  straw picture  supposed to be straight lines  So here's my standard basis vector.  And I'm rotating it up 45 degrees.  I said that one was too long. So let's actually draw a circle here that will help us.  oops  That's roughly a circle.  And so we're rotating up 45\u00b0 to that factor right there to figure out the components of that Vector. We're going to use trigonometry.  Okay, so I need to figure out what that is and what that is down here. So the X component. Well, this angle here is 45 degrees.  So this component on the right here the x-component I get by dropping down that side of the triangle which is a 45 degree right triangle.  So I remember Pythagoras theorem for a 45 degree right triangle have 45 degrees. What I what I know is that the two sides of the triangle this one and this one are the same length, and I know that there's some of those two squares by Pythagoras Theorem is one so I can work out that that means that they're right length * 1 / root 2  and so that tells us that this Vector is one of a route to one of her route to  now, what about  art of the second standard basis vector  Why just have to rotate the whole picture over his so now I need to take.  This Vector the vertical ones are A1 and rotate it over here all the way up to hike like 1 and rotated over here 45 degrees.  And so I draw the same kind of triangle.  That's why I have to drop this down and over. Well, I already figured out this height was one of our route to and buy symmetry. I'm going to get the same length down there, but it's on the negative side of the access. So this has Gordon minus one of her route to so that one is -1 of a route to one of the route to  so if I put those together the rotation Matrix is 1 / root 2 1 / root 2 in the First Column and -1 / root 2 1 / root 2 in the second column. That is the Matrix of the rotation by 45 degrees counterclockwise in the plane.  Okay, so that one was a little more computation heavy and it shows you what how and many important geometric examples. You can't even expect to get rational numbers for the entrance of your Matrix. The geometry demands therapy radicals there.  If you're aware of this but Pythagoras when he discovered what we now call the Pythagorean theorem and realize that it meant that this line here.  Write the length of the length here in this Square in this triangle its length would not be a rational number could not be expressed as a over B for natural numbers. He got really scared about this and he formed this call the Pythagorean Society of people whose job it was to go around and literally beat up people into believing that this wasn't true a phone to call the Tiger in society to protect the public from this devil truce that there are irrational numbers. He also thought it was evil to eat beans. So you might not want to take too much of what he said at face value. But anyway, there are certainly important irrational numbers. This is one of them and it comes up in the rotation by 45 degrees.  Okay.  Great. So hopefully we have a fairly good handle on how to figure out the Matrix of a linear transformation. You'll need to be able to do that on the homework. And certainly you'll need to know how to do that or that's what that's fair game for the exam.  No, I want to talk a little bit more about some properties of linear Transformations some new terminology. Again, this course a lot of this course is about language precise language remember that's why we have a vocabulary list. It was right there at the beginning that list all of the new vocabulary terms that you're going to need to know by the end of this class. Thanks. So you should be reviewing it as you go and make sure that you know and understand all the vocabulary terms that we have learned up until the place. We are in the lecture right now just to new vocabulary terms, although I hope that they're not totally new to you. You should have seen these before maybe even in high school, but we going to remind you what they mean.  And then don't fret we are going to show that these are again just slightly new language for the same concept to have seen over and over. We're going to relate it to things. We've already been doing.  So here's some more function language if I have a function and will in our case were most interested in linear Transformations. So I'll talk about those. I have a linear transformation. It is called on to  if  its range  Is the whole coda mean?  Is there a member at the beginning we talked about this distinction between the codomain to set where the maps into where the images live and the actual set of all possible images. You might not hit everything in the co donate if you actually do hit everything in the codomain the function is called on to another fancy word for it by the way is surjective. But we're going to stick with the easier to pronounce onto function. It maps onto Dakota made in other words.  for every B  in the codomain RM  there is  at least one  X in the domain  Whose image is B?  Okay.  So I'm now loading that.  t a linear transformation  Is always a matrix transformation, so it has some Matrix a and it's given by T of x equals ax.  Alternative we can say for everybody in the codomain for every being RM. There is at least one X in RN such that ax equals B.  Ax equals b as a matrix equation the kind that we studied starting two weeks ago.  And this statement that for every B, there's an X such that ax equals B is exactly the statement that that system that Matrix equation is.  I'm sorry.  Someone said something out loud, but I didn't hear what it was. Yes.  Is consistent perfect exactly. This is the statement that ax equals B is consistent for every B.  Okay are we actually have tools for figuring out how that when that strip? So this is already something that you know how to verify okay, but the important thing is the concept itself that t of x equals B can always be solved that's a statement about the function T by Bolivia transformation T. It's a statement that the whole codomain is hit by it. It's a statement that there's at least one solution for tax equals be there might be more than one we know there might be infinitely many solutions. There's this trichotomy. There's always either 0 Solutions one solution or infinitely many in the statement that t is onto is the statement that the first possibility that trichotomy doesn't happen 40. It's always consistent, but there might be more than one solution.  Okay for any B.  Now one to one is kind of a reverse of that not the opposite. It's and it's not that you can't be one to one of your on too many are both but onto is the removal of the Third Leg of the trichotomy instead of the First Transformation is called onto is this called one to one?  if  text of x equals B.  has at most one solution  For any B.  Okay, so that means in the function kind of picture in the graph kind of picture. It means that t satisfies the horizontal line test in the vertical line test. It says it's a function of the horizontal line test test if I take any B and its range, okay, and I look at the set of all X that get maps to be that's just a single point. There's only one point that not to be not like that probable function. We saw on the first day where there are lots of values that get hit twice over here in over here. That's not one to one but a function that is one to one means that for anything in its range is hit exactly once so again thinking about  The fact that linear Transformations are Matrix equation. So this is the statement that for any B.  ax equals B  Is either consistent?  Is either inconsistent?  Me neither no Solutions or has a unique solution.  So the trichotomy is your other have no Solutions one solution or infinitely many and we're saying that t is one to one means that for any be that system has only the first two possible life has no Solutions in my being consistent. That's okay or if it has a solution there's only one.  Now I got that something we know how to recognize from the system of equations from The Matrix. What it means is when you do the row reduction it means well, you know, you might get a robe zeros at the bottom and Anna doesn't like a 0 equals 5 time equation that says it's inconsistent. That's okay here that's allowed for 1 to 1. But if you don't get any inconsistency, it means you can't have infinitely many solutions. How can you recognize that's true in a system of equations. What what is it that's have to be lacking if you want to have only one solution.  Free variables great Soviet one to one is the same thing. So the Matrix of a linear transformation t with Matrix is a  that linear transformation is one to one does that statement means that the coefficient Matrix a has all columns pivotal.  It means that when you write down the system a b.  You find that there are no free variables which isn't a statement about be right that that's going to be a statement about a alone.  Okay, so these are the ideas onto and one-to-one onto means that ax equals B always has a solution for every B, but there might be many.  121 means that ax equals be always has at most one solution. It may not have a solution. But if it does it's Unique and in terms of stuff, we've already done all that means this is onto means that x equals B is consistent for every B.  And we can recognize that again in the reduced in the Russia one form of a remember what the condition is 4X equals V to be always consistent someone on the side of the room.  Maybe not someone in the middle of the room.  Yes.  I see there's no pivot in the augmented column. Does that mean that x equals B is always consistent. Remember the augmented column is where B lives so that's going to be a statement about be so that's not the right condition that says something else. What does that one? Say when a when there is a pivot in the in the last of method column that says that the system is inconsistent, right? That's that's an important condition, but not the one we're looking for right now. There was a hand over here behind you.  Every rose has a pivot. That's correct. Okay, if you want ax equals be to be solvable for every be if you want there to be a solution for every be then there can't be any rows of zeros at the bottom because if there are you going to be able to arrange it with some be so that in the registration form that last row with the augmented Matrix says 0 equals 76 which is these are things that are now going to be easy to actually recognize how can you tell if a matrix transformation a linear transformation is one to one.  It's 121 precisely if there are no free variables every column is pivotal, how can you tell if it's on to you check to see if all the rows of the coefficient Matrix a are pivotal Panthers a pivot in every row transformation is a matrix transformation transformation. There it is.  This Matrix is 2 by 3. That means that this is a linear transformation from R3 to R2.  I said this goes from R3 to R2.  Okay, so I went to answer the two questions is this guy one to one is it onto?  So to answer those questions as we just said we need to look at a row Echelon form of the coefficient Matrix of the standard Matrix of linear transformation.  But I've been kind here. I've given you a matrix that happens to already be in row Echelon form. So we should be able to answer these questions right away first question about being on too. That's the statement the ax equals be so this is a equals B has a solution for every B, which as we just said is the statement that every row is pivotal is every Row in this Matrix pivotal. Yes, there's no rose of zeros at the bottom in Russian on Farm every route is pivotal. So every row  It's pivotal.  therefore T is onto  okay. Now we need to check if it's 1 2 1 1 2 1 is the statement that x equals B has no solution or a unique solution which has we said is a statement that there are no free variables in the system pay if I were to augment this with Abby there be no free variables and that means we're looking for every column to be pivotal.  Is every column here pivotal?  No, and actually we don't even need to look at the reduced row Echelon form or anything for this Matrix. We already knew that just from the size this Matrix has more columns and rows.  There are two rows that means there can't be any more than two pivots. There are two in this example that might only be one in some example of that size. But whatever the case there can't be three right there can't be a third because there's only two rows but that means that one of those three columns will not have a pivot in it. So in this case, it's the third one the third one.  this column  is not pivotal.  They're 40 is not one to one.  Okay. Now that example might give you the mistaken impression that one to one and onto or opposing doctors write that if you're one to one you can't be onto if you're onto you can't be one to one. That's not true.  There's something else going on here that makes it like that in this example. We know that if you have a matrix that is wider than it is tall. Then the columns can't all be pivotal by the same argument. We just gave means that if you have a matrix is wider than it is tall. It's never going to correspond to a one-to-one later transformation. It might be onto like this one or it might not that's a question of whether there are any roads of zeros at the bottom in a row Echelon. So it's true that this kind of guy can never be one to one. That doesn't mean you can't be both one-to-one and onto so for example, every rotation every rotation in any Dimension is both one-to-one and onto it's a one-to-one for a rotation means that okay. Look I got my Rotation by 45 degrees.  Came out. So here. I'm telling you. Here's a vector and I got it by rotating 45\u00b0. What's the set of all vectors that it could have been but I rotate it to get there but there's just one cuz I can rotate back 45 degrees. I can go in reverse and it's also on to because every Vector comes from some vector by rotation again because I can go in reverse being one to one and onto means that you can reverse the land transformation means that it has an inverse and we'll get to that next week. So that's a critical point here being one to one and onto it's possible to be both.  It's possible to be one and not the other like in this example here. It's also so it's possible to be onto but not one to one. It's also possible to be one to one and not onto so here's an example of here.  So first of all, let's check to see if it's on to like before well being on two means that there's a row there's a pivot in every row without doing any calculations. Is there a pivot in every row know because there's more rows and columns. So they're just can't. Aren't Enough pivots to go around no pivot in one row and at least one row.  Therefore they're forty is not onto.  Now that doesn't mean that it's 121. It might also fail to B12 want there are lots of linear Transformations that are neither one to one neuron to what's the condition for checking if it's one to one we need to see that every column is pivotal.  So to check that we would probably have to do row reduction here.  Only one step up maybe two steps of it, but actually we don't need to because let's remember the content of Mondays lecture will be introduced linear Independence. So linear Independence remember means that two vectors are and vectors are linearly independent if there's no non-trivial linear combination of them that give the zero vector  But we boil that down to what it said about the Matrix his columns are those vectors and saw that linear Independence means?  The Columns are all pivotal but that's also the condition. We just gave her being one to one. So we have a new theorem.  Connecting all the concepts we've done in the last couple of weeks a linear transformation is one to one. That's the same thing as saying that it's columns are linearly independent.  now in general if you want to check for The Columns of a matrix is linearly independent, you do the same thing you do when you answer any question, which is  Oh great. There was actually some enthusiasm there. Thanks. Yes row reduction, but there's a special case here that we talked about. If you have two vectors, it's actually easy to check just by looking if they're linearly independent linear the end of their linearly dependent linearly linear dependence for two vectors means that they are parallel are these two vectors parallel? No not a chance to get the second from the first that have the X 3 in the first component, but if I'm up by 7 by 3, I don't get 5 so these vectors are not parallel.  Therefore they are linearly independent there for all columns.  are pivotal  And therefore T is one to one.  So that's it. We connected all of the concepts together. So let's just finish by stating once again with stated have several times in the last 10 minutes. So here's our Theron. I have a linear transformation between RN and RM fan its Matrix is a standard Matrix is a so that enough is onto if and only if  the rose of a  Are all pivotal.  Which is the same thing as saying that ax equals B has is consistent.  for every B  Auntie is one-to-one, if and only if the columns  of a  Are all pivotal.  Next to let me move this down to make a little little more space here The Columns of a are all pivotal which is the same thing as saying that the columns.  Of a are linearly independent.  And then the third statement I wanted to make up here the rose of a are all pivotal. That's the same thing as saying that the columns.  of a span RN RM the output space  Okay, if you look back in your notes from to lecture to go that's what we said. So there we have it one to one and onto function Concepts but their new language for the same questions. We've been answering using the same tools row reduction. Have a good weekend. See you Monday.
