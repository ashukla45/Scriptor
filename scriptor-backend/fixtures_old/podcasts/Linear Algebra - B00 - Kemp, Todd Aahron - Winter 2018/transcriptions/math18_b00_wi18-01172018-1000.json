And then if you get into the class, then we will enroll you in time for you to upload it and if if the timing doesn't work out in your late because you weren't enrolled in time. Don't worry. We will take care of that this time. Okay, we're not going to give you a zero on that assignment because we couldn't enjoy on the class until the last minute will will make sure that works out. So don't worry about that. Let me briefly take that Segway to mention. They're still 80 people on the waitlist for my two lectures and the reality as you're not all going to get into the class there are restrictions.  Place by the fire marshal we cannot overload the class two more than 10% of the room capacity if we do and if we are Marshall comes in next week, which you probably will do and see is 20 people sitting in the aisle else. He will shut down Center Hall for the whole day. That's the threat that we've been told and so they really don't want us to overload the class more than 10% I wish we had another lecture for you guys to go to the reality is that if you're really far down the waitlist at this point, you're probably not going to get into the class this quarter and if that happens then email me after you don't get in the class and we'll make sure that you get preferential enrollment opportunities next quarter or the next quarter you want to take it. Anyway, that's all going to be finalized tomorrow to buy Friday. You will know for sure whether you were in the class or not and will get in as many of you as we are allowed to  Okay, so that's all I wanted to say administratively today.  If you're coming in now, there are a few more seats. I see two seats over here three seats over here a please try to sit in the seat and not in the aisles.  Without disturbing those around you. So please try to make sure you come early to this class as it's still going to be oversubscribed for a while.  Alright, I'd like to continue now with what we're doing last day. So today we're going to be doing Vector equations and Matrix equations sections 1.3 and 1.4 in your textbook will continue with  More detailed description of solution sets of linear systems that we have more language to do. So on Friday's lecture section 1.5. I want to start today with a review from the side that we finished with last day.  I said there were two new pieces of terminology that we learned last day linear combination and span we're going to be using those words every lecture from here until the end of the quarter. So you need to make sure you are totally comfortable with them and you might not be right this minute, but you should be hopefully by the end of the lecture and if not, that means you need to review and do lots more problems to get comfortable with them. So linear combinations are vectors that are constructed from other vectors using the operations that Define what it means to be a vector vector things we can add and scalar X have some collection of vectors here app called them you want you to to un and might be seven and might be a million of these are vectors in some space some call him space.  I said they might be 10 dimensional vectors. That might be two dimensional vectors.  The given some collection of vectors you once were you in a linear combination of them is a Psalm of some scalings of those vectors. So we take the vectors we multiply them by some skill and multiples and we are those scale vectors together. That's a linear combination. So for example, there's two factors that we had last day but her - 1 1 and 2 once they're both two pictures in our two.  And I am going to add up a scalar multiple of the first risk elements. Will the second to give some linear combination? So for example, let's do  Let's do -2 times the first Spectre plus the second factor. That is an example of a scalar multiple. Let's graphically see where that fits on this picture here. So I want to multiply the first Factor the red vector by -2  that means  let me do it in a darker line here. That means this Vector here.  Hey, that's - 2 X - 1 1.  I want to add that to the blue vector and we use the parallelogram law which says oh, I just construct the parallelogram with those two as two of its sides. Okay, and that means that I'm going to  connect  These two and the sum, is that Vector there.  Now we could read off what the coordinates are there by counting and looking at the Cartesian grid, but this is not really the best way to compute linear combinations.  Really? All we have to do is use the vector addition and multiplication rules and say look - 2 X - 1 1 that means I multiply the components by -2 giving me 2 - 1 that's 2 * 2 - 2  plus 2 1  Announce to add vectors I add the components.  So 2 + 2 is 4 - 2 + 1 is -1 so that better over there. It's coordinates are 4-1.  So that is an example of a linear combination there infinitely many linear combinations of these two vectors. I can put any scalar and for the first and it's killing for the second and add them up and that gives me a linear combination of the two factors. So we're interested in the set of all possible linear combinations of those two vectors and that is what we call the span to the span of a collection of vectors. Do you have some collection of actress Russell usually be a finite set of vectors and if you got your three vectors and vectors like you once were you in and the spelling of those vectors or sometimes the textbook uses the term the span generated by those vectors is the set of all linear combinations of them. So it's all vectors that can be written down as some linear combination of those factors.  Hey, that's this man. So that one there that I just threw the vector 4 - 1 is an example of an element of the span. It is in the span of those two vectors. Somebody want to give me another example of a vector that's already on this picture that is in the span of those two vectors.  I guess the answer to that is no to somebody want to so I'm going to ask you to yes.  Sorry, excellent. The zero Vector is always in the span of any set of vectors and anonymity set a vector cuz I could just take all the scale of coefficients to be 0 0 * 1 + 0 * the second one gives me the zero Vector that's always in the span and any other vectors that are already on this picture that are in the span of the original two vectors.  Yes.  Good the vectors themselves. He said minus-11. The vectors themselves are always in their own span of a vector - 11 is in the span of -1 one and two one because I could take the coefficient of the first one to be one and the second one to be zero K so I can always get the same vectors back by taking a one in front of the vector. I'm interested in in 00.  Any other vectors besides - 1121 and the one we were John 4-1 and 0 that are already on this picture.  Other is at least one more Vector that's drawn on the board. It's the vector - 2 X - 1 + 1 is that in the span? Absolutely cuz it's mine is two times the first + 0 times the second. So those are some examples of vectors in the span. But the span spans a much larger set of vectors. It's always an infinite set unless you only had one venture to start and it was the zero Vector if you just have the zero Vector to start then you're only adding it to itself and you multiply a zero vector by a scalar you just get zero so that case in Spanish just the zero Vector but in all other cases if you ever have at least one nonzero Vector in your list, the span is an infinite set.  So in this case, you can probably guess and will be able to verify this in a few minutes that for those two vectors. The span is actually the entire plane. It's all are to every two dimensional Vector can be achieved as a linear combination of those two vectors in a unique way.  How would we prove that? Well, let's look at an example that's going to show how what how this concept of span relates to everything. We've been doing so far in the class.  There's a question. There's a vector 7 4-3. It's a vector in r  and our sneeze in our what are three cuz it's a list of three numbers. The question is is it in the span generated by those two vectors that 1 - 2 - 5 + 256 is it in the span so we can answer that question. Can anyone tell just by looking?  No, but if you can I'd love to hear your explanation, but no you cannot tell just by looking at all. It's a really hard question. If you if you try to do it naively without any mathematical tools know we could try to answer a geometrically by drawing very careful pictures. So those two vectors there 1 - 2 - 5 let's suppose that that Vector is this Vector here in space to my torso is the origin and that second Vector 256. Let's suppose that it's over here. So if I drew a picture very carefully was the two vectors look like that anyone tell me geometrically what the span of these two vectors looks like  Yes a playing which plane?  Is it the plane of the floor is at the plane of the wall?  Yep, that's the plan of the two vectors lie. That's probably the best answer you can give but it's this plane here. Okay, you can have to imagine there's a unique plane that passes that these two vectors are in. There's only one. That's the span of these two vectors. My head is not in the span of these two vectors in the vectors putting us through my head is not in the span of his two vectors. So if that was represented by my head, it would not be in this pain, but maybe that matter is down here. Maybe it is in this bad that you could try to draw the picture very carefully to guess whether that's true. But first of all, I bet not many of you are talented enough artist to make that convincingly work. I'm certainly not not going to try but really that's not the right way to do it here we want to do this mathematically.  So we revert to the definition. What is it we're asking.  The question is Ken.  Eye Express  not vector  74 - 3  in the Forum  I want to know whether I can write as a linear combination of these two vectors over here. Meaning. Can I find some scalar X1?  and some scalar X2  So that 74 - 3 is equal to x 1 * 1 - 2 - 5 + x 2 x 2 5/6 if that's the question in other words. I want to solve I want to ask whether I can solve the following vector equation.  Hey, this is a vector equation is an equation between two vectors. And what were solving for are the coefficients X1 and X2. Can we find coefficient X1 and X2 so that this equality holds true?  If so, then what that says is that that Vector 74-3 is in the span of these two, it is a linear combination of those two.  Now you see why we've been talking about the important question of giving a linear system. Can I answer the question? Does it have a solution right without necessarily finding the solution because that's what we need to answer here. Does this vector equation have a solution? I'm not asking you to find the solution. I'm asking you just answered. Does it have a solution or not. Now? This is the vector equation not exactly what we've been writing as a linear system of equations, but it actually is exactly the same thing because let's use the vector operations to rewrite this so x 1 x at first Spectre is x 1 - 2 x 1 - 5 x 1  And x 2 x i II Vector is 2 x 2/5 x 2 6X 2.  and now let me use the rule for how I add vectors component by component to write this out as the first component inspectors x 1 + 2 x 2  -2 x 1 + 5 x 2 + -5 x 1 + 6 x 2 so I'm asking can I find X1 and X2 so that the vector with those three components components that are written in terms of the variable x 1 x 2 is equal to the vector with the components 74-3 knowing what we know about vectors two factors are equal means that their components are equal right the first composer the first factor in the first part II Vector equal on so on. This is exactly just a system of linear equations. It's the system x 1 + 2 x 2 equals 7.  -2 x 1 + 5x to equals 4 + -5 x 1 + 6 x 2 equals -3 system of equations 3 equations in two unknowns  How do we solve such a system?  Row reduction. Someone says weekly come on. I want everybody to say that answer every single time. How do we solve such a system?  Row reduction. Okay, you're going to get excited about it by the end turn it to you. But actually before we do row reduction, we need to translate this into the augmented Matrix form first, right? So let's do that.  We would write the augmented Matrix just by putting the coefficients 1/2.  7 - 254 + - 5 6-3 we have a question. Like we've been working on the last for lectures three lectures.  That I really need to go through all of that mess of notation and write down the vector equation work it out right down the linear system and convert it to the augmented Matrix. Anybody see how we could have taken a shortcut knowing what we need to do now look up here at the top.  look at those two and  that one and I'll look down here.  If you are asked is the certain Vector in the span of his other vectors to answer that question, all you need to do is string those vectors together in an augmented Matrix with The Columns of the bank of the coefficient Matrix being the ones that you're asking do they spend this other vector and the vector you asking is it in the span it goes on the right hand side of the equal sign. That's the trick here. So when were asking such a question, we just write down the augmented Matrix immediately. And now now we do  Row reduction. Okay. So let me do the reduction here for practice. So I'm going to try to get a zero below the leading one in the one 1 entry in the second row and the third row seat for the second row. I'm going to add twice the first row to the second row for the result in the second row.  That's going to give me my desired 0 there that's going to give me a 9 here and it's going to give me an 18 here.  And then simultaneously I'm going to do the third row which means I'm going to multiply the first row by 5 and add it to the third row for the result in the third row giving me the desired 0 there and that's going to give me 16 in the second position and 32 in the third position.  Okay, so now I've got my zeros below the leading one in the First Column. Next thing I need to do is well, I can do a number of things, but I'm going to convert this to a leading one in the second column.  So I'm going to divide road to by 9.  Get 1/2 there.  I know is this Matrix in row Echelon form?  No, yes, or no.  Does everybody stand up?  The energy in this room is too loud. Everybody stand up.  Okay, we're all going to do five jumping jacks right now ready and one.  Okay, let's try that question again.  Is this Matrix in row Echelon form?  Because there is a 16 below the one there.  Right. So the leading entry of the third row is not to the right of the leading entry in the second row. So what are we got to do got to get rid of that 16?  So I'm going to multiply.  Road to buy - 16 added to roast 3 put the result in Row 3.  and I get  what well, I got the desired 0 there and 2 * 16 subtracted from 32 is 0.  This Matrix is in row Echelon form not in reduced row Echelon form. But remember, all we want to answer is is the system consistent doesn't have a solution.  Does this system have a solution?  Absolutely. There's a row of all zeros at the bottom. There's no 0 equals 5 type and consistency. So the system does have a solution third final augmented column is not pivotal there for the system is consistent.  And so we can answer the question is the vector 7 4-3 in the span of those two vectors. Yes or no. Yes.  Because the associated system is consistent.  No, in fact we could go further and say look I've actually already solve for x 2 x 2 is equal to 2 and I could do back substitution here to solve for x one or I could take it one more step to reduce trash lawn farm and I'll see that it is uniquely soft.  Okay, so we could say not only is it in the span but there's only one way to write it in this pain there to Unique coefficients X1 and X2 that will make it in the span.  What if  I had gone through all of this and instead of a zero down here suppose that I had gotten like a V down here.  Then what would the answer to the question have been?  No, because that would say oh the third column is pivotal. That means there's an inconsistency R equals 5 type equation here. In fact 0 equals 5 and the system is inconsistent, which means that no by definition. You cannot write that Vector 7 4-3 as a linear combination of the first two  Okay, everybody got that.  That is Vector equations. And that is how you determine whether a vector is in the span of some others.  And it's just different language for stuff. We've already done a vector equation is just a different way to write some linear equations and questions about linear combination and span of vectors immediately translate two questions of consistency for those Associated systems of linear equations.  Okay, so that's a factor equations.  So just to emphasize the point. I just made the question is W in the span of vectors V1 V2 in VN is the same as the question is the system whose augmented Matrix you get by putting the vectors V1 through Vienna's The Columns the left and W as the augmented column. Is that system consistent?  Hey, that's the equivalent population and how we actually compute these things to answer this question. We use.  row reduction  to carry this augmented Matrix 2  Row Echelon form you don't need to go to all the way to reduced row Echelon form just to answer the question. Is it consistent?  And we check to see if okay. Well and here's the thing. I want you to remember. What is the technical condition in row Echelon form that tells you whether or not the system is consistent by show of hands somebody.  Yes.  The final column is not pivotal check to see if the augmented column.  Is pivotal or not if it is pivotal that means you get an inconsistent equation and the system is inconsistent. If the final column is not pivotal the system is consistent. So that's the whole story on how you determine mechanically if a vector is in a span of the others that's a lot easier than trying to draw careful pictures to see if a certain Vector looks like it's in the plane that generates that is generated by two given vectors.  So that's the whole story on Vector equations.  So now I want to go to section 1.4 and talk about Matrix equations, which if you read ahead, you know also is just slightly different language for the same thing. It's going to reduce to linear equations. But first we need to talk about what we mean by a matrix equation.  Enter together. We need to understand matrix multiplication. How many people saw some something about matrix multiplication before this class?  Okay, a healthy healthy plurality of you at least.  So I knew already had in the book. So you've already seen this, but I'm going to show you the definition again.  So we can multiply matrices together if they have the right sizes for now. We're going to talk about multiplying a matrix times a column Vector. So if I have a matrix  An M by n Matrix, we always use those letters m by n which is a travesty because it's very hard to hear the difference between M and N so we should really call the peel iqmetrix, but the textbook uses Eminem. So so does every textbooks I'm going to say an M by n Matrix is a rectangular array that has M Roseanne n columns the first number there to don't, you know, tell me Rose there are and then second number and the notes the number of columns.  So suppose we have an M by n Matrix, which means that I could think of it as stringing together and column vectors.  kind of column vectors r m High  dimensional vectors. I have a vector ex which is an n-dimensional Vector ex has to actually have number of components equal to the number of columns in a knot to the number of rows that's critical care if the Matrix is square, then there's no difference, but we have to be careful. So suppose I have such an A and such an ex.  So another words of the column Vector whose number and adventurous matches the number of columns.  Hey.  Then we can multiply 8 * X and here's how that's defined. And this makes it immediately clear why the number of entries of X has to equal the number of columns of a by definition a X Tax is computed just by using those components X.  and multiplying them by The Columns of a  Okay, so really matrix multiplication is just a shorthand notation for linear combinations. So I want to say look I've got these vectors A1 through a.m. And I want to take a particular linear combination of them with coefficients X-14 X-Men one way to write that down is to write it as the Matrix a whose columns are those vectors times the column Vector where I put together the components X1 X2 through accent.  Hey, that's the definition of multiplying a matrix times a column Vector of the appropriate size. So for example, here's a matrix right here.  What size is this Matrix?  3 by 7  We buy too good so it has three rows to columns. So m is equal to 3 and is equal to 2. So this column Vector here is it have the side right size to be able to do this matrix multiplication?  Yeah, it has two entries. So that matches the number of columns so I can do the matrix multiplication and by definition that just means I take the first entry for * the First Column Vector in The Matrix.  I take the second entry 7 * the second column entry in The Matrix and I do the vector scam application Edition. So I get four times to which is 8  + 7 x - 3 which is -21 for the first entry second letter is 4 * 8 which is 32 + 7 * 010 + 1/3 + 3 is 4 x - 5 which is -20 + 7 x 2 which is 14.  and so I get 8 - 21 is -13  32 + -6  I didn't make any mistakes.  So that is the result of multiplying that 3 by 2 matrix by that two-dimensional column vector. And that's the definition of matrix multiplication. Again, it's really just a shorthand for doing the appropriate linear combination of The Columns of The Matrix.  Okay. Alright, so I meant to erase this competition here before lecture so I could do it in front of you. But you know what it's already written there. So let's just look there's a second example, if we don't need to run through it, you can check it later. So here is a 3 by 3 Matrix has three rows and 3 columns. That means that I can * a three dimensional vector and the definition is just I take the first component four times the First Column plus the second component three times the second column plus the third column the third entry seven times the third column and do the vector operations and added and there's the arithmetic which I don't really need to do in front of you but you should do several examples like this to make sure you've got it straight.  So that's matrix multiplication.  Hey, but let's also go backwards and that's going to give us some good intuition about how much medication can be used to relate to linear equations.  So for example I said that matrix multiplication is just a shorthand way for expressing certain linear combinations. So let's do that supposed to give you three vectors. I'm not telling you what they are. Here are three vectors you want you too and you three there column vectors of some size.  I want you to write the linear combination. That's written there as a matrix product as a matrix multiplication.  I would like you to tell me what is the column Vector that we're going to use in this matrix product. So I'm going to give you 10 seconds to work that out and then I'm going to ask for an answer here glad.  You can talk to your neighbor as usual if you like.  So just to be clear what I'm asking here is I want you to write this thing.  As a matrix a x a vector X and I'm asking you what is that Vector X that you're going to use?  Give you another 10 seconds.  Start the somebody think they know what Vector to use their.  Yes.  437  Where you getting 437 from?  Oh, yeah, so I know that's so this example of here has nothing to do with this example down here.  But I was a quick turnaround it for you. Yes to -3/8 right? That's very important here. I'm sorry. If there was any confusion that you want you too and you three are not The Columns of the Matrix up there and have nothing to do with these vectors you and you too and you three they could be 78 dimensional right or they could be yesterday's closing closing soft stock prices from the S&P 500 or whatever. They are. They I don't care what they are. I'm just asking you to find the vector that I'm going to use in this matrix product here and the answer. I was just giving is 2 - 3/8 that is the answer I was looking for because we can write this thing as I string together the columns. I don't know what they are. But I just write them as U1 U2. He was three.  Time is the vector 2 - 3/8.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter that I don't know what dimension The Columns you want you to and you three are that was my point here.  I don't know. What M is for this Matrix. I don't know how many rows there are but that linear combination can be written as the Matrix whose columns are those vectors time is the vector 2 - 3/8. I don't need to know the size of the Rose to be able to do the matrix multiplication. It just needs to be that the column Vector EX.  has number of components equal to the number of columns in The Matrix a  the matrix multiplication again to summarize is just a concise way of representing linear combinations.  Alright, so now we know what makes multiplication is and how to do it now. We can talk about Matrix equations.  So let's go back way back to your first introduction to algebra probably in 7th or 8th grade, depending where you from could be earlier could be later.  The most basic algebra equation is the equation ax equals B for some corporations A&B solve 2x equals 3, something like that. You want to solve for x?  How do you solve that system? How do you solve ax equals B for x?  Row reduction good answer. It's true.  The Matrix is a 1 by 1 Matrix and the the demented part is be so you have a matrix AV  Hey, this is equivalent to the linear system. The augmented Matrix a b.  How do we answer whether we can solve that? How do we solve that? We have to convert it to reduced row Echelon form?  Which it almost is already. We just have to Pivot turns that a into a one right so we have to divide through by a on that row and we get that and that's the solution x equals V over a we do you were doing and seventh grade on one by one systems of equations because of a has zero we can't do that. I did indeed if a is zero then that system is generally not solvable. They have zero. It says 0 equals B, which has a solution only if B equals. Otherwise, it's inconsistent.  Okay, so that's the most basic algebra equation. It is an example of a linear equation.  So now let's look at a matrix generalization of this so suppose. I have a matrix A and M by n Matrix and a vector be in our a case of beef is going to be a vector that matches The Columns of a not the number of columns, but it has to have the same height as The Columns of a  the question is can we solve The Matrix equation ax equals B 4X. We want to find a vector X or answer the question. Is there a vector X so that a x x equals B?  Now in order for that to make sense, you see he has to have the right size to start because a x x is going to be a linear combination of The Columns of a which means it's going to be a vector in r m and so for that equation to even make sense for a vector in r m equal a vector in the vector BB has to be a vector in r m we couldn't solve we could even ask the question. Can you solve x equals B if x is a vector in R 7 and V is a vector in R3. There's no way to make sense of that those objects live in different spaces sizes match up then we can at least ask the question.  Can I solve a system of equations? Can I solve this Matrix equation?  So let's do an example to demonstrate how this is really exactly a question. Like we've already done everyday so far. So here's an example ax equals B. We're going to solve the system with a equal to that 3 by 3 Matrix there and be equal to that three by one column vector.  So if I want to solve this, let's write it out very explicitly ax equals B.  Okay, this means I'm multiplying 1 2 3 4 - 4 to 6 - 327 * this unknown, Vector X1 X2 X3.  So let's use Matrix multiple. That's use the definition of matrix multiplication. That means I take x 1 x the first column 1 - 4 - 3 + x 2 x the second column 322 + x 3 * the third column for 6 7  and I'm asking can I solve this? Can I find X1 X2 and X3 so that that equals B.  Which is 101 in this case, so this Matrix equation has become what kind of equation?  The kind that we studied two slides ago, which would called a vector equation. So a matrix equation is a vector equation. It's just a different way of writing down a vector equation.  And now we do what we did to solve that vector equation, which is well, we could continue to write it in converted to a system of equations and then write down the augmented Matrix for that system of equations or we can jump straight away from here or directly from here. And now that we know how this works and we just write down the system 1 3/4 - 426 - 3 2 7 with augmented column 1 0 1  I know.  We solve the system by doing row reduction.  Okay, so now we do row operations.  To get to row Echelon form.  To answer the question of whether we can solve the system and if we want to actually find the solution or Solutions if it's consistent, then we have to do reduced row Echelon form to find the solution.  If the system is consistent.  And if it is not consistent, then we're in the situation like we mentioned up above where a was equal to 0 right in that case. We can't solve the system unless were the special kids will be was also know we know for matrices that is a little more complicated that it's not just a question of whether at the Matrix a equal 0 or not. We can get different kinds of inconsistencies solution, but we we can get you know, we could have the whole Matrix aa-101d was not that would certainly be inconsistent. But really the question is when we reduce this may try to relax one form do we get zeroes in the coefficient part and a nonzero thing on the right hand side if that happens. We know it's inconsistent. So it's a more complicated set of criteria for whether the equation is consist. It has a solution or not, but the idea is exactly the same.  So I'm not going to go through the actual reduction here. I think we've done plenty of reproduction already and will certainly do more but you know what to do. Now, we would multiply the first row by 4 and add it to the second to get a zero below that leaving one and do most of the first throw by 3 to add to the third to get the zero under that leading in the third row and proceeded to get that nice staircase were looking for so that we are in row Echelon form to check whether the final column is pivotal. If it isn't that the system is consistent. We know we'll be able to find a solution set a solution set and produce an exact description of it by doing all the way to reduce Russia want form.  And you've already been doing lots of examples of that on your homework. So that's what you do from here. So that's Matrix equations.  And so let's summarize again what we just said and what we saw in that example. So suppose I give you a matrix equation ax equals B, and I'm assuming the things are lined up here so that the size is matched so that it's possible to x x x o x is it seems to be a vector whose number of components is equal to the number of columns in The Matrix A and B is a vector in the same space as The Columns of a it's a vector whose components is equal to the number of rows of a then we can even ask the question is ax equals be solvable and the answer is x equals we can be solved if and only if B is a something of The Columns of a  Let's look back at the other slide.  Okay, look right here.  Right here.  so remember that that system of equations  The Matrix equation x equals be in this case becomes this vector equation and this vector equation saying that the sector equation is solvable says of the vector 101 is a  Linear combination of The Columns of a that's what it means to say that x equals B. It means that x equals B is solvable if and only if B is a linear combination.  of The Columns of a  and just to emphasize the point that we have a word for this the set of linear combinations of a collection of vectors is called the  span  avocado survey  Stop, by the way, just in case this symbol is is messing you up this symbol here. The script ee thing is just pronounced in it means element of it takes just as much time to write it as writing in I would prefer to just write in but your textbook uses the symbol at the standard mathematical symbol. So you need to make sure you get used to it.  So for example, let's look at this Matrix a here that by the way is the same Matrix we had over here. That's the Matrix a from the last slide. And by the way, let me tell you that the answer in this case if you actually go through it the answer is yes.  And moreover the reduced row Echelon form.  Of a of that system look like this.  Hey with some things on this side. If you go through it, you'll see that's what it looks like.  Okay.  so knowing that  Can you solve ax equals be here for some other be is the question?  Hey, so suppose an actually a more delicate question here is I know what to do for a specific example. I want to answer the question. Can I solve ax equals B where a is a specific Matrix and B is a specific column vector.  But not want to answer the slightly stronger question. Can I solve ax equals B for any choice of B?  Or are there some bees for which it doesn't work? No, remember?  As we set up above the question of whether x equals B can be solved is the same as the question of whether B is in the span of The Columns of a everybody is a linear combination of The Columns of a example. We did at the start of the lecture. I had two vectors in three dimensional space. The answer was certainly going to be no to the second question because the span of these two vectors is a plane in three-dimensional space and there will definitely be vectors like my head sticking up here that are not in that plane.  So there will be some vectors like this one that are in the span and some vectors many factors that are not so this question can a sequence be be solved for any be that question in that case is has the dancer no.  But what about in this example here? I have three vectors in three dimensions. Now, that doesn't mean that those vectors are going to spend all of our three for example, take the vectors this line.  The line along the line along the the bottom of the chalkboard here and this line here this Vector here. So these three vectors there are three vectors and think about them is living in this room there in three dimensional space. They just all happened to lie in the plane of the Blackboard.  Those three vectors cannot be used to construct.  The vector sticking out of the board as a linear combination.  So just cuz you have three vectors doesn't mean that they spend three dimensional space.  So the question is do those three vectors fan three dimensional space and to answer that question.  We need to take the Matrix.  I need to take that Matrix and append to it this unknown Vector B.  to form that  Augmented system with an unknown be on that side and then we need to carry it to reduced row Echelon form or at least two row Echelon form. Now. That sounds like a pain. It's kind of like the questions you've been doing on your homework or you have an h and a K in some places there unknown Constance you need to answer is the system consistent for all values of H, or are there particular ones for which it's not so we could do that here call the coefficients of BH K&L and go through the arithmetic going to be painful but not impossible. But the thing the important thing to realize is  when I do this  When I do this when I do row operations on this Matrix, they're going to be exactly the same row operations. We used on this one over here.  Hey, so we do row operations and the purpose of the row operations is to convert the coefficient Matrix to its reduced row Echelon form.  So whatever operations we chose to do that those were determined by the coefficient Matrix. The augmented Matrix. The augmented column comes along for the ride and gets converted into whatever is going to be on the right hand side. But if I change the column on the right, it's not going to change what row operations I do to the Matrix on the left. So what that means, is that once I've done  The row operations to convert The Matrix a to reduced row Echelon form no matter what column B I have on the right. I'm going to get the same reduced row Echelon form.  On the left and I told you that for that Matrix it was this one now. I'm not going to get be anymore. It's going to be some new Vector over here.  But the question is whatever that Vector B is.  Do I actually have a solution to this system? No matter what is on the right hand side. And the answer in this case is yes, because no matter what is on the right hand side there. I've already solved 4 x 4 x 1 x 2 and x 3 here. This is x 3 equals the bottom thing X tweek was the middle thing in x 24 the top.  Okay, so  The answer to the question. Can I sell vehicles x equals B for every B?  Is a question about a alone?  Okay, and it's a question that can be answered just by looking at a if I doing row operations on a sew in this in this case the answer is yes.  It doesn't matter. What better I put there be the answer for what the solution X1 X2 X3 looks like depends on B, but the question of whether or not I can solve it only depends on it.  So is every vector be in the span?  of The Columns of a  and the answer that question depends only on The Matrix I so in this case if what I told you was right and the registration form is that identity Matrix with one's on the diagonals are as everywhere else. The answer is yes, but if I had a zero down here if it had been zero here and maybe some nuns are things above it. Then the answer would be no there would be some vectors be I could put their so that I would get, you know a0005 over there so that the last column would be pivotal. So it's just a question of the reduced row Echelon form of a whether you can solve The Matrix equation ax equals B for every be so I'll just finish with this theorem.  from your textbook  so this is a restatement of what was just said suppose I give you a matrix a  and I want to ask the question. Can I solve x equals B for every single be for anybody? I choose I can always solve ax equals B and that is equivalent to what by definition is equivalent to every be being a linear combination of The Columns of a or alternatively just from definition is it it's saying that the columns of a span all of RM?  And the way you check if that's true is to look at just the coefficient Matrix a and ask if it has a pivot in each and every row. Hey, that's what we said on this last night here. If you had a zero in the last row here, then you're going to find some bees for which this thing has an inconsistent equation. But if you have a pivot in every single row, then you will be able to solve it no matter what the stars are on the right hand side.  Okay will continue with that discussion on can you eat San Diego?
