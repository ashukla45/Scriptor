And so we're not going to ask for it on the exam.  So it's a great question would be fun to do but probably we have more urgent things to talk about today. How's that? Okay fair enough? Okay. Yes.  Part B  okay, so this is  play exam labeled version C which is number 2 on the link as I and  so you're given C.  Is V1 V2 V3?  and you want to show  it's a basis.  4 V  Okay. Now the setup is that this is a part B.  A4  The setup is that you're told.  that  there's a basis U1 U2.  You three?  What's a basis for V?  And you're also told I'll go over here.  That does a coordinate vectors of V1.  And V2 with respect to this basis.  rnr3  can I put in what they are just  For a due-diligence here.  All right now.  I'm going to ask you a question.  What can you conclude from the vector to 1-1 being the B coordinate Vector for v2?  What does that tell you?  Pressure kept asking questions like this doesn't he?  I'm sure it dies.  To tell you something about V2, right?  forgot Thunder  as you get maybe I should tell you I underline my vectors.  Okay, if it's underlined, I'm telling you it's a vector.  Lot of people write an arrow on top of it, right?  But my question remains yes.  That's got to be a minus. Well write it this way.  okay, and then these guys the coefficients of this linear combination are the components of the coordinate Vector x o  that's what the coordinate Vector tells you. Okay, and and now in part a  the idea is that you make a matrix with these is the columns.  and then  viewed as the edges of a parallelepiped with a Vertex at the origin.  these  determine that parallelepiped these call him back. And then the determinant.  an absolute value  gives you the volume.  of that parallelepiped  What y'all?  Abbreviate like that.  Okay, so that's what you did in part.  And what was that determinant? Cuz you're asking about Part B right before 4.  can important point about thats not zero and so  In Part B. Then you can what what does it tell you that the determinants? Not zero?  queso  determinant  Hey, not zero.  implies  a is invertible  Okay, not now course. Maybe you should make sure what what do I need to verify about V1 V2 V3 to know it's a basis.  Caitlin Delaney pendant and  Spam now do I have do I have any extra information that makes my task easier?  Well, I mean it this time I'm going to get that there.  If a is invertible its callings are linearly independent, right? Okay, so.  the coordinate vectors  Are linearly independent?  linearly independent  Hey, what's the dimension of V?  three, so if I have three linearly independent  Vectors what I know about him.  They span R3.  Okay, it's actually it did there a basis right? There's there's a there's a theorem in your book called The basis there and it says that if you have an n-dimensional Vector space.  Then n linearly independent vectors must be a basis.  It's also true that n vectors that span v r basis.  I got so these are linearly independent. So  They are.  ra  basis  for our threat because our three is a three dimensional space and I have three linearly independent vectors in R3  But I want a basis for V.  right  Does this tell me that V1 V2 V3 are basis for V?  Was that the question by the way, was that was that the obstacle okay.  I'll does it.  What?  But B is not a subset of RV could be polynomials, right?  We will say anything about V except that I know there are three vectors U1 U2, u3 the form basis for it. So I do know that these three dimensional.  I know that much.  Okay, so  you heard of the corner coordinate mapping, right?  right  Okay, I mean in my class if I say you heard of the coordinate mapping right when I see blank stares. That means yes.  Who hasn't?  Okay, alright the corner and now you have seen it cuz we're looking at it here.  It's going to be a mapping from V2 R3.  That sends a vector v.  To it's a b coordinate vector.  Okay, and the the point about this this is that this is a one-to-one onto correspondence and it's a linear transformation. So it's called an isomorphism.  one to one  onto  linear transformation  and these three things together or what's called then a vector space isomorphous. Now. This is all fancy terminology were not asking really for that. Alright, but the point is that saying that the coordinate vectors are a basis for R3 is the same now as staying with V1 V2 and V3 or basis for V, because because of this correspondence  Okay.  so thus  V1 V2  B3 which or you can just call it C form a basis for V.  since I put it parenthetically because  coordinate mapping  I got to call a cord map is isomorphism.  Canada where is everything that  This correspondence carries across linear Independence, if the coordinate vectors are linearly independent R3 than the original vectors V1 V2 V3 or linearly independent and so on. Okay, and it's enough for you to just mention. Oh, this is the same think that's what Professor chem proton Piazza. It's the same. Okay, if you know, the coordinate vectors are linearly independent R3, then you know, if he won V2 V3 or linearly independent and be because of this coordinate mapping correspondence.  Yes.  That's right. Yeah now, you know true skeptic would say prove it gay, but our time is short.  Okay, but that's but but you could it's not really that hard, but but I hope you'll agree that we'd probably don't want to get into that right now.  But that's right. That's exact comment is spot on.  other questions  Is that clear this up?  Okay, so good. That's so we hit the the issue was you you had no trouble seeing the coordinate vectors were a basis for R3, but it's that connection via the coordinate map. That was hopefully been cleared up for you. That's that's that's why the coordinate mapping is so important and I'm going to give a plug for this. This is a finite dimensional Vector spaces, which is all we're studying. Okay are all isomorphic to RN.  And what that means for us is doesn't matter. We could have a vector space of polynomials of continuous functions or whatever. As long as I have a finite dimensional space of those then I can model it with their coordinate vectors.  And do the Matrix manipulations and determinants and all those things that we can do in RN and then from what I find out can say the same things about the original Vector space.  That's so finite dimensional Vector spaces in some sense are all RN. They're all the same and that's a big deal, right it simplifies our study of vector spaces a great deal.  And of course in this course, we're just touching it. So I just wanted to say that to plant the seed and it's not an expectation that you know, everything I said is completely understood at this point. But this this this isomorphism is actually an extremely important.  other questions  Yes.  So pretty.  Three part D of that same one.  d  See, okay. Sorry, I spent five years in the Navy and part of that time was in a gas engine gas turbine engine room, right, you know, what a gas turbine is.  It's the same thing as a jet engine. It's just put in a ship to make the propeller go round. So so 3C.  Okay, so this is still version C. We're looking at 3 C and A.  Is a is a 19 by 33 Matrix?  Okay, and  and  set  a Barbie  in our 19  for which  ax equals B  Has a solution.  is  10 dimensional Subspace  of r19  Is a Subspace?  And I'll put that in parentheses. It wasn't in the problem. But the only thing it would be a Subspace time is r19 by of Dimension 10.  Okay, and then the question is?  what is  the dimension  of  the null-space of a  right symbols, right? What's the dimension of the null space?  All right.  So why is this a problem?  Get me a snack. What what theorem do you think we're going to apply here?  Any ideas yet?  Okay, so  the rank theorem  says  that the rank  Plus the nullity.  v a  Is the number of columns?  of a 10 course  usually you say a is a mic by November Matrix and then you write end November.  For the number of columns, right?  Okay, so and what's the nullity is that?  Best dimension of null-space. Okay, so we think this might so.  now  how many columns does they have?  33 Okay, so we know this is 33.  Okay, we're being asked for the military, right?  Okay, so what's the rank?  Are we think the rank is 10?  Okay now but but of course.  How do we know that right? That's that's why this was questions being asked right?  Okay, so  let me just remind you.  I'm going to I'm going to write a a  is equal to  A1  how many columns does it have?  33  So where each?  Where are the columns? What Vector space are they in?  r19  Okay. So my 19 by 33 Matrix can be thought of as a matrix with 33 columns where each column is a column in r19. All right, and that ax equals B.  has  a solution  if  and only if  I'll use the standard Double Arrow if and only if  there  Is an x equal?  X1 how many entries is X going to have if I'm going to be able to multiply it on the left by a  33, okay.  Such that.  X1 A1  Plus  up to x 33  a33  equal pay  now you know that right?  Gave matrix multiplication by axe gives you a linear combination of The Columns of a write something you've known since your linear algebra youth right?  yes, okay, so  now this is the same as saying that be  is in the span of the columns, but what's the span of The Columns of a  what do we call that?  Exactly. So, let's see the span.  are The Columns of a  I wish there are 33.  Which is also known as the column space of a right a span is always a Subspace. Okay, and then and what's what do we call the dimension of the column space?  We call it the rank, don't we?  So Dimension were told so the problem statement.  tells us that the rank is 10 because the rank is the dimension of the column space which is exactly the dimension of the set that B has to come from because be is exactly in the column space of a  every time a ax equals B has a solution.  Okay.  Dimension column space of a  is also called the rank of a  which is 10 and then of course once you know that you put 10 here.  And then what's the nullity?  What's that 23?  So the answer is that dimension of the null space?  is 23  are we doing that?  Now one thing that that I recommend you always ask is why was this hard?  Doesn't look hard now does it?  Why was it hard?  Why did we have to stop and think about it?  case of the dimension its number of linearly independent Columns of a right  Okay, so we had to make the connection between being in the possible set of the vectors of which ax equals B has a solution and being in the column space today. Was that connection? Okay. I'm going to give it this is a big piece of advice for you. Are you listening?  Okay, I think you'll find this is not just in linear algebra that whenever you come across a problem that took some effort to work out. Once you work it out. You got to go back and ask yourself. Okay. What was the problem?  Because as you do that, you're thinking will become more disciplined.  Things will start to seem easier, okay?  All right, so, you know go back and ask yourself afterwards riy. Was that hard? It's not hard now, right?  Why was a card? Okay, if you ask yourself that and spend a little time appreciating that I think it would help a lot. Okay other questions.  Version a number one.  alright, so you're  given the set of polynomials  of the grid most 3  Cav course the coefficients come from the real numbers. I won't write that.  I'm and you're given the standard basis, which is what you'd expect one t t squared 2 cubed.  So it's standard.  And then you're giving another bases called B.  Which is one OnePlus t one- t squared.  1 + 2 cubed  guess what's another basis?  And you're given a polynomial p.  Who's B coordinate vector?  Is a 1 2 3 4?  And you're asked to find.  the  standard coordinate vector  Okay.  What's up? Let me ask you this.  if I took my  What's called Q?  SAQ was  I'm going to I'm just going to give it.  I'm just thinking a little bit about note Asic use a polynomial. It's written like this, right?  What's its standard basis coordinate vector?  Okay C 0  C1 C2 C3 that's why why we like the standard basis? Okay.  brighten our  since PB is this  Okay.  Since the B coordinate Vector is one two, three four. What do we know about p?  Okay, so 1 * 1 +.  2 * what?  Okay 1 + 2 + 3 x  okay.  Plus 4 I guess there's only one left OnePlus TQ. Okay.  I so the fact that 1 2 3 4 is the B coordinate Vector means I can write pee in this form if I wrote it in standard form. Could I read off the coordinates with respect to the standard base?  Yes, right. So let's do that is so you might call at simplifying this you just write it in standard form write it like this. Okay. Now what you'll notice is that  I'm going to have 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.  As the constant term write what's 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 10, I'm going to put 10 for my constant term. Okay, and just for the bookkeeping it means I took care of that that that that guy and now  I want to write the linear term. What's the coefficient of T going to be?  To get to tea that's going to take care of this and what's the coefficient of T Square?  -3 I'm going to write -3 t squared that takes care of this.  And how about t cubed?  It's clear that so what is this a p?  the standard basis coordinate Vector going to be  tan  2  -3 for  Again, what made it hard?  Doesn't look hard now doesn't.  I hope not right but that doesn't that doesn't look hard. But what was the issue? What was the question?  Anybody have a suggestion?  I know it's it's misleading to say oh that problems trivia. It wasn't trivia when you started to think about it. Was it?  Hey, but now if I said it's trivial you might let me have it, right.  right  Okay.  So what was it? What's the difference between before and after?  nobody wants to  Okay. So the suggestion is making the connection between the coordinate Vector the basis and the actual polynomial was a point of confusion.  Excellent. Okay. So so this is an illustration of how coordinate vectors work, right?  Alright other question. Yes.  Part B  three part B  Okay.  Okay. So the setup is that a is a mic play, November Matrix.  and  and we want to determine.  the dimension of the column space today  plus the dimension of the null space.  of a transpose  Okay.  Now what?  So why is this hard?  Yeah.  Sherwood  so  Okay.  Thank you. Let me off the hook. All right, so  so why why am I being asked this?  Yeah.  Right, but what's the what's the white? Why did we ask about Part B instead of her day was easy, right?  Why is Part B harder?  Yeah.  Trent oh, yeah, there's a transpose there. That's probably okay. That's why it's harder. Okay, so we need to look at that.  Right now we rank theorem.  says that the dimension  of the row space of a  Is equal to the dimension?  of the column space of a  and the dimension of the column space of a this common Dimension is defined to be the rank of that.  Yes, you go back and look at the rank theorem says that the dimension of space and the dimensions of space coincide of pivot positions in The Matrix.  right  Okay.  and then you also have that the rank of a  plus the nullity of a  or the dimension of the null space rights the same thing.  Just another name for it.  Is equal to the number of columns?  Okay.  Okay.  And for Mike by November Matrix, that would be November, right?  Okay.  So this is what we know and now we have to deal with this transpose Okay, so  column space of a house that related to a transpose  What happens when you take a transpose of a matrix?  The Columns and rows are switch so that the columns of a transpose are the rows of a  that means that the column space of a is the row space.  of a transpose  right  And this solves the problem, doesn't it?  Because now I can rewrite.  bad  sorry for my spaghetti work on the board here that the DeMent this is equal to  this is the dimension of the column space of a plus two dimensional space of a transpose is equal to  the dimension  of the row space  of a transpose  plus the dimension  of the null space  Of a transpose that's a transpose in the only see if I can.  Make this fit a little better dimension of row space of a transpose.  plus dimension  of the null space  of a transpose  Hey, but, but that's the rank.  of a transpose  plus the nullity of a transpose, isn't it?  And that has two equal.  the number of columns  And they transpose, right?  That's what the rank theorem says. Okay. Well, what's the number of columns in a transpose?  Number Rosa de Sol. How many rows does it have?  Mike  Okay, that's the answer to 3 Part B then, isn't it?  So the connection between a and a transpose was the key here, right?  Okay other questions.  Okay, would somebody like to introduce a motion to adjourn?  Okay have a motion to adjourn have a second. Is anyone at third?  What's that?  Take the oil. I have a motion to take a book question that overrides the motion to adjourn.  Okay, I need to get my butt, right.  What you got for me?  question 22 on page 117  Okay, so  why this isn't section 2.3?  and the HX  equals c is consistent.  ci2  for some sea  And the sea is in RN.  Okay.  And then what can you say about h x equal 0?  Now the one thing you can always say about h x equals zero is its consistent, right?  Gave the always has the trivial solution now.  but  That's about all you can say, right? Because if now if it's if you interpret for some but not all  I see if it's consistent for all C.  Then in fact the trivial solution is the only solution.  Oh, let me see my aging eyes hear that.  It does say that inconsistent and consistent.  Okay, if this is inconsistent for somfy, then you know, there's going to be a non-trivial null space.  That's what you said right that that you you would do that.  it has  non-trivial Solutions  another was there something else is bothering you about this.  Let's see.  if  see if it's inconsistent.  Right, then the columns.  a h  Do not span RN.  Okay.  And and so that means that either.  H doesn't have enough columns  or the columns are dependent and in either case, there'd be non-trivial Solutions. All right, I think for this at that.  You know if we asked you why then you would want to say a little bit more and that relationship clearly you're able to characterize, okay?  All right, Do you want to go back to that motion to adjourn?  Okay, no Jackson. Alright, then we're adjourned.  UC San Diego podcast ",
