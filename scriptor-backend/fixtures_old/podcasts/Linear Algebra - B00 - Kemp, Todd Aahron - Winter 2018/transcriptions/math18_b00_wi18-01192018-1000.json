  "Full Transcript": "Do I listen to a podcast?  Alright, so let's get started.  Today we are going to be continuing with our finishing what we started last day with the Matrix equation ax equals B.  And moving on to section 1.5 a sort of more complete is selling what theoretical description of solution sets of linear systems of equations.  And next time on Monday. We will move onto linear Independence. Okay?  Your reminders that you have MyMathLab homework number one and number two. They're both do this coming Monday. So that the next day of class Monday after this weekend due by 11:59 p.m. Please make sure to get those in by then and you have not lab homework number one, which is due tonight by 11:59 p.m. Submitted to gradescope. Those of you who have already been admitted to the class already got an email long ago about being registered in the gradescope course for not allowed for this course until you have instructions on how to do that. If you haven't done so already if you were still on the wait list and have now been admitted then you will get an e-mail sometime today or possibly later on on the weekend in which case will extend the deadline for you. Don't worry to upload those two gradescope comment about the  Size of the room dusty over in the back. There are three. I see three or four seats down here would be good. If you come and sit in the seats at C5 seats down here. I think that there are enough seats for everybody cuz regularly coming it's better that you don't stay at the back because it is theoretically possible that the fire marshal could come in and do a spot check. Now that happens in principle. They could shut down the building what would likely happen if they would ask you to leave the room? So if there is a seat you should sit in it, which means that please please please get here early so that you're not coming and sitting in the seats while people are already sitting on and you're interrupting class, but please sit in the seats if there are seats available.  Alright, so let us proceed.  with today's lecture  So I'm going to start with where we finished last day, which is the serum that we demonstrated through several examples and discuss why it's true and we'll see more examples right now to understand this better volume at the Matrix equation ax equals be for some Matrix a some vector be where the vector B has the same height as the Matrix a the same number of rows. Okay, and that's the condition for the for that to be possible to ask about whether it's solvable because remember that a x x is really a shorthand for use the coefficients in X to make a linear combination of The Columns of a and so for that linear combination of The Columns of eggs equal BB has to live in the same space. So if those columns are Heights 710b have to have height 7, so we're interested in The Matrix equation x equals B, and if we have a particular be so if you have a matrix AI give you and feel of a particular be then the way to answer the question.  Solve ax equals B is to write down the augmented Matrix a dotted lines B. And now you have that linear system eukaryote to row Echelon form or reduced row Echelon form. If you want to know what the solution is and you solve the system, but the more general question is okay. I give you a matrix a but I'm interested in the following question. Is it true that I can solve the system ax equals B for any be I'm going to get different solutions for different bees, but can I do it no matter what be I put there.  Sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not and what is the exact condition for that? So again to be led the first three are just restatements using all the new language was developed in this week of that statement. So here are four logically equivalent statements. Any one of these statements is true exactly when all of the others are so the question is 10x equal to be be solved for any be can we find an ax given anybody can we find an exit solve x equals be by definition as we said by definition of matrix multiplication that's equivalent to the statement for any Vector B. Vector B is a linear combination of The Columns of a that's what x equals B says.  And similarly just using the word Stan what you all need to get accustomed to. I heard from the section instructors that you were talking about Spanish yesterday and it's something that you didn't appear to be comfortable with that which isn't surprising because it's a new world. It's a New Concept. It's a little bit more abstract than things we've seen before which is why you need to spend extra time to studying and reading and doing examples understand it better. But believe me you're going to understand it really well by the end of next week for example, a thousand more examples with it anymore. So just another restatement of party is that The Columns of a span are and that's exactly what Spanish is the span of the columns is the set of linear combinations of those columns and to say that they span RMS to say that every Vector beaten RM is a linear combination of those columns.  And then finally the key Point here, which is how we actually answer. The question is what you do is you take just a you forget there is no BM Envy is not a sad thing if you're going to have to answer for all be so you just take a and you reduce it to row Echelon form and you check to see where the pivots are if there's a pivot in every row of a that is if there's no rows of zeros in a in the row Echelon form of a then yes, you can solve x equals B for every beat if there's a row of zeros or more than one row of zeros in the road and I in any row Echelon form of a then know there will be some vectors be you can't find in the span of The Columns of a  Okay, so let's let's cement that with another example all the times we did last day had an affirmative answer to these four properties that x equals me was always solvable for everybody. So let's do an example wild guess I'm giving away the answer here, but let's do an example which will see right away gives away the answer where that's not the case. So here's a matrix.  So we could have this is not an augmented Matrix is the augmented part of the Matrix is just you keeping track of what color means what for you and it's given situation The Matrix is just the Matrix but we're thinking of this as the coefficient Matrix of some system. So if we were going to solve a particular system x equals B, you have another column B on the right hand side. So we have our coefficient Matrix up there and we want to answer the question Do The Columns of that Matrix spend all of our three the first of all we need to make sure that that even make sense.  So the columns are a height 3. So that means that they're span that is the set of linear combinations. Those columns is a collection of vectors in R3. So at least make sense to ask this question. So what we're asking is 10 ax equals B be solved for any Vector bnr34 every single vector and Arthur I'm gives us a condition for that. We just need to see if every column a story of every row in a is pivotal. So I've gone ahead and use Matlab to find the reduced row Echelon form of a it's written right here.  Can you see that there are some fractions there and I want to make sure you're not worried when you see fractions most examples I do in class and they have been cooked up on your homework. They're cooked up so that you only end up doing just to make things easier but by and large if I put a random Matrix down there and do raw operations. I'm going to get fractions, by the way. I actually study random matrices. That's my area of research and when you're doing random Matrix Theory, you never have integers that you always have infinite decimal points almost always but I'm not going to be doing random matrices here. We're doing cook that particular matrices that work out nicely so that you're not wasting your time doing awful arithmetic instead of understanding the concept but we do have to be prepared to see some fractions. So in this case if you do the row row reduction and we'll do a little bit of it in a moment. You'll see that you have 2/3 at some point and get some of the numbers there will not be integers. But anyways, that's not what matters what matters is.  We can now answer the question from the theorem that they're on the last page said.  That you can solve ax equals B for any given be precisely when precisely when a has a pivot.  and each and every row  so  does a have a pivot in each and every row here?  You know that my phone actually isn't working.  Okay. Yes. That is correct. A does not have a pivot in every Row. The last row has no pivot.  Hello.  LOL, okay. I'm sorry.  So some of  some of this lecture unfortunately will be Visual and not audible. Let's continue.  So the last row of a is not pivotal here or at that is to say the last row of the registration form of a does not have a pivot. It doesn't have a leading entry all zeros there for the theorem tells us that they're 4X equals B is not always solvable there must be some bees doesn't mean that you can never solve ax equals B, but you can certainly solve ax equals be for some be example. Remember the theorem says the definition of matrix multiplication says Solving x equals B is saying that b is in the linear is a linear combination of The Columns of a  So for example, if I were to put the First Column of a 3-3 6 let's call that be then I know I can solve ax equals be for that be because that b is a linear combination The Columns of a it's a linear combination where I use One X the First Column plus there are tons of second-place are * 1/3 + 0 * 4th. So there will always be some vectors you can put their that are solutions that for which there are solutions to ax equals B, but because there is a row of zeros at the bottom here because not every row is pivotal. There will also be some be for what you can't stop it.  So let's look at a specific example.  Let's ask the question. Can I solve ax equals B where B is the vector 001  What do you think just looking at at what's on the board here? I'm going to give you 10 seconds to talk to your neighbor and we'll answer the question yes, or no with a vote.  All right, let's do that boat. Now how many people think that ax equals 001 has a solution.  None of you how many people think that it does not have a solution.  Okay, so that's majority voted and said that it doesn't have a solution would someone like to explain why they came to that conclusion?  Yes.  Okay, so if you put that zero zero one next to the Matrix above it there make that augmented Matrix. Then there would be the last, would be pivotal and you would have an equation 0 equals 1 meaning no solution. That's your that's probably the reason you all use right.  Okay, the answer you came to was correct, but for the totally wrong reason.  Because you can't put that column next to the reduced row Echelon form of it. The question was not does this Matrix hear the registration form of call that Matrix a poodle.  The Matrix at the top is a and this Matrix here, oops is a twiddle it's a different matrix. It's row equivalent, but that doesn't mean that solving a twiddle ax equals B is the same as solving ax equals B.  We got from a to a twiddle by row operations.  Okay, so if I had a b a pendant to a and I wanted to solve that I do row operations when I do the operations they affect be as well.  So what I have to do.  They have to start again with the be attended to a Duro operations on the whole thing and see if I get see if I get a pivot in the last column or not.  Now the reason that you stopped making that stuff a mistake, which I knew I was hoping you it all makes it. Thank you very much cuz it's I wanted to make sure to demonstrate that that's a common mistake. You need to avoid. The reason that you thought that it was once you made that mistake that this answer the question is how you leave a one down there at the bottom and all zeros everywhere else that says it's an inconsistent system. No, here's here's the thing though. It's almost right. That reasoning is almost right. See when I append. Is there is there a one down there and I start doing real operations.  Because there's zero is there.  The row operations where you pivot scaling Roll by something or add a multiple of one world to another they're not going to affect the zeros there. So it almost seems like they'll be no problem. Really. We will just have a 0-0 one there. Why is that not always true?  Can someone explain to me? Why why it could go wrong?  Maybe I'm lying to you and it and it can't go wrong.  Okay, you're right that if I had given you a different Vector like two three one, then their operations would affect it. But what I'm asking is given this Vector here if I do these I'm going to we're going to do operations in a second. If I if I do operations to carry this augmented Matrix at the bottom here to row Echelon form.  The two row operations. I just mentioned are not going to affect those zeros. So it seems like we will always have zero zero one staying there from beginning to end. Why is that not true? What's the subtlety I missing here. Yes.  Exactly. There's one more kind of row operation swapping to Rose and that could move the one somewhere else and you might end up with a zero at the bottom and there be no contradiction. So we have to go through the operations to see if we actually needed a row swap here or not to get to the register at 1 to a row Echelon form. So you can't just answer the problem by looking to see if that one is in there. Not you actually have to do the operation. So let's just for practice. Let's do a few of them anyway.  Okay. So what we're going to do if we want to get the zero in the second row below the first in and First Column, so we do that by I'm not going to write with your operations were using now you should be expert enough to reconstructed after work, but I'll say it out loud. We're going to add the first row to the second.  That gives our two sides are there gives us a three here zero here three there and of courses are there.  Okay, and now we're also going to get a zero in the  last row in the First Column by subtracting twice the first row from that one giving us our desired 0ther have to subtract twice 5 from one giving me a -9 I have to subtract twice -4 from -8, but that means adding a 2-8 giving me a zero and I have to subtract 1 from -79  and the zero that means I'm not doing anything to this one.  Okay. Now the next thing that I would do I suppose is Pivot.  So I would divide the first row and the second row by 3, which is by the way why we're going to get that fractions with a 3 in the bottom. But let's let's not do that. Let's just try to get see what happened how we get those zeros in the bottom row. We know we're going to get zeros in the a part. But I told you that Matlab told us that and you can now see why because ignoring the last column the second row in the third row are multiples of each other. The third row is -3 times the second row at this stage of the row reduction. So if I know and I'll write this one just to be clear if I know multiply the second row by -3 and add it to the third row and put the result in the third row.  That actually kills the third row.  You're right. Thank you.  But it doesn't kill the one cuz I've adding is 3 x 0 to 1 and I get the one there so we can stop there. We're not in what we are in a row Echelon form. But now this thing is in a row Echelon form and now we can see. Oh, yeah, it is problematic. It is inconsistent. We did not need to do any row swaps in order to get here until your original intuition turned out to work in this case, but you have to be careful cuz it might have been the case if there was a real swell.  Okay, so the illustrator again this year I'm going to go back again. The therapist says that ax equals B can be solved for every be if and only if he has a pivot in every Row the why is that true? So we saw here in this example that forgetting about rose quartz for the moment. It's because if I don't have a pivot in every row that means the farmers going to have a row of zeros, which means I could take a vector like zero zero one independent there and I'm going to get an inconsistency the caution is that that argument doesn't quite work because of the possibility of necessary row swaps, but if in this example, we had needed a row Swap and that one had ended up in the second row instead of the 3rd, then it just means we should have started with the vectors 0 1 0 and then that roast while we needed would have put the one down below where we needed it. So you see this theorem is true because we can always use one of the vectors 0 0 1 or 0 1 0 or  1001 of the vectors with a 1 in one place and is there is everywhere else appendix hurt at the end of the row reduction and work backwards and we'll find some Vector that is some Vector B for which ax equals B caapi sauce.  This is a really important point.  The number of pivotal Rose tells us how many will use this language next week how many linearly independent? Kahlo's there are it tells us really how much information is there any equations there were three equations represented by a butt because of that Rose there is at the bottom really only two of them contain independent formation. And the third is just a copy of that same information from the which means we can't possibly expect to solve it is to constraints that we can't possibly expect to solve it for every Vector in three dimensional space where there's three constraints.  And so that's the key here. We need to look to see the row Echelon form and see whether or not there's a row of zeros. If there is then there must be some bees for which we can't solve the system.  All right. So that was a section on Matrix equations. Now moving onto solution sets of linear system. Actually nothing new here. Well at the end of stayed up there, I'm a theoretical Theron which summarizes some of the calculations that we've done it in a way that that can be useful in some some examples, but not really for computational reasons. But before we embarked on this description of solution sets, I want to review basically done in the first for lectures. Hey, we started this course talking about linear systems of equations with quickly use some new notation and said, let's just get rid of the exes were doing the computations and we write this augmented Matrix into row operations is a different representation of the same idea. And then in the last two lectures, we said Ellis look at 2.  Sounds like different problems, but turn out to be the same thing doctor equations in Matrix equations. Okay, and then we saw that all four of those are different representations of the same thing solving linear systems of equations. So I want to remind us of how that works here. But at the same time, I want up now start to use some new language every pretty much every lecture. We're going to learn some new where you going to have to unmake sure you learn and understand those words. So I want to talk about two different kinds of linear systems now,  and it's all about what the be on the right hand side is  so the nicest cases when the be on the right hand side is all zeros.  Do we call such a system homogeneous system of equations is a system where if we read it as a matrix equation has the form ax equals 0 for the be on the right hand side is zero a that's a homogeneous system of equation. And if it's not homogeneous, we call it in homo genius will look at examples of that on the next five, but just to cement this so here here's an example of a homogeneous system of equations for x 1 + 5 x 2 - 4 x 3 equals 0 - 3 x 1 - 2 x 2 + 4 x 3 equals 0 what makes it homogeneous is just the fact that this is the stuff on the right hand side is 0  So this is a system of two equations in three unknowns at the homogeneous system of two equations.  No, just to remind us of all the different ways we could represent this. So we saw yesterday or last day Wednesday. My three-year-old daughter uses the term yesterday to mean anything in the past. So I may use it that way as well as apologize if it's confusing and tomorrow means anything in the future as well. So your final is tomorrow anybody panicking or was everyone actually laughing you could find was not actually tomorrow? Okay, so last lecture we talked about Matrix equations, and we saw that this system of equations can be written as the following Matrix equation. We write the coefficient Matrix, which is just given by the coefficients in front.  of the variables  x x 1 x 2 x 3 is equal to 0 0 this system of equations is equivalent to that Matrix equation.  On the other hand, we saw the day before that also yesterday that this system of equations can be written as a vector equation where we take the columns corresponding to the X1 X2 an extra variables and write them is separated vectors.  X those X coefficients  and then finally at the very beginning we said, you know, if we're going to solve that system. Let's just discard the X notation from the start to save ourselves writing and just write the augmented Matrix which we will then do row operations on.  Anta I like that. Add line but your textbook doesn't and that is the augmented Matrix representing that system so all four of these are just different notation for the exact same thing the system of equations  This system of equations and what makes it homogeneous. Is that its zeros all zeros on the right hand side of the equation. So that's a homogeneous system in those are all of the ways we can represent one.  So let's look at some examples.  Why do we have this funny word? Why are we adding a new word? If we just I mean I can tell you let's call a system hunky-dory if the numbers on the right hand side or 1 and 7. That would be a very silly new word to force you to learn.  Okay, because it doesn't have anything special about it. But there is something special about having only zeros on the right hand side. What special is this? Usually for any system. There's a trichotomy of things that can happen with the solution set the solutions that could be empty. No Solutions. It could have exactly one solution or could have infinitely many solutions. And the thing that's special about media systems is that they can't have that first possibility. They always have at least one solution because it's a dichotomy and trichotomy and the reason is that you can always solve a homogeneous system by setting all the variables equal to zero.  Let's go actually back to this life.  If I set X1 X2 and X3 equal to 0 then automatically I get 0 for each of those equations.  Okay, just buy the form of the equation. That's what's great about homogeneous system. You can always say yeah, I know there's going to be a solution 0 is a solution may not be the only one so you can have one solution zero or you can have infinitely many solutions, but you can never be in that unfortunate situation where there's no Solutions.  Okay. So let's look at two examples here and will give us a new language for describing those solution sets of homogeneous systems were going to do the same thing. We've been doing for the last 4 lectures your new row reduction to solve these systems by converting them to reduced row Echelon form. These are small enough that it's just going to take two or three steps so we can do them really quickly here.  So with this first one here, I'm going to add the first row to the second.  that gives me  that's by the way, we actually already did this. I've just taken the first two rows of this Matrix so we can just repeat exactly the same operations we did there so I could just copy and paste on over but may as well do it again.  3 5-4  00 and now I'm going to Pivot so I'm going to  Divide the last row by 3.  And I'm almost in row Echelon form.  I'm if I die, I'm in row Echelon form but to fully solve the system. I want to be in reduced row Echelon form. So I'm going to add -5 of the second row to the first row that still has the three up there and that's going to give the desired zero here and actually doesn't affect the -4 cuz there's a zero down there.  Answer the last thing we have to do is divide that first row by 3 to get it to reduced row Echelon form. So I will eating one there and there you see that - 4/3  So there must have made a mistake, but I don't think we did there is the reduced row Echelon form of this augmented Matrix so we know what to do. Now if I want to describe the solution set. So the first of all I have a unique solution.  Shut up the answer. Is there a unique solution?  No is another unique solution because there's a free variable. This column here doesn't have a pivot in it doesn't have a leading one in it, which means that it corresponds to a free variable x 3 is a free variable which means that our solution set is not going to be just a single point. It's going to be described as X1 and X2 functions of x3. So if I write the system of equations that I get from there, they now the reduced equations 2x 1 - 4/3 x 3 equals 0 and x 2  equals 0  Okay, so X2 is pin down but X1 is only determined by X3. So in other words I write that the solution set looks like X1 X2 X3 equals.  4/3 x 3  0 + x 3 and that's the best I can say now. I'm just going to give you some new notation here, which is to say we want to describe this in parametric form and all that means is we're going to rename the the free variables in this case is won a free variable. We're going to rename it something new. Let's call it s so this seems like a silly step right now, but in other words, this just says x 1 is equal to 4/3 sx2 is equal to 0 + x 3 is equal to pass.  Okay, and what why have I done that? Let me do one more step here and I'm going to factor out that ass and I can write this is s * 4/3 0.  and one  so the says that the solution looks like s x 4/3 0 14 n e s s is this free variable s is this parameter? So what it tells me is that I can set a ski with anything I want and I'll get a solution of this system. I have a 1 parameter family of solutions.  And if you think about this a little bit what it's saying is I have this Vector for 3rd 01.  and the solution set looks like all together multiples of that Vector, which is the same thing as saying  The solution set is the span of that one vector or thirds 01.  That's what it solutions that looks like in this case. It's the span of a single Vector which means the lines for that doctor all points on the line through that Vector are solutions. Okay, by the way, it's not a unique Vector that works there instead of a sequel to three and I would have had the vector 4:03 and I could use that veteran say hey, this is the span of a vector vector is not that unique critical thing. It's the spanning set. That is the solution set. Is this line which you could say is this  Cuz that's what we call a parametric solution. We describe the solution as a set of points that are in the span of some vectors are that are equal to some parameter x a vector or it could be more complicated. Let's look at the second example of an augmented Matrix corresponding to a system of two equations in 4 unknowns a homogeneous system cuz they're zeros on the right hand side.  So let's do our row operations. Okay. What what should I do? What first row operation should I do?  Yeah, I can subtract the second row the first row from the second. But you know what I'm going to do something different just to just to have a little fun here. This is not really what I do for fun, but I still think it's fun. I'm actually going to swap Row 1 and Row 2. I'm allowed to do that.  And the reason I did that is now if I subtract Row 1 from Row 2 to get my desired 0 down there.  Then this is zero that I have up here and it means there's just a little less arithmetic.  And actually this Matrix is now already in reduced row Echelon form. If I had done the algorithm straightforward and said let's subtract the first row from the second and proceed it would have required one more step of row reduction. Sometimes it can be good to be clever and do some some swaps or something else for us to reduce your your workload. Does this Matrix is down reduced row Echelon form, which means that I can solve it. So let's solve at the way. We've been solving and say look this is does not have a unique solution because there are free variables how many free variables here?  Two free variables. Okay this one and this one.  Different color to the second one. Those are free variables. So X3 and X4 going to be free variables. So we would have described the solution before Willis write the equations. They're just equation x 1 + x 3 + 2 x 4 equals 0 and x 2  + x 3 - x 4 - 3 x 4 equals 0 so that means that I would write the solution set as  X1 X2 X3 X4  I would write it in terms X1 X2 X3 and X4 next to in terms of x3 and X4 the free variable but let me go right away and rename x 3 is equal to a sin x 4 is equal to T. I just give new names phonetically letters like r s t u v that's going to letters for the parameters here. And so if I take those equations I can say I will X1 is going to be able to - x 3 - 2x for which I renamed - x - 2 t  X2 is equal to - x 3 + 3 x 4 which is - s + 3T.  X3 is equal to SX4 is equal to a description of the parametric solution here. Let me go one more step here.  And write this in a nice way, which is to pull out everything that has an s in it pull up everything that has a t in it and write it as two separate column vectors. So that's equal to S. * -1 - 110 + 80 x - 2 3 0 1  Okay, it's can be tricky the first time you see this you're going backwards. Usually you would combine them together. But here we're going backwards everything. You see with an S. You separated. Everything is for the TU step right up. And the reason I wrote it this way is that now we see what is the solution set in consists of all vectors that are some scalar multiple of that for Spectre - 1 - 110 + some scalar multiple that second Vector - 2301 where the scalar multiple S&T can be anything we want.  In other words by definition the parametric solution here says that the solution set is equal to the span of the two vectors. -1 - 110 - 2301  So this should really help you understand. What's fan me that's what spam means stand means. So it's a set of skills are multiples of some factors. But this is where it comes up or one place of comes up is in the solution set of a homogeneous system of equations. I pay you get free variables in this free variable so you can set them equal to whatever you want and you have to that determines the other variables values, but if you actually write it out like this what the X1 X2 X3 and X4 equal to its going to equal a span of some vectors the set of all possible linear combinations of some vectors. The number of vectors is going to equal the number of three variables. So the number three variables determines how big the solution set is how many parameters that has  The both of these examples you have the solution set is incident, but the second one is sort of a bigger than the set than the first not not an accounting sense the same infinite size, but they are geometrically different. The first one is a line. The second one is a plane which is bigger a geometrically than a line.  So that's the whole story on homogeneous systems and it was critical here that we had zeros on the right hand side of zeros on the right hand side for a homogeneous system. You're going to get a parametric solution like this, which means you're going to get the solution set is the span of some collection of vectors.  that's not quite what happens for an in homogeneous system and an homogeneous system is one that is not homogeneous okay  is it actually reminds me I should have mentioned at the beginning that there's a famous quote from Android to Addy who was the mathematician it from France passed away only about 10 years ago I famous for being one of those may be able to prove the properties of the mandelbrot set if you're part of the mandelbrot set should look it up it's a fun thing but then I'mma call systems which is the study of nonlinear systems we're doing linear systems here and that's the study of nonlinear systems largely and his famous quote is that dividing the world into linear vs. nonlinear is like dividing the world into bananas versus non bananas because almost everything in the world is nonlinear which is true but at the same time that it isn't quite accurate because everything we talked about in the world can be in some nice way approximated by linear systems where most of things I care about cannot be well approximated by bananas  Maybe for you, it's different. But for me, that's the case. Anyway, here's another distinction between homogeneous and non-homogeneous in how much is most systems are in homogeneous. You write down random number. They're they're almost never going to be zero, but it turns out that the difference is something we can understand. It's not so so subtle. It's just just one extra step here. So let's demonstrate what happens with an in homogeneous system here. This is the same coefficient Matrix. We did on the last slide that won the second example there there. We were solving a system with some Matrix ax equals 0 and now we're doing that same Matrix ax equals not zero, but the Spectre b equals 434, 3  So let's carry this to reduced row Echelon form to find the solution set.  I'm going to do the same trick. I did last time and swap. The two rows to save myself one step of row reduction to get to the reduced row Echelon form.  Okay, I know we do the same thing as before we subtract the first row from the second that gives us the zero there doesn't affect that one cuz of the zero there gives us a one there in a -3 there. And now the important thing is what happens to the spinal column. We have to know pay attention. We don't have zeros there. So it those entries will be affected by the row operations and that gives us a one here.  Okay, I know this is dumb is in reduced row Echelon form before so let's write out the solution sets as before. We have the two three variables x 3. I'll call that one SX4. I'll call that won t and so I'm just going to pick off from there. Just following exactly the same thing. We did before X1 X2 X3 and X4. So that first row of the reduced Matrix. It says X1 + S + 2 T equals 3.  okay, so that means that subtracting I'm going to get X1 is equal to - s - 2T + 3  the second row says X2 + S - 3 T equals 1 which is the same as X2 is equal to - s + 3T + 1 and then just like before by definition. We have x 3 is equal to ask next fourth equals a t  Now, let me write that out. Like I did before I hear this is this is a perfectly good Final Answer here is the parametric solution of this system. Every solution looks like this you choose your free variables asking teachers are very severe ever. They want they could both be zero, they could be one and seven. They could be pie and see whatever real numbers you want. You got a solution.  But let's ride in that nicer form.  Where we separate out the asses and the t's so this is s x just like before - 1 - 110 + 60 x - 2301 but now there's some extra junk the extra junk is I haven't accounted yet for the three in the one that showed up there that don't have an answer at 2 in front of them. That's what in homogeneous systems do if there's an a third piece to the puzzle.  which is  and this case. Factor that  Okay, so compare this to what we had down here.  The difference is just that third piece of the puzzle. So this was the system we solved.  This is a typo here this there was supposed to be a 0-0 here. So this is the system. We solved on the previous Slide the homogeneous system and we found that the parametric solution look like the linear anything in the linear, that is a linear combination of these two vectors. Anything was fan of those two vectors for the corresponding in homogeneous system here with the same coefficient Matrix, but a non-zero be on the right hand side. We got that the solution set looks like  Something in the span of those two vectors same two vectors same parametric solution exactly plus another piece and nonzero thing.  In other words down here. We had a plane the plane say say these two vectors represent that playing OK it's a plane but what's critical here is that it's a plane passing through the origin 0 is a solution a homogeneous system is always have 0 is a solution if the origin is my throat here in my torso here than this plane passing through the origin now, what's the solution set of discourse funding in in homogeneous system. It's that plane. It's a plane that is not passing through the origin the origin stays fixed in space and that's not always in my throat. It's a translation of that planes. It's a parallel plane but moved  Moved away from the origin in the direction of this Vector 3100 and that's the general situation here.  That if you solve the homogeneous system than any solution of any in homogeneous system with the same coefficient. Matrix is going to look like that same parametric solution shift translated by some particular. This is called a particular solution.  Okay this last part here. So we have some particular solution and we use it to translate the homogeneous solution that gives us an in homogeneous solution. Be careful particular solution sounds like it's probably the unique thing but that's not true at all. I could have thought to find out what the particular solution is here. I said S&T with a zero.  But I could just as well have set a sequel to Juan and t equal to zero may be. Okay, and that would give me another particular solution. If I did that then I would have to take well, that would give me the vector -1 - 110 + 310 is that would give me the vector 2 0 1 0  okay, so you could just as well write this as  now I have to use a different letter. Let me call it our  - 1 1 - 1 - 1 1 0 plus another letter. Let's call it u x - 2301 plus that different particular factor, which was what I get. When I add the first one to the third one 1010. This is a different particular solution.  So what we get is it's the same spanning vectors over there for the homogeneous case. I'm using different parameters that vet parameter are that's as -1 not priming. Are you that actually turned out to be the same as but it doesn't matter cuz I can set them equal to whatever I want. I just renamed them something different. So I get the same spanning set the same plane but translated by a different Vector, but all that means is that instead of translating up here. I'm translating over here and I get the same place. They say you should think about that geometrically in their problems on the homework that have you thinking about that but I don't want to make you is that there isn't a single particular solution.  There will be some in homogeneous solution lots of them and then you take the homogeneous solution and translated by any one of those and you get the full in homogeneous solution question.  Always Solutions are equal.  Depends what you mean. So yes, it is our only solution of parallel. So if you mean all possible ways of writing down the solution of x equals be for a particular be there all the same. It's just the solution set for that particular be but you could write it in different ways. That's all we've done here in this last moment. But if the question was a bigger question all the different solution sets for all the systems ax equals beware be various and the answer is yes, all those solution sets will be parallel planes or lines are parallel three dimensional spaces and 17 dimensional space or some like that. They're still two more minutes 3 more minutes of the lecture. So, please don't put your books away yet.  Okay, so that's pretty much the whole story here. But there's one more caveat. There's one more subtlety that I wanted to be clear on. Okay, which is  you can't always expect there to be a solution for it in homogeneous system. Even if there is for the homogeneous one, we know there always is for the homogeneous one any homogeneous system has zero as a solution might have others or might have zero is a unique solution. Okay, but that doesn't mean just cuz there's a solution for the homogeneous one. That doesn't mean there's a solution for an in homogeneous one with the same coefficient Matrix. So here is an example here is a 3 by 3 system and it's a homogeneous system. So we know that it has a solution 0 is a solution of this system. But if we want to characterize the full solution set then we have to do row reduction on the homogeneous augmented Matrix. So I'm not allowed to do that for us here. Actually. We already did it the beginning of lecture. This is this this is a version of the same system. We did at the beginning and there's the reduced row Echelon form and we see in this case. We have a row.  Zero's at the bottom now from the beginning of the lecture. We know that means that ax equals B will not have a solution for some bees. There was some bees for she doesn't have a solution but be equal 0 there will be a solution for the homogeneous solution. And actually there's going to be more than one because it we look at this reduced row Echelon form. We see that there's going to be a free variable x 3 is a free variable. So let's write down the parametric solution will call x3s.  And this reduced row Echelon form here says X1 X2 X3 equals. Okay, x 1 is equal to -4/3 or x 1 - 4/3 s equal 0. So this is equal to 4/3 s  An X2 is equal to zero. This is the same thing we saw before.  Right. So this is ask X the vector 4/3 zero one. So it's one parameter family. It's a span of a single vector.  And then we also saw that this guy here the same coefficient Matrix, but with this be on the right hand side has no solution.  Right now we can see that from the registration form of the augmented Matrix. So that's the subtlety here. I said that to find the solution of an in homogeneous system. You just take the homogeneous solution and translated by a particular Vector. You have to be able to find a particular solution for that to work. Okay, and this case even though the homogeneous system has an infinite family infant a collection of of solutions the in homogeneous system with that B has no solution at all. So let me just summarize that and you can read this. It's in the textbook and it's on the slides. Now. This is the theorem I'll just say quickly in the last 30 seconds out loud.  Just because the homogeneous system always has a solution doesn't mean that the corresponding in homogeneous system with the same coefficient Matrix have any solutions that all some of them will some of them won't if they have any solutions that all they are described in this form by taking the homogeneous solution and translating it by some particular Vector, but that won't always be possible. Sometimes there's no solution at all. This is not a good computational tool if you're actually going to solve a system you always do the same thing, which is  Excellent. See you on Monday.
