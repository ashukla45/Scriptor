So please bring your questions they so if you have any questions content questions problems you and I work from the textbook anything like that.

So let's get started with today's lecture material moving on to section 2.1 Matrix operations. Now we have now since the very beginning actually been working with matrices matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers is sometimes square off and rectangular either wide or tall  and they've had a number of different interpretations, right? So at the beginning they came up as a simplified way of writing down a system of linear equations. We would remove all of the variable names and equal signs and write down the augmented Matrix associated with that system. And then do these automated row operations on it in order to simulate what would be doing to the equations to to save time?  But we also singled out part of that is the coefficient Matrix and we've been talking about all sorts of characterizations of things to do with vectors and equations that are properties of matrices and sometimes those properties depend on the interpretation of the Matrix whether it's an augmented Matrix Oracle efficient Matrix, for example, and that's all about the interpretation. But the actual operations are the same and now we're going to be thinking of matrices in a potentially new way right now, though. We'll see the we've already seen it and it's probably different guys in the last two lectures now, we're going to think of matrices as vectors now, what do I mean by that? Well, as I said are definition of what is a vector  Vectors are well. I said that they were just list of numbers. But what made them vectors is the fact that you can add them in Skillet X.  Fantastic crucial thing here because now we're going to soften the first statement vectors don't need to be list of numbers. I'm going to let a matrix be a vector The crucial thing is that I can add and scalar multiply matrices just the same way as vectors. So let's start with Edition. So here are three matrices and see their sizes are different the same size their to buy 3 and C is the Reversed 3 by 2. We're going to treat a and b as if they lived in some RN space think we're going to treat them like vectors in terms of doing linear operations on them. I can scale a matrix and I can add or subtract matrices. I can take linear combinations of matrices of the same size and the way I do it is just to add and scalar multiply each  Entries appropriately experimenter is appropriately so that is to say just like with column vectors if I'm going to add up.  Matrices then I add the like coefficients.  Okay, so I'll write those ones. I won't keep trying more colors. So I I compared the light coefficients to put them together. So for example, here's a linear combination of the two matrices. 2A - B A + B 2 a - be so how do I do this while the first thing I do is I multiply The Matrix a by 2.  So let's do it in two steps just to make it really clear. So if I multiply The Matrix a by 2 then just like with a vector that means that I scale all of the entries by 2. So that gives me 2 - 214  6 4 and 2 and I'm going to subtract from that the Matrix be  And now the way that I do that color coded there is two vectors just add or subtract whatever operation I'm going to do to the like coefficients. Okay, the 11 entries, I'll subtract 1 to enter Excel subtract that was and so on. So the first entry over here is 2-0, which is to get - 2 - 2 - 414 - 113 6-4 2-4 - 2 is 2 + 2 - 8 is -6  Okay, so that's how I do linear operations. That's how I take linear combinations of matrices. I forget the fact that they aren't columns there now a raise but I treat them just like I do with the columns doing those on your operations on them. Okay right now, let me go one more stuff here and say oh, well, you know now we would do our row operations on this well, so let's he would probably go but probably pivot the first one, although maybe we'd want to swap the first but  And so on right? That's what we do next, right?  Should tell by the tone in my voice that the answer is no that is not what we do next. There is no next and this is really important. It's a it's a common mistake to make the first time that you're seeing Matrix operations. We've been doing row reduction for a long time. Now, in fact, I've said explicitly the answer to every question in this class is row reduction. I lied. It's not it's the answer to most questions in this class, but you shouldn't automatically think row reduction every time you see a matrix if I'm doing addition and scalar multiplication of matrices row operations aren't in the mix no one operation and they're not right to do so that equals sign their make sense. It's the definition of how I have scalar multiply and add and subtract matrices in this case with that one there, They know it's true that that next step. I crossed out that Matrix down below is row equivalent to the first one I can get from first to second by row operation, but nobody asked you to do row operations when you're doing  Vector operations with matrices, you're not doing real operations. Guess it don't mix the two outro operations or something that you do. Once you have interpreted to Matrix in a certain way as the coefficient Matrix or augmented Matrix associate with system of equations, for example, and then the operations will help you answer questions about that system or if you want to answer questions about the columns like are they linearly independent or do they spend all of our too but we know that all well as I do similar operations, that'll help me answer those questions, but it doesn't mean that you could put an equal sign that you should do operations here. So if that's one thing to keep in mind, okay, so let's see what we can do next. So what have we learned here? So let's do a different sound for how about B+ to see? How do I how do I compute that?  shaking your head  why?  Exactly. They're not the same size. You cannot add them. So this is not defined.  You can only add matrices of the same exact size both be to buy 3 or 7 by 16 or whatever that you can't add two different matrices of different sizes. You could do the step two times so you can scale a x c by 2, but then you can't do anything with it with vieste to hear. Okay. So that's the first two kinds of Matrix operations scalar multiplication and addition just like four vectors.  Now these operations is operations behave for matrices exactly the same way they do for vectors. They have all the same kind of properties that you expect. They do from vector addition and multiplication and in particular from real addition and scalar multiplication. So if I add two matrices up, it doesn't matter what order I do the addition in and similarly if I had three of them up, it doesn't matter what order I bracket them and I could first ad and be and then it had see or I could first add BNC and then a day and I'll get the same results no matter what I can all of this has conditioned on the matrices all being the same size of his operations make sense.  Similarly as with vectors and with real numbers, there is an additive identity element. The zero is so for the 04 vectors at the zero Vector the vector with all zeros in the column and for matrices, it's the Matrix of the appropriate size with all 0 entries SOA was a 7 by 8 Matrix than the zero that you can use in this formula is the 7 by 8 0 Matrix just means all the entries are zero and if you put that in there and add it by definition, we just adding component.  And that means riding zero to every component but that doesn't change any component. So adding user of that nothing. It's the additive identity.  So that's the nice operates the nice properties of addition for matrices. And then there's also scalar multiplication and how it makes is in with Edition. So we will start with that last one there. So suppose I scale a matrix a buy some scalar s and then I take the resulting Matrix and scale it by are well, that's the same thing as just multiplying our times ass and using that to scale The Matrix a kind of associative multiplication log in law and also distributes over addition both ways. So I could take two matrices I can add them up and then scale them or alternatively I could scale each of the matrices.  And then add afterward and those give me the same result.  At the same time I could.  Add to scalars up and scalar Matrix, or I could use each of the Steelers to scalematrix an ad in the end. I got the same result property of real numbers have that vectors over scale over scalar multiplication have and it works exactly the same way for Matrix operations. Okay, so you don't have to memorize these things. It's just that you keep in mind that when you doing these operations they behave the way you would expect but I I just want to put it in and hear a warning.  It's two warnings one all only when the sizes match.  Okay, if a and b have different sizes than RC has different size than none of this makes sense. So all of this only makes sense when they have the same size and two.  beware  Not every property.  from real algebra  That algebra real numbers works for matrices.  Yeah... Means. We're going to see in a few minutes. So I'm the daughter one in particular that doesn't everything here does but you shouldn't take that as an example to say everything works the way I would expect. We'll see him in a moment.  Okay.  so  let's look at I think this is the same examples we saw before but now I want to talk about their interpretation. So I'm just giving you a new algebra. Will you can all do it. Now? How do I add instead of multiply matrices can do it easily and you shouldn't be expected to do it over and over you're not a computer would ask a computer to do it the questions. Why are we doing it? So I want to connect these operations to things that you've already been seen.  No, I just said matrices have come up in different interpretations so far. If a matrix is the Matrix of a linear system of equations that might The Matrix of the coefficient Matrix then in that context. Usually what we do in order to answer questions about the system is row operations not scalar or not. I did adding and then adding those two together will mean adding up the equations from the two different systems, which I guess technically makes sense, but it's not going to help you answer questions about either one of those systems. Okay. So, why would we add matrices together and the answer is that it comes from?  What we understood matrices as in the last two lectures.  Matrices can give us a new class of functions called linear transformations.  Linear Transformations, which we also call Matrix Transformations are functions of the form some function TT of a vector X is equal to a x x and we saw that that was a linear transformation. It's preserves addition and scalar multiplication. And then last name until it actually that's an equivalence the only functions that preserve edition of our Matrix Transformations. So here are two matrices and we could think of them as the standard matrices of two linear Transformations t&s. Quality corresponds to be clear and make sure we're all on the same page here. So those are linear Transformations Define from where to where what is the domain what size does X have to have for these to make sense?  Yeah, it's a three dimensional Vector right X is going to be in R3 because the matrices A and B. They have three columns and our definition of matrix multiplication of Matrix a by scalar is it take about via a vector is it take the components of that vector and use them as the coefficients in a linear combination of The Columns of a so we have to have the same number of entries in X as the number of columns in it up and then what's the output? So these these functions t&s. These are functions from R3.  R32 what where is the output someone from over here?  8 * X is what size Vector in this case.  I heard several people over here. Say it quietly, but I'd like someone to say it loudly.  Okay someone else in the room.  R2  because there's elk is a linear combination of The Columns of A & B on those are height to linear transformation.  Hey, it's a mapping. It's a rule that gives me something to domain and R3 and spits out something in the range. Now the range space R2 is a space of vectors.  So if there any operations I can do on vectors that I can do those operations on functions just like any if you're taking calculus or in your high school precalculus class if I give you two functions f x equals x squared in f x equal sign ex or GX + sinx, you can take the function f + G can take the function that you get by adding up those two functions, which is the function h of X is equal to x squared + sinx operations. You can do in the range you can do you can do in the in the go-to man. You can do to the functions. That means we can add up the two functions S&T because they're both functions that output to the same space are too and I taken put in the same space so t plus s is a new function and its value at X is equal to TX.  plus acid acts but by definition that means  ax  Plus BX.  Okay, but now by the linear properties of matrix multiplication. This is the same thing.  as a + b * X  Okay, that's how we've defined a and the sum of A and B and that's how it works. Okay. So in other words what we have is that this linear transformation t plus s  It's standard. Matrix is A + B. That's what the sum of two matrices is the sum of two matches of the same size is the standard Matrix of the sum of the two linear Transformations before going to add up when your transformation switch we might well do that means we add two matrices and that's what Matrix addition really means and similarly if we do scalar multiplication, right? So if we do our T of X, that means r x t f x which is our times a day of ax + by scalar multiplication of matrices as we just saw this is our times a applied to x 2 similarly that says that this linear transformation has this is it standard Matrix.  That's what it means the linear trance the the standard Matrix of the linear transformation. Do you get by multiplying the old one?  And it's important to keep that straight because for example just going back for a second here and the the first slide, you know, we multiply Day by to there and then we did that. We scaled all of the entries up by 2.  If the operation we were doing was a row operation, then we would probably do that one at a time. You're the first one by two and then the second one by two but you can't do them independently, when you're doing scalar multiplication scalar multiplication of a matrix by scalar means you scale all the entries at the same time. You can't choose which row or column you going to do it to keep that in mind.  All right. So that's what Edition is getting multiplication of matrices means it means we're taking addition and scalar multiplication of the linear Transformations that they represent.  So there's one other at least one other operation that we can do on scale on linear Transformations when they have appropriately matching sizes. So linear Transformations are functions if I have a function from here to here and a different function that starts where the other one ended go somewhere else that I can compose the functions that I can follow one function by the other so suppose. I have a function like tea here when your transformation from RN to RM some Eminem have a different linear transformation ass from RM to RK.  Jennifer some positive integers n M&K, then I can compose the two of them. I can follow as I can follow tea by us. Okay, so that means I can go from here to here and I get a new function which is called s Circle T order because the insides first and so that means another word. This is just under should be review for you not from the algebra book from previous courses just function ideas. So ask compose with T is the new function whose value at X is here's what you do you first evaluate.  Tfx that gives you a point in the range of tea, but the range of tea is in RM and RM is the domain of a switch means that you can hit that with us if that's composition of functions.  And I give this a new function.  The composition of two linear transformations of appropriate size its meaning that they're the codomain of tea is the same as the domain of s if those too much then we can compost.  Revenue function now linear Transformations aren't just any old functions that super special functions. They are linear the respect addition and scalar multiplication.  This composition I didn't tell you it's a linear transformation. All we know is that it's a function from our end to RK or end of November to RK, but actually it is another linear transformation. I want to show you why briefly here. So this this function that's composed with t let's see what it does to a sum of two vectors as compose with tea at you posed to be. Well, let's just write down what we just said the definition is that means we're taking s and hitting the vector T at U + V with it.  Now Let's ignore the ask for a moment. Just look in the side there with t of U + V T is a linear transformation so T of U + V. How does that relate to the values that you and pee?  Remember, what does a linear transformation do to a song?  someone like to raise their hand and tell me what T of U + V is equal to  yes.  It's equal to T of You + tfv8 respect the Edition not there could be many answers to the question. I just asked it was a bit open open-ended. So I was asking you to Intuit what the next step in this calculation ought to be  Okay, so great. So she is linear. And now this says that that valve function s compose with t if I hit you Busby with it, I get S at T of you plus 2 U V.  How does that help us say anything about ask compose with t this looks complicated, but let's just change notation a little bit. Let's call this a vector X and this Vector why? Okay, so exit Vector two of you. Why is the vector TV?  Okay, I'm looking to team that's our end into RM X and Y are vectors in RM just to be clear as we're going through this. So let's rewrite. This says that this is s of x + y.  But as is also a linear transformation, which means that it respects Edition, so that's equal to S of x + S of Y.  And now let's remember what X and Y are from one line above their.  X is equal to T of you  And why is equal to t a v?  And now we're in something which actually tells us about s compose with t because look up at the top right there as compose with C is the function.  Which does t and then follows it with us and here we have written operations involving exactly that Duty and then follow ass after work in each of those two slots and other words. This is just ask compose with t that you plus s compose with t. V.  So what does that say? Just going from the beginning of the equation to the end?  That says we've shown that ass compose with T is is a function with a property that its value on you posed to be asked him was with T8 you posed to be is you supposed to eat at V.  That says that s composers T respect Edition that you can push Escobar's with cheese through the addition and a very similar calculation will show you that you can push scalar multiplication through S compose with t as well, I won't write down all the steps. It looks very similar.  So that says that s compose with t respect.  addition and scalar multiplication  But that's what it means to be a linear transformation s compose with T is a linear transformation.  So if I have two linear Transformations and the codomain of one of them is the same as the domain of the other so that it makes sense to compose them as functions the composition of the two gives a new linear transformation function, which has the same nice properties of respect addition and scalar multiplication.  That last day we saw that any linear transformation has a standard Matrix any linear transformation is multiplication by some Matrix.  You know here I gave you a S&T. I didn't tell you what their matrices were. Although we know and should remember that if I can figure out the actions of S&T on the standard basis vectors, then I know what are matrices are. That's how we figured out. We have a matrix in the first place, but I didn't use the matrices of S&T in any way here. All I used was the abstract linear transformation properties.  Your question. Yes.  Respect addition and scalar multiplication. I tried to write a shorthand and now I'm going to end up writing it longhand in spending more time. Sorry respect Edition.  and scalar multiplication  I guess you know, well, you're studying if you take everything we've done and reduce it down to 10 pages. And then you take that 10 pages and reduce it down to one page that you would take that one page and we're just sat down to one sentence and that one sentence reduced down to one word. Probably not going to help very much. Right. So there's a limit to how much shortening you can effectively do and maybe I went a little too far their story.  Okay, so as I was saying I didn't use the matrices of S&T here in any way, but the thing to remember now to is S&T have matrices. They are given by matrix multiplication and the mere fact that is composed with T is a linear transformation as we just proved shows that it has a matrix as well.  So how would the Matrix of s composed of TV related to the matrices of S&T is the question before us?  So let's figure that out right now.  So same as in the last that I have a linear transformation T from RN to RM of a linear transformation, ask RM to RK and we're still doing this this served in general here. We're not being specific examples, but of course, we will do specific examples in the moment. Don't worry and besides this.  To each of them has a matrix T has has has a matrix A&S has a matrix B. I just to be clear. So we remember how this works. So if T is a linear transformation from R2 RM than the Matrix a has what size somebody from over this half of the room.  m x n m x n  an S. It's Matrix B will be of size K by m.  Alright, so  a is m x n that means it has M Rose and N columns. So that's as we usually do. Let's think of it as stringing together. It's called that has n columns.  Know what I'm going to do here is I want to figure out what the Matrix of s compose with Tia's.  So let's just start messing around using the properties of matrix multiplication. We know what the matrices A and B are Tia's so we need to do is figure out as compose with t that should be given by multiplication by some Matrix. What Matrix is it? How do we figure that out? Well, we know what S&T do by 30 is given by multiplication by a so let's first right that  I'd let's write the vector X here as usual. So the Victor X is in RN.  the multiplication of a BX. In terms of The Columns of a all that means by definition is we use x to give the coefficient of the linear combination of The Columns of a  okay. So now I've written that things out it has a mixture of a sand and the Matrix a before I use the fact that ass is given by my location by be let's just use the abstract linear properties of the linear transformation s s respect addition and scalar multiplication as respect superpositions. We have the superposition principle that that says that we can take next one x s of a 1 + X2 X S of a to down the line.  Okay. So what we've learned from this is it to figure out what s compose with t does 2x. I really only need to know what the linear transformation ask does to The Columns of a  but this is given by multiplication by matrix be so this is b x a one this one is b x a to etcetera.  Xn there be times again.  so what I get is a linear combination of  d x a 1D X A2 up to be X a.m.  Hey, those are some column vectors if I take a column Vector a 1 + x The Matrix B, which I can do cuz the sizes match up.  I get a new column Vector. I'm taking a linear combination of those column vectors, but what I've written here is exactly.  we like to encode as  The Matrix whose entries whose columns are those new columns  X the column vector  facts  I know I have written test compose with t entirely in terms of the matrices A and B because this statement right here the eskimos with t a tax is equal to  this Matrix right here.  x x  that tells us that this Matrix right here.  This is the standard Matrix.  of Eskimos with t  That's a circle not a no, it doesn't say sought as compose with t.  Okay, so that's the answer to this question. If I have too many Transformations who's codomain of the first matches the domain of the second so I can compose them that means their composition which is linear transformation has a standard Matrix and that's it right there. And it's something we can now compute. It's just a little extension of matrix multiplication. We already Define I give you two matrices A and B.  I write out a The Columns of a and I do the matrix multiplication of each column of a by B. And then I String those together that gives me a new Matrix instead of a vector. It's a matrix. That is the Matrix of s composed with T. So there's the definition that I just said out loud one more time written down.  And that is how we Define matrix multiplication. So we already knew how to multiply a matrix times a vector.  Hey, as long as the number of columns of the Matrix matches the number of entries of the vector. We knew how to define that would you find that about 2 weeks ago and now I'm telling you look let's just extend that a little bit and see if I've got two matrices then I'll Define the product of the two matrices more or less the same way. I just do it Colin wise k i x a by multiplying be by each of the columns of a and string them together.  Assuming that the sizes match for that to make sense. So let's do an example right now. So here are two matrices. Okay, let's look at their sizes fixed here is has three rows into columns. The second one is two by two it has two rows into columns.  In order for this matrix multiplication to make sense even just call him was from the definition. We know that the number of entries in each of the columns for the second Matrix has to match the number of entries in the rows of the first Matrix. That is the number of columns of the first Matrix what that means when you're looking at their sizes is that the two inside numbers have to match  For that to even make sense and they do they're so that means we can make sense of this and let's just write down exactly by definition what this is supposed to be. So the definition of this matrix product we take that first Matrix. Okay that first Matrix, let's call it be there. And this one is a that means we take betimes the First Column of a as the First Column of our Matrix and betimes the second column of a  as the second column for Matrix. So let's let's work that out exactly.  so be times the First Column that means we take one and two and use it as a linear combinations of The Columns of B is let me write it explicitly that's going to be 1 * 4 + 2 * -2  In the second entry. It's going to be 1 * -3.  + 0 * 200 + 2 * 0 I guess we should write it as and then finally 1 * 3.  + 2 * 5  so that's the First Column. Let me actually write a, here to make sure we understand that's just the First Column of the Matrix B times a day for the second column. We have to use the coefficients in the second column of a as the linear combinations of The Columns of be so now we have 3 * 4 - 1 x - 2  3 * -3  + -1 * 0  and 3 * 3  -1 * 5  okay, so now let's simplify that I get 4 - 4 which is 0 - 3 + 0 which is -3  3 + 10 which is 13 for the First Column. The second column is 12 + 2 + 14 - 9 - 0 - 9 + 9 - 5 which is for that's it. And actually just like with matrix multiplication if I have a matrix by a column Vector if I don't want to go through the steps that I did here and think of it as a linear combination of The Columns of the first by the entries in the second right by the columns in the second. I can do the second way of thinking about that by multiplying the entries in the first row of be by the First Column of a and adding them up which is exactly what we were in there. And you know, that would give me this entry here and multiplying in this one.  Buy this one gives me that entry there and so on so you should do lots of practice problems like this as you are doing on your homework, of course.  But that's the end of the story about matrix multiplication really represents what it represents is the composition of the phagocytic linear Transformations, but mechanically it's a very easy thing to do is just an extension of what you've already been doing with matrix multiplication of a matrix by column Vector. Okay. So let's do another example hear about these two matrices. How do I multiply these two  You don't someone said that's right. You don't and why don't I know just cuz I'm tired after doing the first one, but because this one's to buy two and this one's three by two these guys don't match.  So you can't X if it doesn't even make sense, but I want you to look at something.  The Matrix here the first one here, that's a that's the same one that's up there and the Matrix down here that's be so if I were to make sense of this this one would be a * B  Sobe x a is this particular Matrix here, which is 3 by 2 and a x b does not even make sense. This is the warning that I gave you last time. Last fight.  Not every property of real algebra is going to translate to Matrix algebra.  In real algebra doesn't matter what order you multiply numbers but in Matrix algebra, not only does it matter what order it can fail to make sense to multiply in one order. Even if it doesn't the first okay, here's an example b x a makes perfect sense, but a x b is not even defined.  all right, so no other than that most of the other properties of  real multiplication make perfect sense and and are satisfied by matrix product. That is matrix product is associative. I can multiply 8 * B and then see afterward or I can multiply be 10 cm in a beforehand as long as I keep the order straight.  Matrix multiplication is distributive over Matrix addition that can do the adding before or after the product on either side and scalar multiplication of a matrix distributes through and that's no problem. You can scale the most by any of the matrices it won't matter which order you do it.  And also just like there's an additive identity the zero Matrix, there's also a multiplicative identity here. So if I have an M by n Matrix, then I can * certain Matrix called the identity Matrix that we know and love to get the same Matrix back. I can buy a buy I get a again the caveat is that depending which side you want to multiply on you have to use a different size Matrix if a is M by n  Then if I'm going to multiply on the left.  I need to use an MBM identity Matrix for those two to match. Whereas I used to have a you need to use an end by an identity Matrix.  For them to match if I do it on the right different sizes identities on different sides sides if the matrices are not square and that identity Matrix there. That's the one that we saw last lecture as the standard Matrix of the identity function in Matrix algebra. It also is the identity function X. It gives you the same answer back just as you're going through your Matlab you've already seen that the command for the identity Matrix in Matlab is i e y e n s Racine. Is it a b  Is generally not equal to ba.  And that's not just some abstract weird algebraic fact that is a property of our world. I'd like to volunteers to come down to do a demonstration if you don't mind, but anyone like to come down in the ocean, yes, come on one other person, please.  Okay, come on down. Come on up. Okay, remember last day and the day before we talked about rotations rotations are examples of linear Transformations. So that means that I can do multiplication of the matrices associated with them by composing the rotations composing means do one rotation than the other afterwards. So we're going to do linear algebra right now as a contact sport, so here are two rotations. So I want you to rotate 90 degrees to word that wall.  Hey, I know I want you to rotate 90 degrees down onto your face.  Okay, fine. If you want. No, just done enough just him those were two rotations that he just did 90\u00b0 that way and then 90\u00b0 that way now you're going to do those two in the other order the first you're going to do 90 degrees that way.  Good and now 90\u00b0 that way.  Look are they in the same position? So we composed two rotations this one and that one versus that one versus that one and that one the same two rotations in the two orders. We did a x be here. Would it be times a day there? And we got totally different answers a x b is not equal to b x light. Let's give them a hand.  Three-dimensional rotations don't commute with each other it matters what order you do the rotations it so there's no way around this.  Typically the fact if you just pick two random matrices.  They will not compete with each other two very special when too much just commute. It doesn't happen that often. Let's try that right now. Let's pick two random matrices. I want eight random numbers. So shut them out from the crowd.  I got it. I heard a 4.  473 and 4 and then four more numbers  298  Third okay that I didn't hear that one again. Sorry. I heard about her two three. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Good.  All right. Let's multiply these two matrices in that order just for practice here for 734 * 2983.  Okay, so doing the set of shorthand way, but I'm going to do is multiply so that that row by that column to get the first entry. What's 4 * 2 + 7 * 8 so that's 8 + 7 * 8 so that gives me 64.  For the second entry I get 4 * 9 + 7 * 3 + 36 + 21, which is 57. I see why I didn't want to hear. You said 37 3 * 2 is 6 + 4 * 8 which is 32, so that gives me 38.  + 3 * 927 + 12 is 39. So there is the product of those two matrices in that order. Now, let's take the same two matrices and multiply them.  in the reverse order  So I'm going to feel like an idiot if he's actually commute but they want they want a list of the first one there to * 4 + 9 * 3 * 2 * 4 is 8 + 27 is 35 and actually we don't even need to go any further. Look at that.  Those two are not equal.  Hey, so I'm not going to finish the algebra. You guys can do that.  I picked to Macy's out of thin air and I got two different answers for the products in the two different ways. That's pretty much always going to happen. If I write down what a matrix then the set of matrices that commute with it is a small set relatively speaking and actually we can explore that a little bit more when we have a little more language in a few weeks. Okay, so that's matrix multiplication.  That is so that's all I'm going to say about the definitions of matrix multiplication. But we're going to be using it from now on the key thing to remember is Matrix addition scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication. They mostly work the way you expect algebra to work. The two cabinets being sizes need to match appropriately and that means different things from application versus Edition. And the second thing is that well addition commutes multiplication of matrices typically does not commute it matters what order and actually it might matter what order whether it even makes sense or not. But even if it makes sense to multiply in either order the answers will typically be different.  Okay, and in the last 2 minutes is one more Matrix operation that I want to highlight here.  Okay, it's a very very easy one mechanically to do. I'm only going to tell you mechanically what it how to do it. It does have a geometric interpretation. It does have an interpretation in terms of linear Transformations, but it's a little more sophisticated. We'll get to it and week 9, okay what it means but for now, it's going to be a useful tool to have around it's just a just a mechanical thing called the transpose. So if I take a matrix an M by n Matrix  It's transpose is an N by m Matrix It swaps and an m and the way that it does that is to swap the rows of a with The Columns of the output. It's a look at that.  So to take the transpose of a matrix.  you just  flip it on its side that you take the rose of a and you write them as The Columns of a new Matrix. That's it. That's what transpose is. So let's just quickly here not too quickly. But let's just since we don't need any more time. Let's compute the transpose of these two matrices. So here's the Matrix a 3 by 3 by 3 by 3. And all I do is I turn it on right side that first row - 510 I turn into the column.  better than that 2 - 3/4 turn into the column + 013  That's it. So it's through this Matrix over here is one of the three by three example, so here I'm going to I'm going to do the same thing. That's even do the colors to make it clear and I'm taking this First Column this first row there and I'm making it the First Column of this Matrix.  And then the second column.  I'm making that II II Raw making the second column over here.  And this third row 6-1 for I'm turning that into the third column over here.  There we go. See totally different Matrix.  White let's let's look did I do it wrong?  Actually, it's the same Matrix.  What happened?  What happened is that this is a cooked up example. This Matrix is called a symmetric Matrix a matrix that gives you its own transpose. Matrix is equal to its own transport is called a symmetric Matrix. So when I did the transpose there, it actually gave me the same answer back because the columns in the Rose have the same numbers in them when you reflect across the bag and I didn't change most matrices are not like that but they are super important matrices in the last week of the class will explain why it's so that's the transpose. I've written down its algebra properties here. Okay, the most important one probably is that it doesn't respect multiplication, but it reverses it, but that's probably going to be necessary for us until week 9, so we'll talk about that more then and that's where we're finished for today. See you on Wednesday.  one minute early guys  UC San Diego podcast ",
