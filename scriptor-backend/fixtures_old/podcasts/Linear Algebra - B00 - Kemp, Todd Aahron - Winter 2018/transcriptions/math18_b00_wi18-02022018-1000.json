What you do with that information is up to you if you ended up doing kind of lousy on this midterm, but you expected to do kind of lousy because you had this going on or because you didn't actually study enough and you know, why you didn't do well and you feel like you can correct that then great.  After all remember the grading policy is that if one of your midterms is much higher than the other and you do well on the final then the lower midterm won't end up counting the credit from your lowest midterm can't get transferred to the final if that ends up benefiting your grade in the end.  If on the other hand, you see that you're one of the few people who did quite poorly on the midterm and you don't really know why you didn't quite poorly then you might think about whether this isn't the right time to continue with this course and try taking it again in the future. This is one of those times when if you have such concerns, please go ahead and email me guess is probably not the right place for them. This is not going to be something that affects many of you. Okay. So look at your grade. Look at your exam. Go ahead and email me if you have some concerns and I'll try to be as responsive this afternoon and evening as I can be.  For the time being there. So watch out for that for the time being we're going to proceed. So now we're going to go on with the lecture material for today after two more quick reminders. Your next Matlab assignment is due next week next Friday when we from today at 11:59 p.m. I see from Piazza that many of you are already working on it. That's great. And you're next MyMathLab homework site, which is a doozy. It's double length because it covers two weeks of material is due on Monday, February 12th a week from this coming Monday.  All right, so I'd like to now proceed.  With the lecture topic for today, which is as we saw here is 2.2 and 2.3 the inverse Matrix are the Matrix of the inverse of a matrix. Next time will actually continue a little bit with that at the beginning of the next lecture and then proceed to chapter 4. So as your reading ahead you should now be starting to look at chapter 4  Alright, so here's the idea for what we're going to be talking about today. I'm going to go back again to grade school algebra, okay.  Where the first kind of algebraic equation you ever saw was something like a x equals B. Now when you saw it in 7th grader or whenever it was it didn't have a and be there at had to x equals 4, right or 3x equals 6 or something like that.  And you solve for x and you know, this is very silly. But let's do it nauseatingly explicitly. How would we solve for x get well first things first?  if a  is 0  Then you can't solve for x.  If x equals zero, then this equation says 0 * x equals B 0 equals B, and that's why the true or false it's true. If B is also zero which case so it's a true statement for all X or it's false if B is not zero, but if a is not 0  Okay, then we got up here. We have this equation ax equals B.  Okay. Well, we actually already discussed this.  in the second or third lecture  What we do here is Robert option is just one row. There's only one rule operation that's needed which is to Pivot but let's think for a moment about what that really means. What does it mean? What does it mean to divide through what we're really doing is we're multiplying both sides of this equation by another number 1 / a  and then were using the properties of multiplication which say that if I multiply one of her a x ax  That's the same thing as one of right * a * X. It's that distributive property.  I rather expect associative property has this number which has the property that 1/8 * 8 is 1  that's how it's defined.  And so what we got is well, I've already made a mistake because I didn't carry through the equal sign when I divide you buy a I better do it on both sides, right?  And so finally that tells me putting this all together that I've solved x equals be over, right? Okay, so they're that's how we solve linear equations in one variable.  Now, what about a matrix equation x equals B to be clear. We know how to solve Matrix equations now, we're experts at it. Right we use Road.  And we have all sorts of things that tell us how it's going to go what kind of outcomes we can expect but let's very briefly forget all of that and say well can we do the same thing that we did in this, you know, seventh grade algebra type of situation. Can we divide by a is there a 1 / a 1 / a matrix a that I can use here and multiply both sides by one of our way to solve the equation. That's the sort of question. I want to address in. The answer is sometimes yes sometimes no, but we will be able to understand how that 1/8 works when it exists. So let's look at a specific example.  To start. So here's a matrix equation. Here's the Matrix a  I never said I could be over there. This is a 2 by 3 Matrix and I want to solve this Matrix equation ax equals B.  So if I wanted to follow suit what I did above I need to find one over a what is that mean? What looking carefully over here what it means what we needed.  Was this property right here?  We needed to find a matrix a one-by-one matrix with the property that 1/8 * 8 is equal to 1.  One being the multiplicative identity of the real numbers. So similarly if we want to make that exact thing work there. It seems what we need to do is find a matrix one over a or whatever you want to call it. I'm a Trixie call itzy.  So that c x a is the identity Matrix because the identity Matrix x axis is X is B.  Okay, so well, let's actually just work this out. I've cooked this one up here. Let's supposed to do the multiplication first things first. Tell me how big is the Matrix e x a what size does it have?  Two by two, right? Cuz the first one is to buy 3 second one is three by to the insides match. So the product makes sense the outsides are too and to so it's a two-by-two matrix.  I must work out what it is.  Okay, I'm going to multiply that column by that column.  And I just made that entry and what is it? Well, it's 1 - 0 + 0 which is 1  then I'm going to multiply that First Column by the that first row by the second column of a that gives me 1 - 1 + 0 which is 0  Next I will multiply the second row of sea by the first row of a 0 + 0 + 0 + finally the second row of sea by the second column of a 0 + 1 + 0 + 1. + hey.  That is the two by two identity Matrix. So we've found a one of her a we found a matrix so that if I multiply a by it on the left where does key here as we go forward because remember that much are matrix multiplication doesn't commute in general.  So that c x a is the identity Matrix.  Okay. So how's that going to help us exactly? Mimic the algebra? That's at the top there. So we're starting with this equation.  Up here, which is a x equals B.  So what I'm going to do is multiply both sides by a  c x a v i c c x ax equals c b that's just true.  Okay, because I have to go to be there for c x x equals e x b and I use the associative property of matrix multiplication.  But we just saw that c x a is the identity Matrix. So this is the identity Matrix X be noticed that all the dimensions matchup fee is  hold on.  seedtime speak story  what's better?  c x p  this is I X X better than x is a two-dimensional Vector. So it makes sense X the 2 by 2 identity Matrix. So I get comparing these two that tells me Ax equals c d s l looks like I'm solving equation same way about  Well, you don't let's just let's just double-check that let's let's see what the solution is. The solution is c x be here apparently, so let's multiply.  C * B  1 - 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1. Okay, that's that's pretty easy to do 0 + 0 + 0 for the first century + 0 + 0 + 0  the second entry  So the solution is x equal 0.  Does that make sense?  Can you tell from the tone of my voice that doesn't make sense? Hopefully you can also tell just by looking that doesn't make sense.  because a * 0  is 08 any Matrix times 0 is 0 and that's not equal to be.  That's weird. I thought we solved it, but it looks like we got a wrong solution.  And actually it's even worse than that because we know how to solve this equation x equals B, right we use.  A great great. Yes. We use row reduction.  So let's do that 1 0 1 1 1 2 is the coefficient Matrix and the bee on the Atlantic column of 001. So let's do one step of row reduction will subtract the first row from the Third.  And then extra let's do one more step of row reduction now subtract the second row from the Third.  What what is this tell me about this equation?  It'll be the equation doesn't exist.  It's inconsistent. Thank you.  I guess I just didn't hear you. Right this is an inconsistent equation that has no solution.  So what on Earth is going on here? But what on Earth is going on here is we have to be very careful about logical implications. We have to be very careful about how the words we use are put together and interpreting what they mean. What we did over here was we followed the schematic from up there and said, I want to find a solution of x equals be so if I if I have an X such that ax equals B, then then this tells me that X has to equal that CB over there. Then that's true. There's no escaping that the important thing was the first word in that sentence if I have a solution X  In reality, there is no solution.  Okay, so if you start a phrase with  Without an antecedent. That is false.  If it is Saturday today, then I am named Bob. That is a true statement because it's not Saturday today and that's what happened here. So let's look at that more closely.  So we're as I said we started with this system. We want to solve ax equals B.  And we wanted to follow the great school algorithm and find a 1 / a 2 x so we want to find a sea so that c x a is the identity Matrix and I'm just being very careful about the sizes of the things are going to have to be because be was an n-dimensional Vector. It was an environment tricks ideas and Emma dimensional Vector an ax is an n-dimensional Vector. So if we want to multiply something by X going to have to be at the End by an identity Matrix, so that tells us what size is she has to be like we had in this example. Hey was three by 2 so she has to be to buy 3 in order for this to even make sense.  Okay, and what we found was that if ax equals B, then x equals c b that is a logically true statement.  But what we really wanted was the converse of that statement. We wanted to know if x equals c b then ax equals B. We want to know that is a solution not that if there's a solution then it's this because that turns out to be false in this case. We can't detect it using this algorithm using row reduction we can okay. So that's a critical point here not in the calculus of critical point. That's an important Point here and x equals c * B. That is true. It's just that the thing before the implication sign the first part of the F statement is false. And so the conclusion can be false as well. No suppose on the other hand.  That we had a c that we could multiply a on the right.  Buy to get the identity Matrix. Here is a really brilliant demonstration of the non commutative matrix multiplication. Okay. This is a different property suppose that a has a right one over and one of these were the inverse moment suppose that there's a c so that a Time sequels the identity instead of the sea X able to fit well then.  Ax equals c * B is a solution.  2 ax equals by well, we can just check it.  We wanted to know if this is a solution. So let's just check if it's a solution a x x which is a x c b.  Is equal to a c x b but AC is the identity Matrix and that gives me be just as we said. Yes.  so  And that is the reverse implication the one that we wanted if x equals c b then ax equals b + 2 for X to be a solution. That's the direction of the arrow that needs to go.  Okay. So let's check again. We knew something went wrong in this example from the last Light. So let's check again what it is.  So we saw that the matrices hear the one we started with the a matrix from the last slide was the tall one this one and this was The Matrix e and we saw that c x a was the identity. But what about a time see? That's the important Point here as we see here if if a Time C is the identity then we have that CB is a solution.  So let's work it out here. Now the size of this Matrix is bigger.  It's a 3 by 3 Matrix now. So we have the first entry is 1 + 0 + x that column that row by that column. So there I get one.  Let's do the next one down.  Let's do this one.  And that's going to give me 0 + 0 all this is looking good. That's so far matching the identity Matrix and then the next one down is 1 + 0.  This is not the identity Matrix and if we fill in the rest we find this.  This is not the appropriate size identity Matrix.  So a times C is not the identity even though c x a is  Okay, so there's a huge subtlety here owing to the fact that matrix multiplication is not commutative. That's why the elementary or grade school type of approach is not may be the best approach but we're going to push this little further because sometimes we really can make it work. Sometimes a C&C a will both be at the identity and then it's going to work the way you would expect. Okay.  So let's get some language going on here. So for now and actually will see why forever. I'm going to restrict to the case it when were talking about Anna versus restrictive the case where a is a square Matrix.  suppose a is an N by n Matrix  We call such a matrix invertible.  Yeah, following what we did on the last two slides if there is a c satisfying CA.  And AC are both the identity Matrix.  Okay.  And in that case we did note this Matrix. See we call it. Not one over a we call it a ^ -1 which is another symbol we use for taking reciprocals of real numbers and that's a little more compact notation. So we use that for matrices if there's a matrix see that has this property that c * a + 8 * C are both the identity Matrix then we call that thing the inverse of a we say that a is invertible.  All right. So we saw on the last slide that there was in a non Square case without with a matrix a where there was a season that CA is the identity.  But that sea did not satisfy AC is the identity. Okay. So in that case that Matrix was not invertible.  When is a matrix going to be invertible? How can we tell when can we expect this to happen? Well, let's think back to the implications that we saw on the last slide for that. We saw that you know, if there is a left inverse if there's a c that I can help on the left to get the identity.  Then we get that if I have a solution, it's given by c x b can we get the forward application now? Let's think about a little bit about that means.  Suppose so it's saying suppose that I know there is a solution. This says that that solution is x equal CV in particular its unique if there is a solution then I've got a formula for it. It's c x be that formula might not be correct. There might not be a solution. So what this tells us is if there's a see that you can multiply on the left to get the identity.  Then were in the situation where we know we have no or one solution.  Okay, if you think about it, that's the same thing as a being that Matrix of a one-to-one linear transformation, then we'll get into all of those things. Later.  So let's write that down our observation that we just made so here were talking about uniqueness of the solution uniqueness. So  is there  at most  at most one solution for it to be  for any given B  That's the uniqueness question.  and what we just observed is that this  is equivalent to their being  A c on the left. That's there's a c so that c x a is the identity. And by the way, remember we have a mechanical way using row reduction to check whether this is true. How do you tell if there is going to be at most one solution?  Bydureon row reduction. What's the thing you look for? Yes.  Are you guys all got this right on the midterm yesterday aren't many many of you. Almost. Have you got it, right? So you should feel confident in telling me right now. Yes.  Great, if all the columns are pivotal.  So this is actually how we can tell if we have a c on the left if you can multiply a by a c on the left if there's a cisa that CA is the identity that happens if and only if all the columns of a are pivotal  Okay, let's look back at our example from the first slide. There's r a  are all of its columns pivotal.  Well, we could do one step a row reduction to check but we can also use a theorem which tells us that all the columns are pivotal. If and only if all the columns are linearly independent that was questioned to see on the midterm yesterday an example, which actually was one that few more of you had trouble with so we're definitely going to talk about that more as we go.  The Columns there are indeed linearly independent when you have two columns. It's easy to tell you look and see if they are parallel those two are not parallel, right? The second is not a multiples of first and therefore a does have all columns pivotal and indeed we found a c's of the sea times as the identity of demonstration of this theorem that I'm saying here that they're having a left inverse is the same as having all columns pivotal.  Okay, but now let's look at the other way. I'm sorry for zooming around the slides too much but you hopefully downloaded it yesterday so you can follow more easily.  Let's look at the second one here suppose that we haven't a Caesar that a times C is the identity so you can multiply on the right to get the identity. Well, then we could check.  That's e x b was a solution there. We saw yeah, there is a solution that that one is a solution but this is like when we're doing and how Virginia systems and talked about a particular solution. Yeah, I can find some particular solution started by pulling it out of thin air and some sense, but that doesn't mean it's the only solution just cuz I can check that c x be as a solution doesn't mean it's the only one.  So having a c that you can multiply on the right, okay is the same thing as big as the existence question. Okay is the system consistent?  for every B  no matter what be you put their can I solve it is there at least one solution?  And that we just saw is the same as finding a sea, you can multiply on the right to get the identity.  So having a right inverse, which The Matrix was at the beginning of the lecture doesn't path.  Is the same thing?  As the system being consistent ax equals B being consistent for every B.  Those are the two paradigms here one to one vs. Onto having consistent for everybody versus having at most one solution for everybody.  And now we have another condition for those which is having a left in versus left inverse versus having a right Converse and finally the very first condition from the beginning using row reduction in this case. How do we check mechanically using row reduction? If it's true that the system is always consistent.  If all rows are pivotal.  Okay, guys.  Now we have a serum. We have just proved rigorously a theorem and the theorem is  that a is invertible.  if and only if  all rows and all columns  heart of it all  And now you see why we're only going to talk about Square matrices when we talked about in versus these two conditions are impossible to satisfy. If you have a rectangular Matrix if your Matrix has more rows and columns.  Then there's guaranteed to be some non pivotal rose, right? You can only have at most one pivot pero and four column. So there's only three columns. You can't have any more than 3 pivots, but if you got for Rose forget it one of them cannot be at least one and the same thing on its side. If there are more columns and rows then at least one column is not in order for it to be even possible for there to be every row and every column pivotal.  The Matrix must be square that doesn't mean that every Square Matrix is invertible again don't reverse that implication. This is another going to basic logic thing that we need to keep running by on our heads cuz we're mathematicians in this room. Okay, and we make sure that we understand all statements pedantically in precisely.  I just said that if a matrix is invertible, then it must be square. That doesn't mean that if a matrix is square. It's invertible. If it's raining then the street is wet that's a true statement. But if the street is wet does it follow that it's raining Diego usually not be careful implications go One Direction only typically now one more thing here in terms of mechanically. How do we recognize this? If and only if every row and column or pivotal the way we recognize that?  as we look at the reduced row Echelon form of a  and find that it's the identity Matrix. Must be the registration form if we're going to have every row and every column pivotal. So there's our condition. Now, we know how to check if a matrix has an inverse if a matrix is invertible at all.  Okay, so I'm just restated that on this slide once again, so if it's solvable for any B of x equals vs Oliver for any B.  That is the same thing as every row pivotal.  And if it has at most one solution for every B. That's the same thing as every column pivotal As We Know?  and therefore a inverse exists  if and only if the reduced row Echelon form of a is the identity Matrix.  So let's look at a few examples here. So here is a matrix 1/2 1/4.  Is every column pivotal I mean it for two by 2 Matrix we can chat looked Texas by looking the second column is not a multiple of the first those are linearly independent. They're four. They're both pivotal. How about every row same deal to 4 is not a multiple of one one, right? Those are linearly independent Rose. If you want to think about it that way you can also do one step of row reduction to check that every road. There is pivotal so that Matrix is going to be invertible. And actually I've pulled out of thin air what the inverse is here. It is. Let's just double-check.  Let's do the multiplication. I get 2 + -1 is 1 - 1/2 + 1/2 + 0.2 * 2 - 4 + 2 x - 1/2 which is -1 + 4 * 1/2 which is to the -1 + 2 is so that's why we've just seeing if I call this Matrix a and this one see we just seen the daytime see is the identity but we went through a whole lot of trouble at the beginning because we ignore the fact that in general that doesn't imply that c x a is the identity. We need to have it on both sides. So let's check that it works on the other side as well. This one is c x a so here I get to - 112 - 2 0  -1 + 1 is 0 + -1 + 2 is 1 it does work so that one is invertible.  Okay now.  Now, let me go back and say actually we didn't need to check here. That sounds like a contradict what I said before but we have a theorem up above that. We actually proved on the last slide which is a square Matrix is invertible. If and only if every row and every column is pivotal.  Okay, we already know that this Matrix is invertible. We already know there will be a see that works on both sides. And since we found that it works on one side, it automatically works on the other but that's only for square matrices. That's the caveat here 3 by 3 1  This one it's again easy to tell just by looking.  That every row and every column is pivotal. Okay, this Matrix is already almost in reduced row Echelon form. If I would have carried this Matrix to reduced row Echelon form. All I have to do is Pivot the second and third rows by the second one by 2 in the third one by 3. And I have the identity Matrix and that was our condition. So I know this Matrix is invertible. How do I find the inverse? I haven't said anything about finding inverses yet. Well, when once more I'm just going to pull out of thin air how this works and then we can double-check it in this case. It turns out that if you have a diagonal matrix like this one meaning that the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal then it's inverse is easy to find you just take the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the reciprocals of the diagonal entries here.  And if you go ahead and work this out, I'm not going to do all 9 multiplications. But certainly the first one is 1 + 0 + 0 Let's see that the one below that is 0 + 0 + 0 so I'm I'm doing now say This One X that one that gives me this entry and that gives me 0 + 0 + 0 which is 0 and if you feel this all in yourself.  You're going to see that you got that done today Matrix.  So that's a that's one easy place to to look if you're if you're looking for an invertible Matrix if your Matrix is diagonal.  Then it'll be invertible provided that it fits the mold provided that it has a pivot in every row and column now if this Matrix that this diagonal matrix had had a zero where the three is for example, this procedure wouldn't have worked. We would have had to put a 1/0 there which doesn't make sense, but that's because if there's a zero and that lower right corner, then this Matrix does not have the identity Matrix has its reduced row Echelon form. It will not be invertible so they can't be an inverse to find.  Okay.  All right. Now let's talk very briefly about relation to linear Transformations. I already said this out loud earlier, but let's check again and our minds so remember that we have a linear transfer. We have a matrix we can think of it as a linear transformation given by multiplication by that Matrix a  And we already had some different language for the same concept. Remember we're talking about solvability. What type of consistency that is. If x equals B has a solution for every B. That's the same thing as saying that that linear transformation is onto  Where's if we said that ax equals B has at most one solution for every bee that's the same thing.  And as I commented before if we have a left inverse the seagulls on the left and which goes on the left that means the first condition that you can solve it for everybody. So having a left inverse means that he is on too and that's the same thing as every row pivotal. Whereas the second condition having a unique solution or no solution, which is the same thing is keeping one to one. That means you have a right inverse a x and verse is dead. So I'm just really emphasizing hear that all of these concepts are just the same ideas using different language is so we can connect back to the words one to one and onto for a linear transformation and what we see now is that a linear transformation is invertible or has an invertible Matrix.  If and only if it is both one-to-one and onto this was a question that came up on Piazza luck. Can you have on at the Opposites of each other? No, they're not opposites. You can have both at the same time as we come out of their lots of examples, for example, any rotation Matrix is a rotation as a linear transformation is both one-to-one and onto it's reversible its invertible guess I was thinking in terms of functions in terms of Transformations invertibility means that you can go back means that you can apply the function from to get from X to Y then, you know how to get back from y 2x. It's an invertible function invertible linear transformation.  Okay, so I'm I'm not going to linger on this slide because it just says one more time. I'm just writing things over and over you can look at this again using slightly different words all of the different conditions that mean the same thing here. Okay. That's an a square Matrix is invertible. Meaning that it has all columns and all rows pivotal meaning that there are n pivots and leading countries in the registration form. Meaning that it's reduced row Echelon form is the identity Matrix meaning that it has both the left and a right inverse.  And therefore the moralism. This is one of the most important theorems of Matrix algebra. If you have a square Matrix remarkably, you do only need to check if it has an inverse on one side. Cuz if it has an inverse on only one side say it has an inverse on the left like at the first example we did today that implies that Solutions are unique if they exist.  Okay, and that means that delay transformation is one to one that means that every column is pivotal. But if it's a square Matrix if every column is pivotal then every rose pivotal to and therefore it's onto and therefore it also has a right inverse. That's an important remarkable theorem that matrix multiplication does always commute in the Special K where you have the identity Matrix coming out as the product if you have square matrices.  Okay, so I have now given you basically the entire story on how to check if a matrix is invertible what it means to be invertible and so forth. Okay. What I haven't told you which is perhaps the most important part is how you find the inverse if it exists, but that part you already know believe it or not.  Okay, so not all square matrices are invertible again around besides that point.  But supposing it is invertible and we can check that using row reduction. How do we find the inverse?  Well remember what it is we're looking for. What are we looking for? We're looking for?  The Matrix C  Such that a times C is the identity.  Now, let's write that down and Matrix notation. So maybe we're looking for the Matrix cc is a matrix. It's an N by n Matrix what has an columns C1 through CNN  what we're looking for is a solution of this.  Kind of Matrix equation, but it's a multi. It's a matrix equation where the input and output are vectors there also matrices.  Some of you asked about that when we talked about Matrix equations and lecture for okay, and I said we'd get to it and here we are.  But it's really a repeat of what we've already done. Cuz let's look at what we're actually asking here. We're asking for a x c.  To equal the identity Matrix and I'll write the identity Matrix in terms of its columns. Remember that it's columns are the standard basis vectors. Those are those vectors 100.  010  eventually down two zeros are at 1  but let's remember how matrix multiplication works.  A x a matrix with columns are C1 C2. We just defined that to be the Matrix with columns. Rac1 AC to down the line.  So this is what we need. We need to solve a C1 is equal to that First Column. We need to also solve a C2 is equal to that second column. What we need to do is solve not one Matrix equation, but n Matrix equations. Okay. So let's let's solve the first one. Let's figure out how to sell. The first one was schematically what we do is  That we write down the augmented Matrix with carry it to reduced row Echelon form. Now. We know that a is invertible.  Right, that's the case were in here. And so when we carry it to register Echelon form.  The thing on the left hand side of the augmented column is going to turn into the identity Matrix. That's what it means without was equivalent to a being invertible. And the thing on the right that's going to be our desired Vector C1 the First Column of the inverse and then we do the second one.  How do we know we'll get the identity Matrix here and that will give us see to so we have to do this and times.  Well, actually that's pretty wasteful.  Because when I do the row operations that carry a E12 I see one and then I I look at the next system. I'm going to do exactly the same row operations cuz the row operations are just designed to convert a to its reduced row Echelon form.  So I'm going to be repeating myself and times. The only difference is what happens to the last factor to the be right to the so what we're going to do instead is put these all together and do row reduction in parallel.  We're going to put a on the left hand side and we're going to put the whole identity Matrix, right which is this E1 E2 E3 all together on the right. So now instead of augmenting by one column, we're going to buy all of them together and do row reduction in parallel.  And that will take us to well the identity Matrix on the left.  And a inverse on the right. That's ematrix. What should we know is we're now calling a inverse. That's how you find the inverse know if if it turns out that the thing on the left a dozen row reduced to the identity Matrix. Well, then a wasn't invertible and you're going to get garbage on the right hand side Charlie garbage, but you're going to get something that means less than you would hope on the right hand side. There's only works if you get the identity Matrix for the reduced row Echelon form on the left.  Okay, but when that happens then this is how you find the inverse and it's just doing row reduction in parallel.  I so let's talk briefly about the computational complexity of this which is a fancy way of saying how long would it take a computer to do this. We talked briefly about this earlier or leasing office hours. I did with some of you if I had just a regular old Matrix equation ax equals be so demented Matrix with one column on the right.  Addison and Biometrics the number of flops the number of floating Point operations. The computer needs to do to solve that system using row operations using the road up and I'll go over them is about two-thirds and Cubed.  so  for this system here.  How much longer does it take to do an of them all together now if I did all n separately wastefully then at the end times 2/3 M cubed or 3/8 1/3 and cute. 2/3, so that would be an x 1/3 and killed which is 1/3 and 2 the fourth. Just getting longer. But when I do it in parallel, if you work through the calculation, you see that actually only takes twice as long as it takes 2/3 and Cubed flops in order to do this. So the computer can do that pretty much just as fast. So this is just repeating what I wrote on the last slide.  How do you find the inverse of a matrix if it's going to have an inverse at all? If it's invertible? Well, you do the multi augmented Matrix a on the left, but the identity Matrix on the right and columns on the right and augmented Collins. You do row reduction to carry the left hand side to its reduced row Echelon form, which is the identity Matrix invertible. And the thing you get on the right hand side. That is the inverse Matrix. So let's finish the lecture here by doing that in one special case and one example, so here's a matrix the one we had on the 4th slide.  And I'm going to compute its inverse. I had picked its inverse out of thin air to show you that it's an inverse before let's figure out how I got there.  Okay, so what we're supposed to do.  Is take the Matrix itself on the left and add the identity Matrix as an augmented Matrix on the right and now we do row reduction. So the first step of Road auction I'm going to do I want to get rid of the one below the leading one in the first row. Guess I'm going to subtract the second row of the first row from the second. So - Row 2 + Row 1 results in Row 2  But I have to do that to the whole Matrix K2 everything including both columns, and they have mental part.  So that's going to give me  the desired 0 there is one there a minus one there and nothing happens there.  Okay, and now only one more step is needed.  Now I need to subtract the pussy that I think so.  On the second row. Sorry.  are subtracting  Oh, I'm sorry. I am.  I wrote the wrong thing. What I did was I subtracted Row 1 from Row 2 in order to make this work, right? So I subtract and so I have to subtract to get zero I get one down below and I get my last one. That's what I wrote. I think this is correct. I just wrote wrote the wrong operation, but did the right operation. Thank you. Now. I'm going to subtract the second row.  From the first but the result in the first row and first row, so that's going to give me my desired 0 there.  And what happens so I subtract -1 from 1 and I get to there and I subtract -1 from 0 and I get one there.  Okay. Now I've carried the left hand side to reduced row Echelon form and the right hand side is supposed to be the inverse.  Should be a negative one on it. Where?  Out here at that.  Cuz I subtracted the second row from the first.  Okay, now that is not the Matrix that I got before so let's multiply and see what happens when maybe we're making a simple error somewhere. Let's multiply 1 1 1 2.  * 2 - 1 - 1 1  this will be where we end the lecture we get to -1 is 1 - 1 + 1 is 0  2 - 2 + 0 + -1 + 2 is one actually this is the answer we got before because we did several two by two examples and I was thinking of the wrong one. So there is the inverse Matrix. So that's how you find it and we'll talk a little more on Monday about what that means have a nice weekend and watch for that email from gradescope detailing the grades and what they mean.
