  "Full Transcript": "Do I listen to a podcast? We've had a lot of traffic on Piazza already which is great some with administrative matters some with actual course content and homework questions guys are using it just the way it's intended to be used. Please continue. If you are enrolled in the class, you're already on Piazza. If you are on the waitlist, then you haven't been automatically enrolled in Piazza, but you can enroll yourself using the link that's on the course webpage, please go ahead and do that. It's a great resource. I see that many of you have started working on the MyMathLab homework. That's great. And if you have not you should start as soon as possible. I think a few people although is largely and other lecturers have had a bit of an issue technical issues with the system trying to get logged in if you are having problems go ahead and post on Piazza and we can try to help but largely your best bet is to go directly to the technical help page for Pearson and they can help you out usually but most of the time this has been working pretty smoothly so I would like to get started pretty quickly here over there is one more thing. I wanted to mention which I posted on the course webpage. So unfortunately there was a decoding error last time and the video feed did not get recorded. So you will not be able to watch Monday's lecture. You can still hear it the podcast if there was one lecture where the video was going to fail. The first one is the right one since more than half of it was spent just going through the course webpage, which you can see anyway, so hopefully address the problem and will see today if the lecture is screencast. I hope that it will be for you. But as usual I have posted the skeleton of the notes today already on the course webpage last night and I will post the complete lecture when we're done later this afternoon, so you can use those resources as well when you're reviewing what we do today. Now I'd like to get started. So today we're going to be talking about section 1.2 topic, which is row reduction and row Echelon form or forms the next day. We'll move on to section 1.3 which is vector equation and just again as a reminder your first two MyMathLab homework sets are do not this coming Monday, but the following Monday, January 22nd at 11:15 by 11:59 p.m. And your first met love homework assignment is due next Friday, January 19th. So let's get going.  So we'll continue where we left off last day. We're talking about solving systems of linear equations. And yesterday we focused for most of the lecture that we were working on it on two equations in two unknowns, which is simple enough situation that you don't need any tools. You can just sort of do it with elbow grease you can do it by hand without worrying too much and no matter how you doing. It's going to work out. Okay, as long as you're careful enough, but already if you have three equations starts to get pretty tough to randomly get the algorithm, right? So as I mentioned the back substitution method, well, if you're careful about it will always work is typically not the way to go with larger systems the better way which is to use arithmetic operations on the equations and add and subtract multiples of the equations from each other to simplify them.  But you can't just do that run until you have to do it with purpose. You have to figure out what should I add in subtract in order to simplify these things and what does it mean to simplify them? So the operation that we did last day was to say, alright, let's take  this first equation  And the third equation, let's look at those two right now.  And let's decide to add.  Or I should say to add -5.  Time is the first equation.  To the third equation and the replace the third equation with that new equation. Okay, we're adding and subtracting multiples of equations to each other the equality signs are all staying.  Valid so what do we do this? We're not going to change the solution set in what we're interested in is finding the solution set. And the reason that I'm multiplying that first one up there by -5 is because when I do so I'm going to go to -5 x 1 + 5x one and those two are going to cancel each other. So when I when I do that, let me maybe all up for the for the moment actually write that first one x - 5 over here, so it becomes -5 x 1  + 10 x 2  i - 5 x 3 equals 0  and when I add that to the third equation  the minus 5x one canceled the 5x one.  Giving me a zero there and then I get a 10 x 2 when there was no Xtube. There was a 0x to before so I get + 10 x 2 and I have - 5 x 3 - 5 x 3. So again - 10 x 3 equals 0 + 10 equation with this new one down there now.  It's debatable whether the one that I've written there is any simpler than what I had before it's still an equation for two of the unknowns that have an isolated and equations yet. But now I've got the bottom two equations 2 x 2 - 8 x 3 equals 8 + 10 x 2 - 10 x 3 equals 10 those two equations if I ignore the first one those are two equations for the two unknowns X2 and X3 so I could do what I did last day and saw those two and find the solution or Solutions or find that there is no solution those options for those two equations and then back substitute into the first one to find the value of x.  No, I'm not going to I'm not going to do that here. I mean I am going to do it in a moment, but I'm going to first streamline the process that we just went through because it took a whole bunch of writing to do that writing that we don't need to do we can be more efficient about this and say look, there's just no reason to keep writing X1 X2 X3 equals Sun. We can keep those in our mind the arithmetic operations we needed to do I can just do on the coefficients. So I'm going to distill the system of equations into a new representative form here called an augmented Matrix.  Okay, and all that is is I take the coefficient of the variable that's one X2 and X3 and put those in this Square array of numbers down here. If I don't see a coffee shop that means of zero course and then on the right hand side of that vertical dashed line. I put the numbers that are on the right hand side of the equation. So the square Matrix and it's Square because it's 3 equations in three unknown same number of equations is unknown. I could have 7 equations and 76 unknowns and that would not be a square. It would be a tall skinny rectangle.  We won't do such an example in this room that would take a while, but you can certainly have it. So that square Matrix there to the left of the dash line is sometimes called the coefficient Matrix of the system. And the whole thing together is the augmented Matrix question.  No, that's a great question. So I'm drawing the dust line because that's the way I learned it when I took this class a little while ago and and I like the reminder that your textbook doesn't draw the line there when you are presented with a matrix and told it is the augmented Matrix you always assume that the right-hand column is the stuff that's on the right of the equal sign that you don't it's not like those kid in the zeros the. Column always represents what's on the right hand side of the equal sign. Thanks.  Okay, so let me redo the same calculation we just did.  Above butt on The Matrix cake. That's what we're going to be doing here. So I'm going to replace this Matrix with a new one.  And doing the exact same operation but instead of equations, we now have Rose. Okay, so I'm going to call these Row 1 Row 2 and Row 3 and what what we did was we took -5 * Row one. We added it to Row 3 and put that results in the third row position and didn't change anything else so we carry forward.  the same coefficients  in the first two rows  and then in the third row, we do the same operation - 5 * 1 + 5 is 0 - 5 x - 2 + 0 is + 10 + -5 - 5 is -10  + 0 + 10  okay, so it's exact same calculation.  Just less writing.  And now I'm going to keep going. Okay. So my ultimate goal is to solve the system or figure out if it has a unique solution or if it has if in the many solutions or if it doesn't it or if it's inconsistent, those are my options. And now I'm going to do exactly what I just said. I'm going to say oh, well, I recognized in the First Column of this the second or third row. Is there zeros in the First Column there which means that X1 has been eliminated from those two equation. And now I'm just going to treat it as if it were a system of two equations in two unknowns for now down there and do what I did last night. But again, the better consistent efficient thing to do is not the back substitution method is to continue with these row operations are so now what I'm going to do a taxi, there's a bunch of things I could do.  Okay, I could say well actually let's simplify these let's go ahead and do the following operation. I could say look. How about I divide through the second row by 2.  I could have done that to start up there. I could have said well that second equation 2 x 2 minutes 8 x 3 equals 8 really would be simpler if I divided through by 2 and I get x 2 - 4 x 3 equals 4. It's the same statement with a slightly less efficient statement that there so let's let's do that. So what I'm doing is I am multiplying Row 2 by 1/2 and putting the result in Row 2.  Okay, and let me combine and not have to write too much. Let me do a similar thing at the same time to Row 3 Let's divide 3 by 10 there since everything is a multiple of 10 there. So I'll divide 403 by 10 and put the result and Rowe Street.  Okay.  That didn't simplify things too much but it's going to make the next arithmetic steps a little simpler. So I want to isolate the variables right? I want to solve for say X3 right now. I've got two strikes to an X3, but I can isolate X3 by taking some combinations of the last two rows there by taking an adding or subtracting multiples of those rows together. What should I do to the second two rows to isolate x 3  Should subtract those roads from each other and put the result in canonical you put in Row 3 we go down.  okay, so let's do that if I take  Grocery and subtract Metro to and put the results in row three zeros. There aren't going to do anything. That's one of the great things about having those Rose. They're those ones are going to cancel.  and then I have -1 - -4 is -1 + 4, which is 3  And finally, I have 1-4.  Which is -3 there.  Note to be clear. What I'm doing is I'm adding and subtracting equations. I'm not using the notation of the equations and this new system of equations that this augmented Matrix represents its equivalent to the earlier one cuz I got from the earlier one to this one by doing valid operations.  So the solution set of this system is the same as the solution set of the original one.  But this one now, well, you tell me.  I'm going to tell you that or I'm telling you that this system is now recognizably in a position where we can say, yes. This has a unique solution.  There's exactly one solution. This is so we're not telling you what it is, but I can look at that form of that Matrix and say yes, there is a unique solution. Can anyone explain to me why I can see that back row?  Okay. Yes, that's that's a good explanation. So we could do one more step during divide through Row 3 by 3 and then we would get 0-0 1-1 and what that says is that equation is not been simplified 2 x 3 equals -1 solve for x 3 and it has only one value it can take I know if we if we look up from there we back substitute. The second equation is an equation for x 2 and x 3 but now we know what X3 is that's going to be a single equation for x to we can solve for x 2 and now we know what X2 and X3 are the first equation is not an equation for X1 X2 and X3 bx22br now fixed Constance. So is a single equation for x wanted and we're done or we will be done when we get there. So if you get the Matrix to this kind of form, you know that you're going to be able to finish, you know that there is going to be a unique solution know. How could we tell that? What was it that we saw there?  What we saw is this.  But we saw is that we've got the special form here that actually is not just that it's this and this.  So the yellow is on with called the diagonal of the square Matrix and the orange stuff blow it by the way, I forgive me. I'm color-blind. If I say a color name that you didn't think was a color that was there. You're probably right and I'm wrong. So the stuff below the diagonals is all zeros are all nonzero numbers. If you ever get your coefficient Matrix to this form, you know, you're going to be able to finish that, you know, you're going to be able to solve for the bottom variable and then back substitute your way up. You don't know where the solution is yet, but you know you will be able to finish.  Okay, so we're going to get to so that's an example of an Echelon forms, very old-fashioned not in Century word Echelon form. Once you get to a form like that, if you can get your phone like that, you know, you're going to be able to solve the system. It's going to be consistent and have a unique solution.  Okay. No we can do what I just said into back substitution to fish from there or we could continue with these row operations adding and subtracting column rows from each other in order to to finish solving the system. Let's do it that way and I'm going to give myself a little more space and go over here now. So first things first, let me go ahead right there and divide True by  Three to get that one there. I know what I'm going to do is say oh, well, I'd like to get I'd like to isolate X to now a text to I've gotten the second row which has X2 and X3 in it.  But I want to get rid of the X3 part of it so I can do that by adding some multiples of those second and third rows to each other. What should I do?  Someone from this side of the room.  I want to add some multiples of Rose two and three together to get rid of the X 3 dependents in the second row.  Good, I multiply Row 4 by 303 by 4 and add that to row to put the results in road to.  So the beauty is that when I do any operations between those two rows now, it's not going to affect the first column in any way because they're zeros there.  That's what's great about the zeros and this operation. I just said which is to take four times Row 3.  Added to Row 2 and put the result in row too because there's a zero in that is two zeros Below in on the bottom row there. That's also not going to do anything up here.  Hey, but what we did was designed this so that the 4 * 1 - 4 0 so it will get a zero there.  And now we're also multiplying by 4 and adding up there and we're going to get a zero here as well.  Okay.  I now have isolated next to that equation now says X2 is equal to 0 that second row there.  And now I want to isolate X1 so I can do that by continuing with these row operations.  So I want to get rid of everything but the X1 in that first row because I want to get rid of the -2 on the one by doing these row operations.  Why can't get rid of them both simultaneously, but I've got a 1 below the -2 I can use on a better one in the third row below the one I can use so I do each of those and turn and because there's so many zeros around the other coefficients are just not going to get affected so we can do this elimination.  get up with the echelon form is good for  so what I'll do is I will subtract the third row.  from the first row  and put the result in the first row.  and when I do that  I'm going to get a zero here.  and -1 subtracted from 0 is 1  and then I'm also said there's no reason to write too much of this. I'll do it simultaneously. I'm now going to add twice the second row.  To the first row in put the result in the first row and that's going to get rid of that -2 for me.  So the second operation here is now going to get rid of that -2 for me.  It's going not going to affect that 0 over there and it's going to knock on effect this one because Row 2 had a zero there.  And now look at the form of the Matrix year.  It's 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1. So what that says is that these equations down here translating back these equations say  x 1 + 0 + 0 equals 1 x 2  is equal to 0 + x 3 is equal to -1 and now I've solved my system there is the unique solution.  Unless I made a numerical error, which is always quite possible.  Not a bad idea to go back and check your work again. Although you're also learning Matlab now, which is much better at doing these calculations. That human is the idea here is to learn how Matlock  Right, so there is a full implementation of the row reduction algorithm. So what we used  whereas I said row operations  the three kinds of row operations that we saw that we actually only saw two kinds of row operations one was to take some row.  What's a Row 1 / some nonzero number, which I'll call P and put the result back in that same row. That's one kind of operation and the other kind of operation. We saw here was to take some row. Maybe it was road to I don't know multiply it by its own number.  Add that to another row. Let's say row by Row 3 and put the results in Row 3.  So those are two kinds of row operations that are totally valid that they preserve the equalities and we use only those raw operations and converted our system to one that had the variables totally isolated and salt for  There is a third kind of row operation that we didn't use in this example, but that you do sometimes need to use to solve these equations.  And it's kind of a silly one.  Something we could have done was to say let's just swap to Rose. Maybe I'll reverse the first and second remove the second row into the first row in the first row in his second row position. All that corresponds to an original system would be to rewrite them in a different order. It shouldn't matter what order you write the equations for what their solution is, right?  And we'll see you on the next slide an example where it might be necessary to do that at least in order to follow the algorithm that we were just implementing.  All right.  So here's an example what's goes through a door at least started? So here's a system of three equations in three unknowns.  What's the first thing we should do?  someone from The Middle  Yes.  right  Stop writing X1 X2 X3 an equal sign write it as an augmented Matrix.  to save ourselves lots of trouble  Okay now.  What we did last time was to say what we'd like to do is first to figure out whether it has a solution or not is to get it into that Echelon form where we have zeros below the diagonal.  Play that's what we mean by isolating in this algorithm.  But there's a kink here, which is that there's a zero on the diagonal right now.  Is so that first if we got zeroes below the diagonal would be in trouble because then we wouldn't have X1 in the equation anymore at all. But actually what that means is that we can't get it into that form as it is right now because there's a zero there. So this is where it will be necessary to do these that the Third Kind of row operation the swap.  Okay. So let's swap two of the Rose. Let's swap the first in the second row.  And make sure to carry everything in the row when you do this. Don't move some of the numbers but not the others.  Okay, I know.  There's a nonzero entry in that on the diagonal in the first part and there's already a zero below it. So we're already in good shape. I didn't write down which row operation I used this time. I'm not always going to write the row operations. Okay, but if I'm if I do a real operation here and you didn't follow what I did, please ask me to write it down for you when you're doing this for yourself as you're practicing at the great idea to write down the row operations that you were using especially if you're going to backtrack and figure out if you made a mistake,  And backtracking is a great Point here, which is that the row operations these three row operations down here. They're all reversible. They have to be in order for this to be a valid operation.  So I could if I am home at this and swap to Rose, I could swap them back and get back to the original system. I can reverse that first operation there if I had divided Row 1 by 7, I could get back to the original row by dividing that first row by 1/7 x 7 the reversible operation and this one is also reversible. If you take that third row that you replaced by something here. You just have to subtract from it a times are too and put the result in roaster. They all three of these operations are reversible you can end that that has to be the case of to augment his messages are going to be equivalent row equivalent. They represent the same system of equations, then you have to be able to go back from the 2nd to the 1st as well.  Okay. So anyway, we've done one row operation here now. Our goal is to in the first phase of this algorithm is to get Zero's below the name that we have to get rid of this for somehow so that actually a few ways we can do that. Well actually in this case is probably only one good way to do that which is to multiply the first row by -2 and add it to the fourth row. So let's do that. So I'll leave the first two rows untouched.  And If I multiply the first row by -2 and add it to the third row that gives me my desired 0 there.  now - 2 x - 3 is 6 I add that to -8 and I get -2  and 2 * -2 is -4 out of 12 and I get 8  and 1 * -2 is -2 add that to the one down there and I get - 1  can I have zeros below that too?  Great. Now if I want to get it to that Echelon form where I have zeros all below the diagonal. There's only one more step I need to take.  I need to get rid of the minus 2 below the one there and I can do that by what what what operation should I do now?  Yes.  Multiply Row 2 x 2 and add that to the Roasterie and put the result in Roastery.  Okay, so that zero is unaffected. I multiply the one by 2 and add it to ro39 gives me the zero. I was hoping for their and I multiply that -4 by 2 and added to the eighth and that gives me 0 there. Oh, wow. I got an extra zero for fun. And I take that 8 * 2 and added to the -1 and that gives me 15.  That's interesting. So this is an Echelon form. We have zeros below the main diagonal.  But we have an extra zero here on the diagonal. What does that mean?  I left you by show of hands.  Yes, so let's think what this equation with this row represents. It represents the equation down here 0 equals 15 to 0 equal 15. No not on my watch. It doesn't. Okay. So we have arrived at a contradiction and that tells us that  There are no Solutions. This system is inconsistent.  That was easy pay the first to the way it was presented to us. At first. There's no hope of looking at it and seeing that it's inconsistent, but it just required three row operations through judicious row operations. We had to follow a particular algorithm to get there and that algorithm is something that you need to master now he but it's not hard to master. I'll give you 10 more examples and you'll be  And the great thing is here. We don't need to go any further. Right? So just like in the last example once we got to this form down here or actually even that form right there.  with the highlighting  Oh, we could tell that the system would have a unique solution when we got that we had to do a few more steps in order to find the solution, but we could figure out the status of equations when we got there and similarly in this example. There's no reason at all to go any further to do any more row operations because we've already established that there's no solution at all. So we are done with this example.  So here's let's do another question.  I'm sorry.  Yes, this Matrix is that there is in a row Echelon form and into more slides while precisely defined those ideas and you'll see what I mean. But but for now on form means a form from which you can tell the status of the equation of the solution set. Is it a unique point or is it infinitely many points or are there no Solutions. Those are always the three possibilities Echelon form is one from which you can look at it and say, oh, I know the answer to that question.  question  exactly. Well, we wouldn't be able to establish that is inconsistent. Then I mean it could then be that the second row would after further operations say 0 equals 38, but that's a great example and break point here if it had turned out.  That the The Matrix we got here was this instead?  Then we could also conclude something and in this form we can we can conclude the full statement.  Which is the third equation there actually was extraneous it carried no information. It was a consequence of the other two because it reduces just 0 equal 0 and instead what we get is two equations in three unknowns and the Matrix is still in Echelon form.  So we have nonzero. Oops. We have nonzero entries here.  Okay, so that those two equations say the second one says x 2 - x 4 equals 8 and the first one says 2 x 1 - 3 x 2 + 2 2 x 3 equals one, we could simplify things a little Beyond there and we'll get to that in a few minutes but fundamentally what it says is there isn't enough information to solve the system completely. In other words. There isn't a unique solution there will be infinitely many solutions. So if you get to the point where one of your equation says 0 equal 0 and the rest of them are in Echelon form without a 0 on the diagonal then you can stop you can stop when you're answering the question of what is the status of the solution set and conclude there are infinitely many solutions.  Then there was one more question down here before or has it already been answered.  Has been answered.  All right. Great. Maybe I should write down what I just said. It has infinitely many solutions.  Okay, so here's an example which is similar a couple of examples which are similar to things that you see on your homework. So here's a matrix of equations example there.  Tell me if this system is consistent or not. Let's take a boat. Actually how many people think that system is consistent?  Okay, do you view how many people think it's inconsistent?  Slightly more of you how many people have no idea what's going on?  Thank you for your honesty, sir.  All right. Well, so let's let's look at this together. So in this case there were most of you didn't come out to vote. That's bad. You should come out and exercise your right to vote whether you're right or not slightly more of you thought that the system is inconsistent and consistent okay with anyone who voted for consistent like to explain why they said it was consistent. Yes.  Exactly. So we've gotten this into an Echelon form and there are nonzero entries on the diagonal which means you can start at the bottom solve for x 3 and back substitute your way up just like in the first example we did today. So in this case democracy failed the answer is that this is a consistent system, but please do vote was whether you whether you were right this time or not. Please do vote next time.  I said yeah, that's the key here once you get a matrix in this form.  Where are zeros below that diagonal and you have nonzero entries on the diagonal you can immediately say aha. This system is consistent. I know there will be a solution that in fact, I know there'll be a unique solution.  All right, and if you wanted to find that solution you need to do a few more steps of row reduction to eliminate the coefficients above the diagonal as well. And then you'll have isolated the variable.  Alright, here's another example, which is similar to problems that you'll see on the hobo question back there.  Well 5 dozen equal 0 but that's not what that 30 equation there says. We have to remember how we did the translation.  that equation says 5 x 3 equals 0  the the problem would have been if it were at 0 and 5.  So the order of the call was matters. Thank you very much for pointing that out because you just explained why many people probably thought this was inconsistent and I'm going to pretend that I put this example there exactly to elicit that thought because I'm sure many people were thinking the same thing. Okay, but that's a great example to understand how you need to master the translation here. Remember what it actually said, so it's true that the equations 5 equals 0 + 0 equals 5 say the same thing, but when you're doing the translation from the augmented Matrix to the system of equations, the order of the columns Matt, the last column has a different meaning than the other columns, which is why I like to put that dotted line there to remind myself of that fact.  Was there another hand I think I saw another had yes.  No consistent just reminder from last day consistent means there is at least one solution to a system is consistent means there might be one solution or there might be infinitely many solutions inconsistent means there's no solution at all. You're right that we actually have more information here. In this case. We have yes, it is consistent and the solution is unique.  All right. So let's look at this next example here which is similar to one that's on your homework for this week.  So here I have a system of equations 2 equations in two unknowns, depending how you look at it actually looks like you might have two equations in for on noses for variables their X1 X2 H&K, but don't think of H&K as variables think of them as numbers. I just haven't told you what those numbers are. Okay, so they might be three and seven is just a system of two equations in two unknowns and here are two questions about that system for which values of H&K is the system consistent. So they'll be some H&K for which there is a solution or many many or maybe many solutions.  Find the which characterize which H&K have that property and secondly it if there are any H&K for which is consistent. Are there any for which there is a unique solution some of those H&K. Maybe they'll be a unique solution.  So, how are we going to answer this question?  All right. Well, let me let me explain to you the answer to every question in. This course is the same row reduction with me now. How are we going to answer this question?  Okay, not bad about the end of the quarter. I wanted to be much more enthusiastic.  So we're going to proceed to try to solve the system. Now. There's an unknown numbers H&K over there. So we need to be careful with arithmetic operations, but the idea is exactly the same.  We write down the augmented Matrix for the system. It's 2-1 and H and it's -6 3K.  And now we want to use row operations to carry this to an Echelon form, which means we want to eliminate for example to the -6 in the lower left-hand corner so we can do that.  by multiplying the first row by  3 so I'll write the operation in this case. So I'm up by the first row by three added to the second row and put the result in the second row. So that doesn't touch the first row.  and then in the second row I get  By Design a zero there now if I multiply -1 by 3 and add it to 3. I also get a zero and I have to be careful about the rightmost column.  It's what I've done is to multiply the first row by 3. So that's three h and add it to the second row so I get three h + K.  and now  I contend that I can completely answer both questions just by looking at that because this Matrix is in Echelon form. That's a great is an Echelon form. That's a great thing about two by two systems. You can always get it to an actual form with one step. That's what we just did zero zero below the diagonals 2 1/0 at second 0 there is very telling so in the spirit of the last question that was asked about the previous example, let's rewrite the equation that that third row for that second row represents. This says 0 x 1 + 0 x 2 is equal to 3 H + K.  Is that equation true?  I heard up a plethora of different answers there. So maybe like to vote again. Is that equation true?  Yes, I heard see if you ask. How about how about no is that equation false?  Okay. So now we have to have a deep philosophical discussion about the notion of Truth. Okay, so maybe maybe I'll be more precise. Is that equation always true?  I know there are some H&K for which is true and some H&K for which is false and that is exactly the dichotomy that gives us the answer that question up there. So if  3 H + k equals 0  Then the system.  is consistent  because that second equation just says 0 equal 0 in that case and the first equation says to X1 - X2 equals H, which is the equation of a line. So there are lots of solutions is consistent and has infinitely many solutions.  If 3 H + K is not equal to zero.  Then the system.  is  inconsistent  because that equation says 0 equals 43 or whatever number it straight with K is which I've decided is not zero in that case.  So now looking back the original question for which H&K is the system consistent. The answer is the exact description of those H&K are the set of all H&K for which three h + k + 0 for example H equals 1 + k equals -3 is an example of a pair H&K for which the system has a solution and affected as infinitely many solutions.  H&K bolt equal to one is an example where there are no Solutions  okay so the answer that first question is  that this is consistent if and only if this term it is a shortened form of F and only if this happens exactly when three h + k equals 0  now what about the second one for which H&K is there a unique solution  Anyone have an idea for which H&K is there a unique solution?  There ain't no H&K switch. There's a unique solution exactly because we've just established the dichotomy down here either 3 equals 0 in which case there are infinitely many solutions or 3 + K is non-zero in which case there are no Solutions. There's no room in the middle for there to be a unique solution.  Yes.  Well in this case.  There aren't enough equations to pin down a single solution at the end of the day. We're left with the equation 2x 1 - x 2 equals H. And that is the equation of a line that there are infinitely many points on a line. There's no further information. So there are infinitely many solutions to answer your question why generality let's turn to the next slide where we finally will get to this notion of echelon form more precisely defined and we can answer exactly when you can tell once you get your Matrix into Echelon form. Okay. So here are two examples at the top there actually related to examples that we that we already saw it took office in matrices these two matrices here at the top are in Echelon form, and I wanted to just first specify some language.  Okay that will use in describing what Exelon form means. So whenever you have any Matrix at all, you can talk about the leading and trees in each row. So in in the first example here, I'm going to highlight the leading entries.  And I'm going to do so over here as well.  So those are the leading entries. So that is to say you look at each row of your Matrix at any given stage when you drink operation. So you look at it a coefficient Matrix.  Deleting entries are the first non-zero entry in each row. So in the first row, the first non-zero entry is the two right there in the one 1 entry then the second row the first ones are interested to two entry. And in the third row on that first example, their first nuns are entries actually in the rightmost column, and we've already seen by the way if this is the Matrix The Matrix of a system of equations, then that third row represents the equation 0 equals 5/2, which is an inconsistent equation so we can tell there are no Solutions there. So that's him that's another case where we need to keep track of what's on the left vs. Right of that dotted line on the right hand side. The leading entries are all on that main diagonal there.  Okay, so that's what leading entry means the first non Zero Entry in a given row is the leading entry in that row.  So here is what a row Echelon form means a matrix square or rectangular.  Is in row Echelon form if it looks like this that is to say what I've done is put a little green boxes in the leading entries of this Matrix is leading in the first non-zero in Chinese row. So everything to the left of each of those boxed leading countries is zero.  I noticed that in this case here.  Every entry below a leading entry is 0 so that's the lower triangular part that I was talking about that has to be zero to be an Echelon form. Now lower triangular Parts only makes sense for a square Matrix cuz the stuff below the leading actresses in the Triangle here, but this is the generalization that you can always get to that. A matrix is said to be in row Echelon form. If everything below a leading entry is 0  And that's exactly what you can do with row operations. You can always use row operations to get zeros below leading entry by multiplying the row with that leading entry by appropriate constants and adding it to the things below to cancel out the things in that row below it step-by-step.  Green asterisk. They're just represent any numbers at all. They could be zero or they could be nonzero are they we don't care what they are as long as they are to the right row Echelon form if you have zeros below the leading actress.  And once you have a matrix in a row Echelon form, that's a row Echelon form because I don't care what the leading entries are. They just have to be nonzero. They might be 7pi 28. So they're different different row Echelon form is depending on what those constants are.  But once you're in a row Echelon form, you can figure out whether the system has one solution infinitely many solutions or no Solutions.  Because in this example here we have in row Echelon form at the bottom with God's.  Exkash how many zeros are the x 7 plus something * x 8 plus something * x 9 equals something. It's possible those some of those some things are zero. We might have isolated X7 there but there's just no way we're going to be able to isolate x 8 and x 9. There's no leading entries corresponding to x 18 x 9. There's also no leading entry bindings X3. If you look at the third column, there were X3 would be there's no leading entry for X3. So we're not going to be able to isolate it no matter how hard we try.  So in this case, there's no way we're going to have a unique solution and also because I've told you there's a leading entry in the last column there and it's not, you know in the right color in the last row there and it's not in the right column. We never see the equation 0 equals 15 coming up. There's no inconsistency so we can look at this form here and say of this system represents equations that have infinitely many solutions.  Once we get to a row Echelon form, we can answer the question of the status of the solution set but we can't tell you what the solution is necessarily we have to go a little further than that. So that's what reduced row Echelon form is about. So let me show you what that is.  reduced row Echelon form would be if we get it now by 5 dividing through  we can always make those leading entries ones.  And when they're ones something else we can do is we can now use those to do the backward phase of the algorithm like we did in the two examples in the first example, and now during operations to get zeros above the leading actress.  This Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form.  Where there are no nonzero entries other than the leading ones in the columns in which the leading ones up here. So reduced row Echelon form in the leading entry in each row is a one and it's the only non Zero Entry in its column.  And in this one we can now say what the solution or solution set is I have reduced it to the simplest form possible now will get into MIT examples like this in the next days, but let's just ignore the columns that are there that have no leading entries if this had been that's the lecture isn't quite done yet. So, please people are trying to listen.  If there are If This Were a diagonal like the examples that we saw that we would have isolated all the variables in there be a unique solution now if it's not of that form like this and we have some variables that haven't been isolated and can't be isolated. Then we're not going to have a unique solution. We're going to have infinitely many solutions, but we're going to be able to describe it. Okay. So let me go to the last slide here and just give you a couple more words as we finish here. So the here's an example of a matrix that is in reduced row Echelon form. Okay, if you look at the leading and trees are here here and here.  It's in reduced row Echelon form because there are no nonzero entries in those column zeros above and below those wants.  And I can now tell what the complete solution of this looks like that is the system of equations if I rewrite it for that Matrix looks like that over there on the right and that's as simple as it yet. So we have actually isolated X5 there but there's no way we can isolate x 3 x 4 and x 2 and x one from each other. They just satisfy these reduced equations. And that's all we can say the set of solutions is the solutions of those reduced equations and there infinitely many such Solutions. So the the variables that correspond to the leading ones that is X1 X2 + x 5 those are called pivotal variables. Those are the ones that you can sort of isolate and then the remaining variables that you just can't isolator called free variables. You can't pin down their value even in terms of other things. Those are the free variables there. They can roam freely through space and they determine the other  Variables and that's how you get infinitely many solutions you get a parametrization of a line or a plane or something like that the describes the solution set. All right, so we will continue with special on forms and a  UC San Diego ",
