If you believe that you deserve every great you need to contact your ta and arrange to meet with them probably during either section or office hours this week before Friday afternoon and write out a careful explanation of why does you think that you deserve more points on a particular problem and then you will discuss it with them and take it from there. That's the procedure for requesting a regrade. All right. Today we are going to continue with Section 4.1 Vector spaces and subspaces and then proceeded to section 4.2 which will relate these new fancy words with things that you've already been doing all quarter. Okay, so it's going to make it much more concrete. So will understand both what these new things Vector spaces and subspaces are about and it will give new insight into the stuff that we've been doing in terms of solving linear equation since the beginning. And then next time on Friday, we will move onto linear Independence sets and basis of vector spaces that section 4.3.  Okay, so just to review a little bit the beginning here last day. We introduced this new technical notion Vector space a vector space is a set of objects V.  Hang together with a special element we call 00 vector and equipped with two operations vector addition and scalar multiplication.  That combine elements of that set in in a ways together that follow the rules of addition and scalar multiplication. We are used to from grad school elementary high school mathematics. Okay as we've been working through here.  That is when you can just take any set and make this work, right? So could you have a vector space that has only two elements in it? No, that's not possible. Because if you have a vector in the space some Vector, I mean I'm thinking of it as an arrow like my arm pointing out here. But if you have some nonzero Vector in the space, you have to be able to scale it by real numbers. That's part of the conditions here. Thus it has to be closed under scalar multiplication. So if I can take that vector and scale it then that one vector scales up by all real numbers to infinitely many different factors such as soon as you have at least one nonzero Vector in your space. It must be infinite in size. Okay must go on maybe not in all directions, but it must go on it and it infinitely far in the directions that you have.  Now one exceptional case here is if the vector space consists of just the zero Vector that's possible. That is a vector space. That is what one of my University professors would have called the stupidest example, you could just have the zero vector and that satisfies all the axioms stupidly of a vector space you can't do much with it, but it is a vector space. Okay, so we did some examples last day was RN is a vector spaces the one we've been working with all along or the ones for different ends. And then we saw some more abstract examples last day like the space of all polynomials that is a vector space. You can add polynomials together multiply them and there is a zero polynomial in those things interact the way they're supposed to do for vector addition and scalar multiplication. Whereas the set of polynomials of degree exactly equal to 3 was not a vector space because that set was not closed under addition. For example, we saw an example of two.  Degree, 3 polynomial is whose sum was not degree 3 it was degree to so that set was not closed under the vector operations for the set of polynomials of degree at most 3 Palms of degree 0 1 2 and 3. That is a vector space. Let's look at another example today.  The set of 2 by 3 matrices cuz I'm going to use this notation your textbook use is it from now on I'm sub P by Q means the set of matrices with P Rosen Q columns.  No, we are we've been working with matrices since the first lecture in this class, but we've been thinking about them as the coefficients of a system of linear equations or more recently as kind of algebraic objects that we can multiply together and maybe they have inverses sometimes that sort of thing.  But now I want to think about them differently again. I'm going to take about these matrices not as things that I multiply vectors by I want to think about the matrices as vectors themselves. So different perspective. These matrices are going to be the vectors in this space. So if it's going to be a vector space, all I need to do is tell you what's the zero Vector, how do I add two vectors? And how do I scale a X Factor by any real number and then verify that all of those operations satisfy all the rules that they're supposed to satisfy, but we already know how to add matrices together, right? I did that three lectures ago or for lectures ago. So let's in the stew by 3 case.  The Matrix looks like a 1/8 there. Let's call it a 1 b 1 c 1  D1 E1 F1 and here's another one A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2. So there's two sort of arbitrary.  2 by 3 matrices, I don't need to tell you how to add them. And I also need to tell you how to scale or multiply one of them. Let's actually do those two at the same time. I'm going to tell you how to steal a multiply the first one and add it to the second one and one shot. That'll tell me the rules for doing both.  Hey, but we know how that works. We have to scale.  All the entries of the first Matrix and add those to the corresponding entries of the second Matrix.  Find a D1 + D2.  E1 E2 and Lambda F1 + F2 so there is my rule. That's how we scalar multiply and add matrices. We knew this already and there is a zero Matrix and we highlighted the fact that it satisfies the property that zero Matrix has to have that if you add the zero Matrix of the appropriate size to any Matrix you get that Matrix back. That's the Axiom. That's the rule that 0 vectors have to satisfy. So it's now a laborious but routine thing to check that this definition for addition and scalar multiplication. It satisfies all the rules that has to satisfy making the space of 2 by 3 matrices into a vector space the space of 76 by 321 and matrices is a vector space in the same way, but the set of all matrices is not a vector space.  Why?  In order for something to be a vector space you have to be able to add any two things together.  Okay, if I give you a 2 by 3 Matrix and a 7 by 8 Matrix, can I add them together? And so there's no natural way to add those two together. So that's space that set of all matrices is not a vector space but the set of  Zach of matrices of a fixed size is always a better space so we can think of the matrices as vectors in the right context. Here's another example, let's look at the line.  which is this line here at the set of all scalar multiples of the vector 1 2  I said this is a line in the planets draw a picture of it.  And so that means it's a line of slope to here.  Like that, it's that line what I mean is it's all vectors along that line. So let's draw the vectors in Black. So here is one vector in that line. And here's another Vector in that line. Here's another one and another one and so on all of those are points in this space. All those are vectors in this Vector space if I want to verify that it's a vector space. I need to tell you how to add things and how to scare multiply them. Well,  We know how to do that already because these are vectors these are vectors in R2, but it's not all of the actors in our two. That's okay. I already have an addition Rule and a scalar multiplication rule. So if I take two of them, let's say  s x 1/2 that's one element of the fln another element t x 1/2 and I add them together. What I get is of course s + t x 1/2 and that is  want to and that is again back on the same line. That's just saying that if I take these two parallel vectors in that direction, I had them up I get a new Vector in that same direction.  Okay, I'm similarly if I scale a vector up. It's in that line. You can see from the picture that stays in the line of course and the last most important thing here. Is that the line passes through 0 so there are lines in the plane that don't pass through 0 that kind of line cannot be as a vector space because it doesn't contain the zero vector vector spaces have to have the zero Vector a line through the origin in RN that is an example of a vector space.  All right. So actually that last example is a special kind of vector space. Well sort of it's it's really an easier kind to deal with because it was a vector space but it was already in a bigger Vector space that we understand rights of the vector spaces. We've been working with since the very beginning or in  those we understand pretty well and that last example the line was a subset of RN but not any old subset. It was a subset that itself was a vector space under the same Vector operations that are Anna's a vector space with respect to and that kind of vector space is going to be play critical role for us for the rest of the quarter. So here it has a special name. We call it a Subspace.  This is a word by the way that if your science-fiction fan years these words are probably sounding like things that you hear on in science fiction shows all the time, but they have specific mathematical meaning and I guarantee you the words were used in linear algebra long before they were imported into Star Trek him and another places. I like those shows too, but we're not going to be rocking. We're not going to be blowing your mind with any kind of sci-fi today. Well, I think so you start with a vector space to be like RN or maybe like the space of all polynomials so some Vector space.  Are you look at a subset of that to a collection of objects in there, but maybe not the whole thing that symbol there that symbol with the like a c with a line under it in case you aren't familiar with it. We pronounce that is a subset of that symbol there. It's a w is a subset of the the line underneath means that it's a subset but it might actually be the whole thing. Right like this table is a subset of itself kind of silly thing to say, but it is so that line means is contained in or is equal to was another way you could pronounce that. So if I start with an asset  Inside a bigger Vector space we call it a Subspace if it is closed under the vector operations.  What does that mean exactly what let's let's clarify. The first things first. There is an important word here nonempty. The empty set is a trip is is at a stupid example of a subset of every set the set the contains nothing, but that's not a vector space. Why is the empty set? Not a vector space?  This is a kind of a tricky question, but there is a definite answer based on the definition.  Any thoughts. Yes.  It doesn't still have a direction. Okay. Well every every Vector in the empty set has a direction which is that that statement is true, even though there's no vectors in there. Right? Like the current King of France is bald is a true statement because there is no king of France.  That's good that you're thinking that way but let's let's see if we can focus in precisely. So the issue is that there is one of the axioms of a vector space where there's an existential demand. There's some particular Vector that's always in the vector space. What is it the zero Vector the emptiness that doesn't contain a zero vector and therefore it's not a vector space. So you have to start with a nonempty set has to contain and then most importantly the subset it has to be closed under the vector operations. So that means  it has to be closed under addition and scalar multiplication must be the case that  if I take two vectors u and v that are in the Big vectorspace W, but are actually in the little vectorspace the little the little set W, which is a subset of B.  then the sum  well those two vectors u and v there in this big Vector space RN.  And so there's some is in RM cuz I ran as a vector space but they're also in this Subspace the line of slope 2 in the plane.  So the sum of those two vectors, I know that it's in our too. But in order for that line to be a Subspace, it must be that that sum of the two vectors is back in the Subspace.  Not just Envy.  But actually in this subset examples to home, but that's the critical thing though. It's a subset operations so similar.  If Lambda is a real number.  And V is a vector. Maybe it will cod WW2 as a vector in this subset. W.  Then all skill are multiples of that are back in W. Not just Envy we knew it was Envy already because V is closed under the vector operations, but it's critical that it's actually closed.  It's actually in the subset W. And then the third we don't need that third statement explicitly because we assume that W is a nonempty subset and it's closed under scalar multiplication. So if it contains anyone Vector, let's call that Vector Alice then Alice * 0 is  Any Vector times 0 is 0 so as soon as you have one vector, if you know, you're a Subspace, you must have the zero Vector as well, but it's not doesn't hurt just ate explicitly that 0 was in there. So for example, as I said on the left slide the zero Subspace is always a Subspace if I give you any better space the Subspace consisting of just the zero Vector is a Subspace. It is Trivial a closed-end of the vector operations. If I take any two zeros will is only one of them their sum is zero if I take any Vector zero and scaling X any number I get zero it's closed under this under the vector operations. So you always have that Subspace around but usually you'll have more interesting ones if the vector space itself isn't the zero Vector space.  Turn up the Subspace. It's a subset of a vector space that is a vector space in its own right under the same Vector operations and the image we should have is all of the kind of things that we've been working with already geometrically where the space is the space R3 maybe and the Subspace is a line passing through the origin in R3 or a plane passing through my two arms. The origin is here in my torso. Okay, so that the plane passes through the origin. Those are the geometric ideas. You should have in mind when you think Subspace like a lion or a plane in R3 those are subspaces as long as they pass through the origin.  This is the kind of language. We're going to use to describe.  76 dimensional subspaces of 324 dimensional space that we can visualize but can use the mathematics here to describe just as well question.  Is a little nectar what story?  The question is is the Little W another vector, and yes, I'm saying if I take any real number and any Vector that happens to be in the subset W, and I've called it a little W. Maybe that was a mistake to use W2 mean both of those things. So I'll try to take wnw  But maybe we'll try to use different letters to to make that clear in the future. All right, so that's a Subspace. So let's look at some examples.  Here's a great example the first one there.  Sonr 3. This is just the kind that I was talking about. I'm going to go with my arms in our three here is a subset of the set of all vectors.  Of the form x y 0 third component is 0 that's not all vectors in R3 geometrically. It's easy to describe. Okay. It is the XY plane in XYZ space that are only in the xy-plane that don't have any Z components. That is a Subspace.  Why is it a Subspace what we can in order to verify that it's a Subspace? We just need to check three things or maybe just two things if we know it's not have to check that. It's closed under addition and under scalar multiplication. So let me just do the scalar multiplication one here, for example, so if I take any Vector x y 0 and Ice Killer X some real number Lambda the definition is that that's equal to Lambda Lambda y 0 which is again an element of ww.w is defined to be those vectors Whos the composer is 0  Start component of zero and if I scalar multiply one of those vectors by any number I get a vector is there composer has zero so that set is closed under scalar multiplication a very similar argument will show you that it's closed under addition and the zero Vector is in there, right? Because zero X as X and Y both being zero is allowed in that definition.  I know this might look a lot like what we had to do to verify that.  General abstract things were Vector spaces in the last lecture, but the reason is because we weren't actually going through the whole verification of something you need a vector space before remember there were those 16 conditions on page 192 of your textbook it safe for this thing to be a vector space. You need to Define an addition on a scalar multiplication unspecified zero vector and verify that all those things satisfy all of these properties like the associativity and commutative addition of the distributive Ade of scalar multiplication over addition and all the different ways. Those things are stated. The beauty of a Subspace is I don't need to verify any of those things because I already know that the big Vector space in this case are three satisfies them. So all I need to do is check that the subset I'm interested in is closed under the two operations and contains the zero Vector which are typically easy things to verify.  And then I will automatically know that all of those 16 conditions hold for the Subspace because they hold for the general operations on the whole Vector space.  So the moral of the story is it's much easier to check something as a Subspace than that. It's an abstract Vector space on its own.  Another example, I didn't write down here but pursuant to last days lecture. We saw that the space the set of all polynomials is a vector space and we also saw that the set of all polynomials of degree at most 3 is a vector space actually that second one with polynomials of degree at most three piece of 3, that is a Subspace of the space of all polynomials subset and it's a vector space in its own right if I add up two polynomials of degree at most 3 there do the song has degree at most three multiplication and the zero Vector zero polynomial has degree Atmos.  Okay. How about this one here. I'm calling it a so this is the set of vectors in three dimensional space of the form XY 1  is that a Subspace or not? I'm going to give you 15 seconds talk to your neighbor and then we'll take a vote go.  Alright, let's see what we think how many people think that is a Subspace.  1 1/2 people how many people think that is not a Subspace.  Lot of very confident people. That's great with somebody would just raise their hand the second time like to explain why they voted that way.  Yes.  It doesn't contain the zero Vector. Perfect. That's one way to see it. The zero Vector is not in there. The zero Vector has third component equal to zero and every Vector in a has their component equal to one. So it's not a Subspace because it doesn't contain the zero Vector now you might wonder okay, but there were three conditions. Maybe it's not as bad as the other ones but it's not so hard to see that that's impossible. If you don't contain the zero Vector then you also must fail both of the other tests as well. For example, if I took two vectors in here to arbitrate vectors in here X1. Y1, 1 + X2 Y2 to at y21, right those are too arbitrary vectors in there and I add them up when I get is X1 + y 1  That's right X1 + X2. Y1. + Y2 + 1 + 1 which is too so this thing is not back in a the sum of any two of these things is not in that thing. It's the sir the maximally failing that condition no matter which ones you choose the sum will never be back in there.  Say muscular multiplying you can't scale X anything other than one and stay in there. So that thing is not a Subspace. It is a translation of a Subspace it is what you get if you take everything in the Subspace w.  And add to them the vector zero zero one. So you shift everything in W by the vector zero zero one that should look familiar thinking back to lecture three or four of this class when we talked about system is a solution sets of homogeneous systems versus in homogeneous systems. We saw that the solution set of a homogeneous system of equations always contains. The zero Vector was an in homogeneous system of the same coefficient Matrix, doesn't it may may have no solution. But if it does it won't contain the zero Vector because 8 * 00 not whatever the bee is on the other side, but that the solution set will look like this it will look like  The homogeneous solution set which will see you in a few minutes. It's always a Subspace shifted by some particular solution.  Okay, so things like that set a there they're relevant to what we've been working on in this class, but they're not subspaces. They're slightly more General.  Okay, here's another example. Here's a set of 2 by 3 matrices subset of the set of three matrices. But only four of the components are nonzero. Not any for but particularly the one 11221 in-23 entries are nonzero and the 1/3 + 3 + 2 1 and 1/3 and 2 two entries are always zero in there. That's the that's set of matrices. Is this one question?  the symbol here  That's the symbol that I highlighted to slides ago or one side ago. It's the contained in symbol. It's that is a subset of symbol.  Thanks for pointing that out. It's a symbol that may be unfamiliar to many of your textbook uses it and so we need to add it to our lexicon of symbols that we can read.  Okay. So this is a subset of the set of 2 by 3 matrices question is is it a Subspace or not? So let's let's do it again. I'll give you guys 15 seconds take a look do some calculations talk to your neighbor and let smoke.  All right, seems like people are cutting down a bit. So let's do it again. How many people think that this is a Subspace?  Looks like most of you honey. People think it's not a Subspace.  Nobody, okay. Well democracy works it is. In fact the Subspace would someone like to explain why?  Yes.  Great. Let me repeat what you said. That's that's a great explanation. There's nothing that you could add or multiply that would change the structure of this Matrix the structure of this Matrix that has zeros in the one three and two two positions that is preserved under the vector operations. The first things first the zero Vector is in here. It's the better you get when you said a b c and d all equal to zero. So the zero Vector is in there. That is the zero Matrix is in there. Let's give this set of name. Let's let's call this thing. I don't know Bob zero is in Bob check.  And now we need to see that addition and scalar multiplication preserve the structure. So let's be pedantic about it. But the way you said it already explains how this works. So I'm going to take to arbitrate elements of this guy.  If I add them up the way I asked to add like positions components.  0 + 0 is zero there.  And that is back in Bob. Okay. So on a similar argument with scale and multiplication will show the same thing. So yes, this thing is a Subspace Bob is a Subspace.  Great.  Okay one last example. Let's take the set is a subset of the reline. It is the unit circle.  Okay, so that is the set of points on the on the unit circle. So I mean by that vectors like like this one here.  Okay, and that one over there and that one over there? Okay doctors of unit likes. Those are the vectors in this subset. What do you think? Is this a Subspace or not?  But someone like to raise hand and tell me what they think.  Yes.  Perfect. No because it can't be together X if I take any Vector in this set and a scalar multiplied by any number that is not one.  The resulting Vector is no longer in the set. So it is not closed under scalar multiplication.  Del Sol not closed under addition. Okay, if I take too arbitrary vectors of length 1 their sum is typically not of length one interesting problem for you to think about geometry problem. Are there two vectors of length one who's Sam has length 1  the answer is yes. That's that shitt infinitely many pairs, but think about this if I fix say this first standard basis Vector over there, can you find any vectors on the circle? So if I add them to that Vector I get a vector of length 1 the answer is yes, there are exactly two of them and I'm going to leave it to you to think about that if you're interested in fun puzzles like that, but typically by take give you two vectors in there almost always there song will not be back in there and the circle doesn't contain the zero vector be in the middle there. It's missing so it's definitely not a Subspace.  We could do a similar example of where we we eliminate that last problem, which was what if we did the disc, let's do that.  So the disc contained in our two and that consists of  the filled in circle. Okay, so we're allowed to have vectors that are inside as well.  So let's look at some of those.  I could have this vector.  And that Vector over there and that backed over their length less than or equal to one. So now this this disk the solid disk here. It contains the zero Vector. All right. Is that solid disk? Is it a Subspace? I see you shaking your head. No, would you like to tell me why?  It's not closed under scalar multiplication. Exactly. So if I took this Vector down here that I just drew this one here.  Hex I can scale that one a little bit I can scale it down and it'll stay in there and I can scale it up a little bit but I can scale it up also like that and then it won't be back in there. The condition for being a Subspace is that you always have to be able to scale no matter what if you ever fail to be back in the subset when you scale that means you're not a Subspace. So there are some skill in multiples of vectors in there that leak outside and therefore the disc is not a Subspace.  That's what I was saying at the beginning of the lecture. If you're going to be a Subspace, if you got to be a vector space, it's not that you have to go on and all directions necessarily ride like a plane in R3. There are some directions missing at the direction. My head is in right now, but you have to go on forever and all the directions you do go in so you can't be a nice compact set like the the disc or the circle. Those are not IV subspaces.  Okay, good. I feel like we have a good handle on this idea of Subspace. So now  let's talk about another kind of example, actually, we've already seen this example of a couple of times already hidden different ways. This is going to be the preeminent example, in fact as we'll see lecture every Subspace looks like this one and that is to say if I take an extra space any extra space as usual for intuition think about our end as your big Vector space and take any vectors any set of vectors V1 V2 V7 up to be 7 that are vectors in that space.  Then the span of those vectors is a Subspace.  That is a very important example. So let's do it in the case where we have two vectors. So let's just do the case.  And equals to 4 here so I fixed two vectors V1 and V2, then the span of those two.  That consists of all linear combinations of those two vectors.  That is the definition of the span.  So I claimed that that thing is a Subspace to check that its a Subspace. We just need to check three things. We did check that it contains the zero Vector. When did you check that is closed under scalar multiplication is closed under addition. So for the zero Vector if I just take  X1 and X2 both equal to zero  I see that the zero Vector is indeed in that span. So let's give it a nail is called s is in s  so yes the span of any set of vectors contains the zero vector by taking all the linear combination linear combination coefficients to be 0  Now what if I take two things in there and add them up?  So if I take x1v 1 + X2 V2, that's some arbitrary element of a span and I add to it why one-v-one + Y2 V2 another arbitrate element for to confessions. Y1 and Y2. Well, if I do that then I can recombine these things using the rules of addition and scalar multiplication to look like x 1 + y 1 x v 1 + 2 + Y 2 x V2 and that is indeed in the span of a linear combination of those two vectors.  Okay, and similarly will see that I won't write it down, but we'll see that the Lambda x s is closed under skin of multiplication.  Well, I forgot how to write under.  scalar multiplication  As well so the span of any set of vectors in a vector space that is a Subspace of that space. And if you look back at the previous slide  There were two examples here that were subspaces the first one in the third one. So w and Bob.  And if you think about it a little bit those two are actually over the form span of some vectors are so the first one up there ww.w is actually equal to the span.  of the vectors 100 + 010  Cancel set of all linear combinations of 100 + 010.  similarly, Bob  Bob is the span of four matrices suspend of the Matrix 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  010  000  000100 +  0000 * 1  Play it's a span of those for Matrix Matrix vectors. You take the The Matrix which has a one in each of those four slots were a b c and d are and zeros everywhere else. And then you can just the same way. We usually do when we're riding the parametric solution of a homogeneous system of equations. You can just decompose that Matrix as a linear combination of those for so those two examples that we saw that where the examples of subspaces.  So far, those are of this form they are spans of some vectors.  Let's look at another example down here. Here is a subset of R3. It's a collection of vectors in R3 vectors of the form a - 2 b 2 a + b b for any choice of real numbers A&B we could go through and it's not hard although it. Take a little bit of time to check that. This is a Subspace. It contains the zero Vector for A and B both equal to zero.  Is there a vector is there? That's the zero Factor one and we are both Sarah and I can just check using the rules of addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in R3 that this thing is closed under scalar multiplication and addition but I don't need to do that because I can do the same kind of trick and take this Vector here and decompose it as a * 120 + B * - 201  that - 211  the same sort of thing we did when we were talking about parametric Solutions of homogeneous systems. So this set is actually equal to the span of those two vectors in R3 and so by the the statement above I don't need to check anything. It is the span of some vectors. Therefore. It is a Subspace.  All right. So that's what subspaces are there. Things are subsets of already known Vector space closed under multiplication and addition and contain the zero vector and we've seen a bunch of examples of things that aren't now cuz they violate some of those properties the collection of things that are which in some examples that are they all actually fell into this category. We could always be written as the span of a collection of vectors in the vector space. We will see next day, but that's a universal truth. Every Subspace is the span of some set of vectors. But before we get there now, I want to connect everything we've been doing back with stuff that we did before.  Want to talk about some special subspaces that are associated to Any Given system of equations.  So if I give you an mhxa and for for now, we're going to be thinking of that Matrix as the coefficient Matrix of a system of linear equations. So I give you an M by n Matrix Associated to it. There are two special subspaces.  Subspaces of what and we'll answer that question a minute. I don't mean they're going to subspaces of the space of matrices. Not that abstract sitting there going to be some spaces of RN or RN  And let me just tell you they're definition. So I give you a matrix AI here are two definitions the null-space of the Matrix a which we write a null.  Is the set of all vectors?  X so that a x x equals 0  that's the definition of it.  And the other space is the column space of a and that's defined to be the set of all vectors of the form a x x where X is in our ends in m by n Matrix access to be an RN.  It doesn't just the definitions will explore them in a bit here. But first, let's see, where where do these sets even live so then no space of a  Okay, it is a set of vectors x x of the size that a x x makes sense. So if if a is an M by n Matrix S A X has to be a vector in r n  whereas the column space of a  Call space of a is a set of vectors of the form a x x so if x is a vector that I can melt by Ava it's in a vector in r n then a x x is a size M if x's and buy one and an ASM by n.  Then the vector is my one. So this is a subset of RM.  It so the null space is a subset of the domain everything of a as a linear transformation. The no space is a subset of the domain and the column space is a subset of the ranch. They live in different spaces. Typically if the Matrix is square, they'll be in the same space, but we should think of them as in different spaces.  Know what are these things that I just Define so the nails but these are two objects that we've been studying add nauseam for the last five weeks. The null-space of a is the set of X for which 8 * x equal 0 in other words. This is the solution set.  of the homogeneous system  Who is a coefficient Matrix is a?  That's something that you guys know how to compute for any particular Matrix and we'll do it any sample at the end of lecture here in a few minutes just to cement that again. So this is unimportant subset. We're looking at the solution set of a system of equations in particular the homogeneous solution set for some coefficient Matrix. The column space is the set of all things of the form a x x. So, let's write that out or I'll do it over here. We have a little more space. So that means if I if I take my Matrix a and I write it in terms of its columns.  Does an columns cause an M by n Matrix?  Set a x x is of the form x 1 a OnePlus x 2 A2 plus all the way up to XNA M. That's our definition of matrix multiplication. So it's the set of all vectors of that form for all possible vectors X in other words. It is the span of The Columns of a  that's why it's called the column space. Hey, it's the space consisting of the span of the columns.  We just saw on the last slide that the cut the span of some collection of vectors in his face in a vector space is a Subspace. So this thing the column space is a Subspace. It is the span of the vectors that are The Columns of the Matrix. What about the first one that I called it a space? So the no space. Is that a Subspace?  Well, let's explore that question.  But let's answer that question. So the theorem is yes, it is a Subspace both these things the null space and the column space of a matrix. They're both subspaces of different Vector spaces text. The column space is a Subspace of the range of RN survive RM this the place where a Maps into  The know space is a Subspace of the domain of RN. So they the two can't be compared with each other that often although later on. We'll see ways to do it. And so let's let's give a proof of this or let's outline a proof of this. So first of all the column space  Is the span of the columns?  as we just said  the span of some vectors is always a Subspace.  As we saw to slide to go check. So what about the no space. So the null space is we said  that is equal to the set of vectors X for which a x equals zero. So there's just no way around it. In order to prove that this thing is the definition of Subspace. We need to verify 3sinx is the zero Vector in this subset.  Is the zero Vector in the null space? What does it mean? What does this question mean is the zero Vector in the null space from the definition we're asking is zero one of those vectors X for which a x x is equal to 0 in other words. We're just asking is it true that a times 0 is 0  Is that true?  Yeah.  So that means that zero is in the null space. How about the sum of two things in the null space if I have two vectors X and Y that are both in the null-space of a  is x + y and then I'll space of a that's what we need to check. Okay? Well this question is  Is it true that?  A x x + y equals 0 that's what we need to check given two vectors in the null Space X and Y. Is there some one of those vectors such that a times that Vector is zero.  well  Are we going to see that that's true. We're going to use the Matrix operations the vector operations and note that a x x + y.  is by the distributive property of matrix multiplication equal to a x x + a x y  No exes in the null space.  And that tells us that this thing is 08 * X is there that's a definition of the null-space why is in the no space of a and that tells us that this thing. Is there a  therefore this thing is 0 + 0 which is 0 check.  And then the remaining question we have to ask is.  Is Lambda * X in the null-space of a?  If x isn't enough space of a and that means we need to check is a x Lambda x equal to 0 whenever a x x is and here again, we use the properties of matrix multiplication Lambda being a scalar we can pull through.  That's always true a x 3 x is equal to 3 times x that was one of the true false questions on your midterm.  And this again?  Is equal to this is equal to 0 so, this is Lambda * 0.  So I get zero and yes, so there we have it any scalar multiple of something in the no spaces back in the null space. And so we have no verified both of these statements proving this there.  Okay, both the column space on the no space are subspaces that might sound very abstract, but it's not at all. It's just observations of things that you've been working with all along. So let's just finish here. I'll have to continue the last by the next day but there's two minutes left here and we can do in those two minutes just a practice or something that was on the midterm and something that you've been doing all along. So here is an example of an a  The Matrix a so this one is 3 by 5  And I'm giving you the registration form of that Matrix Matlab calculated that for me. So I want to write down. What is the null space of a welt the null-space of a is the solution set?  of the homogeneous system of equations  That's something that I know exactly how to compute Oki to figure out what the solution set is. I look at the reduced row Echelon form and I can just write it down the solution set X1 X2 X3 X4 X5.  It will I look for the free variables and so here that's a free variable and that's a free variable and that's a free variable. Those are free variables.  Okay, and that means it in the general solution set. I'm going to get x2 and X4 and X5 as parameters. And you know, I like to rename them. So let's do that. Let's call them S T & R.  I know the first equation there says x 1 + 2 x 2 + x 4 - 3 x 5 is equal to 0 and the second equation says that x 3 - 2 x 4.  + 2 x 5 is equal to 0 and there is our general parametric solution. I did that a little quickly right now cuz we're just at the end here but you should go through and do the calculation for yourself to verify that you were a member and are confident how to do that. Let me just do one more step and write this up as ask * 21000 + 10 * 100 - 210 + r * - 30201  And what we see here, is that the no space.  Is exactly the span of those three vectors?  So the null space is always the way you worked out how to always figure out what the null space is what the solution set of the homogeneous system of equations is is to always write in parametric form which always produces a solution set that is written as the span of some vectors. So that's a Subspace. Okay, and that's just new language to describe something you already confident about doing we will continue that discussion on  UC San Diego podcast ",
