As you get settled I'm going to start by asking people that if you're in a group of four for your assignment take a look on Piazza that our classmates who are looking for a group. Even if you've done a lot of the assignment already this time, there are many more assignments and you'll be working with this group so they can pick up the slack later on. So while I'm doing announcements to take a look on Piazza, if you can remember to look later you would only be hanging if you didn't have a roof. So try to look for people with in your section who are looking for group mate and welcome them into your group if you can  You should be in a group by now, but it is okay. If you are not your first assignment is due this Friday that assignment is getting your question together that you're going to be asking throughout the quarter looking for data that you might be able to use.  And thinking about the ethical implications of urinalysis.  I am going to get everybody to go another minute or so to look at the house and then I'll finish with the rest of the course reminder so we can get going from there.  All right for the rest of the reminders as you guys are trying to look on Piazza to help other classmates out and welcome them into your group.  The first assignment due this Friday right before midnight. The third reading is due next Friday again. You'll have something to do every Friday just before midnight.  Degrades from the second reading quiz have been released on Friday night. You should be able to see what you got right and what you got wrong.  Second bullet went up there in the smaller side is reading a discussion questions. That's just a link to questions that you're wonderful ta Sean who's in the front here is putting together each week as he's going through to be used in his section. But these are a great resource for anybody in any of the sections or just want to make sure that you guys have that link on Sean also posted it on Piazza if you're in a group of four or looking for a group or willing to welcome somebody into your group, please let them know. I'm Piazza help them out. If you've already done a lot of first assignment, like I said, they can help pick up the slack on future assignments going forward. The last one. It has a big issue. I just wanted to reiterate that we are trying to minimize and eliminate any emails to TJ's and I ate everything should go on Piazza, so you should not be emailing your t a r i a directly  Any questions on any of that?  Okay.  So starting in on today's topic today is going to be the first lecture where we discussed any type of programming. We're going to be looking at and writing code today. So I learning objectives.  Will be to explain why programming is helpful from the perspective of a data scientist, cuz there are lots of things that code. Can you bring for an accomplished but there's a somewhat special way in which day do scientists tend to program and we're going to include at the end of this lecture and a number of lectures some basic programming for the weights of work. I'll do a normal lecture how we've been doing it for the beginning will then take a little pause. You guys will transition into working on a laboratory notebook, which will be at the end the link that I will be at the end of these lies will get her be settled and then we'll work through that for the remainder. So you guys can actually get some programming practice in class.  So I showed this pot last time except I colored it for Version Control. So just remind everybody these are data from your survey one was I've never programmed and 10 was I Could Teach You intro programming course the programming as I said before that will be doing is geared at the people who have less experience programming for those who are more experienced. That means you will be able to help your classmates. You'll be able to consider how we're going in. This course is different than what you've learned in other courses. So hopefully everybody will learn a bit of programming as a data scientist from this course and we'll start getting comfortable with programming on Pecos with never program before  This is also from the survey that I sent out. So are you looking at here are those who are familiar with python? And those who are familiar with our you can see lots of the students in this course 175 of you are familiar python many of you are not many fewer. If you are familiar with our I picked these two programming languages for the survey because these are the two languages most frequently used by data scientist and we'll be discussing our and I'll show you a few examples of our throughout the course, but you won't be expected to write any are code to read any our code anything to do with python vice-versa is true. I will discuss the differences between them a little bit during today's lecture.  Okay, so we'll get started. I just am curious to know what programming language you are most comfortable in. So the frequency code is 80 is written up on the board. Also if you come in late, which you wouldn't know that message cuz you're already here. Okay?  Make sure your boat registered I had to open it twice.  how to close it in a few seconds  3 2 1  I saw the intro programming course in computer science to the best of my knowledge is taught in Java. Correct me if I'm wrong that many of you who are in this category could also be comfortable in a different language. This is great that we have almost half the class familiar with python that will help when you guys are working on your sinus or help out as we start program class. You can get help from each other's in the neighbor and your neighbors and then a number if you are not a programming language.  I mentioned that we're going to listen to a few minutes. I'll be about 10 minutes of this video. This comes from Bret Victor. He is a criminal minds and thinking about how we Design Systems for programming. So this is a talk that he gave a few years back. And for those of you who are familiar with program and I want you to consider how this differs from the way in which you programmed for those of you who have not programmed. I'm new here sense of how programming works. So we'll listen to this for 10 minutes and hopefully the audio works and I should have tested this before class.  Trump is actually about living a life that most people don't talk about.  Is your portrait career mode?  following your passion  or doing something you love something kind of difference. I'm going to talk about following the principal.  Finding a guiding principle Fair work something you believe is important and necessary and right.  And using that to God what you do?  The three parts of the stock enforcement talk about the principle that guides lot of my work and try to give you a taste of what comes out of that and I'm going to talk about some other people that have looked this way with the principal are what they believe in that help you think about what you believe in and how you want to live your life.  Play with me.  Ideas are very important to me. I think that bringing ideas into the world's one of the most important things that people do and I think that great ideas in the form of stories inventions scientific theory is so I think a lot about how people dance and how ideas grow in a particular tools.  I spent a lot of time of the year is making threats schools using kratom.  craters  needed a minute connection for their credit. That's my principle.  Remember that is when you're making something if you make a change when you make a decision, you need to see the effect of that immediately delay Peter's Hospital. See what they doing.  Number to show you a series of cases where I noticed that the principles violated.  What's think about coding and something comes out?  So this case that says JavaScript going to a canvas and it draws this little scene with the tree.  If there's anything wrong with this can or if I don't like changes I have further ideas. I could go back to the code and the code compile and run.  So it looks like anything wrong I go back to the code. Most of my time is spent working in the code ring a text editor blindly without an immediate connection to this thing, which is what I'm actually find make  I feel disgusting as his principal. I have that cleaners need an immediate connection.  So we're here cuz I thought it's on the side and the code on the side and the mountains.  I want to make any change the code.  the picture changes immediately  So the code in the picture are always in sync. There's no compile and run. I just change things in the code and I seen things change of the picture.  Why don't we have this immediate connection between the code in the picture? We can start thinking about ways of changing the code of than typing. So for example, this number here has enough to it and I was up and down.  So I can see what it looks like for big branches or small branches and I can eat on what feels right to me artistically.  Any sports radio number the Curtis point to it. Up and down and some of these numbers here. I know what they do, but still surprising to see him do it completely surprising.  Turn down here. I thought of putting 16 little pink blossoms on every branch and I can turn that down for Less Blossom her turn up her more look up what I'm doing here. I'm just kind of moving that number up and down around 20 or so and has this really interesting.  The first time I saw this I made me start thinking about how I could use this affect word animation.  How would I ever it's cover that if I had to compile and run but never change?  So much of art creation is Discovery and you can't discover anything if you can't see what you're doing.  Stop casting the code. Let's add some code. So I think I put a sign up here in the sky. So I go to the end of the guy function and I want to fill a circle. So I start typing on contacts Phil Circle. As soon as I start typing I get this autocomplete list of the different film methods and down the soccer complete list. I made it Lee scene with each of them.  So I don't have to imagine what it would do. If a method named and have to learn the documentation. I just seen it immediately for Nets and the y coordinate change the radius of it.  And that looks about right, should be yellow. So I'm going to set the fill Style on text Bill style same as before and I can change that color code the same I change any number went to heaven for Kane and my son.  It was kind of interesting I thought.  How can I expect that but with white and now looks like the moon's fat, right?  It looks like that.  So having some media connection allows ideas to surface to develop in ways, that would be impossible before.  Coastal pulmonary think which is this picture is coat over here and I have to maintain the mapping between the two line. I don't really know what it does.  So here's what I can do. I can hold down the option key to a magnifying glass.  So, I don't know what's going on inspection. I just kind of rolled down the function and see what he would highlights.  Haircut to call to draw Mountain. I don't know which is which  and this has to work the other way to see part of the picture. I need to know what code was responsible for drawing it but do the same thing is he on the right is jumping to the line of code that true that pixel.  Saturn Sky night registry  It's really weird for making that napping but it's also really useful just for navigating around so, you know, I want.  So he's talking about his principle that he likes his design on and the fact that he really needs this immediate connection to what he's created when he's writing code. How is everything going to tell me how this differs or similar to the programming Dave done historically?  This is exactly how you've done. It is this different?  At what is your experience that when writing code?  How many people think this has similar to what they've done before?  Okay, I don't see any hands anybody who thinks this is different than what they've done before. Okay, so we have some hands there.  You've likely written code run it to executed and something has happened. You created something. You've generated a graphic you have built software. This reverse is what's kind of really unique to this the fact that you can highlight something in what you created Anakin direct you back to the code and clearly their design principles behind us that we can use movie for and I think you could imagine you'll see how this could be helpful in his horse will be using jupyter notebook switch allow you to test things out but it doesn't allow you all the full flexibility to test out all of the possibilities as easily as in this video. So it's important to keep in mind that when you're writing code and your specifying a certain values that you're limiting all of the possibilities that could be possible this video just to demonstrate that when you write code and executed something happens to those who are less familiar with programming and to demonstrate that programming is not static how we do it today will not be how we do it in the future and here's another great toe.  About how we are not really great at predicting what's going to happen this videos on YouTube. His other talks are on YouTube. So you're if you're interested you can go find those whoever you're today likely won't be the way we always do it and you'll have to adapt over your career and that they're clearly thinks that we're not doing right now that could be possible and helpful.  All right, sweet an intro. We have some concept of how programming works. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about why you would learn to program with a particular focus on as a data scientist. So there are lots of reasons to learn to code but we're going to talk about within the confines of how data scientists often use it.  So the first one I'm going to show you and I'll walk you through this cuz I know they might not all be familiar often do scientist use tabular data or to spend a lot of time talking about what that means we have here is a spreadsheet of data and we have some countries we have on the continents and then we have some information about the GDP the population and the GDP per capita start at the life expectancy over there overtime. And if he decided he wanted hemisphere rather than continent, you would manually change that and then go through a type all of those in okay, you don't have to type all of them. You could just use copy and paste so you go and do that here in your next category, then you copy it and paste it but this is clearly a slow process. So this is an example of somewhere where code completely need removes the need to do that. So this is our this is not we'll be using this course you can see their code over here the code executes over here. What I'm showing here is that were using that same dataset so you can see the country of the continent in the same information. So says the exact same data set.  I showed you what the spreadsheet we were manually editing code runs. We make the change we can look back at that data. That seems spreadsheet.  As it runs, we look back we can see now that that hemisphere has happened and you can see that old in that initial when I had Pitt western when it should have been Eastern Hemisphere for a country. So we're manually editing spreadsheets we often because we're humans make mistakes. The last thing you would want to do is mess up your data. So code removes the need to manually edit spreadsheet. It also allows you to make some pretty cool graphics. These are those data plotted over time. So it's life expectancy and GDP per capita and we're fast-forwarding overtime and it's broken down by continent just a few lines of code and barcode again. You don't need to know our code. I'm just getting an idea of what you can do.  It allows you to make them flexibly. So after I make that change to which hemisphere there in you can end see all of that data and just to class rather than the five or six before and again, it's just a few lines of Coke.  The goal of writing code and learning the program is so that you don't have to manually edit among many other things. The goal is really to get the computer to do the work for you. You'll save yourself a lot of time and you'll be able to make it work more reproducible.  So let's briefly this will become a clicker question, but I'm going to walk through two videos. So the first one and I'll explain as you go I use the same data. I highlight two columns. I then create a graphic realize it's not the type. I want to change it to a scatter plot, which will talk about it later lecture.  And that's the first example in the second one. I typed out all the code while I was craving it so you can see exactly how long it took.  So I'm loading in a few packages and then I write the code for the plot. I can see that in like four lines of code.  I was typing slowly that day.  Best Buy the pot run that code that executes over here and then down here we will plot and we ultimately have a very similar-looking plot to what was done in the first case. So question is which of these is reproducible one on the left to the one on the right and the options are down at the bottom.  I got a few more seconds.  3 2 1  alright, so we have the majority of people saying that both are reproducible and then about even saying either only one or only two is so I want to have a discussion about your thoughts here cuz we had kind of a people all over the board for a few people that aren't sure so this discussion can help them hone their thoughts on this.  Who are the thought on which one or both are reproducible?  I know you guys had a long weekend and you're tired by one is reproducible.  nobody  I already want to defend why to is reproducible.  awesome, I volunteer  Cuz this one.  another joke  all uses program on other Davis have to perform what they want to do great. So I'm to overhear. The argument is the code is here. We could put that on GitHub. It could be shared by all and then they could use the same bit of codes for different date. Is that going forward? So I'm going to argue that too is reproducible. So for those of you who said that to is I'm with you there. What about 1 why do people think this is reproducible?  I'm going to argue that this one example specific example, I gave you is somewhat reproducible, but I could tell you the steps highlight these two columns click this button change the what and that's three steps.  So this concept can be reproducible when things are really simple, but what if I wanted to change the axis and change the size of the font so that everybody could see it or change the type of font or the colors of the dead. It's a lot of things that you need to keep track of in order to tell somebody else how to reproduce what you did. So what I'm going to say is that on the right hand side to this one where you have code that you can run and get the same result each and every time is the reproducible example and to one sorry is only a beautiful things are super simple.  I'm going to argue here that programming allows for things to be more reproducible, especially as things get more customized and more complicated which they almost certainly will as you start doing your projects.  Any questions on my Arguments for why the one on the right with the code that generate the plot was reproducible and not necessarily the using Google Excel or Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to generate plants.  Okay.  So we talked about the fact that you don't have to manually added data that you can quickly edit data programmatically without ever losing the day to you started with we now talk about how it makes things more reproducible. Never argue that there are a lot of data companies are collecting more and more data. There are lots of data science jobs out there and it is not going anywhere. So we're going to continue to be jobs that require programming skills.  Now here's my disclaimer if through this course you realize you hate programming and that you're not interested in analyzing data and statistics are the worst. I would disagree with you there. And then there are other jobs out there. If you hate it don't do it for the rest of your life. But if you do there are going to be jobs there lots of data that need to be analyzed. Okay, so they can overtime about good reasons to learn to code in fadley reasons to learn to code and I'm just going to have it if you would then you can read you the details later. But your goal is to get super duper rich and to create the next Facebook that's not answer the best motivator for learning to program that could be a byproduct of that could happen, but maybe don't Bank on that. So really you should want to learn to code because it really helps in getting practice with precise thinking if you've never written code before you are going to write that code that creates errors that you have no idea what they mean and over  Time does process will get easier because programming requires you to be incredibly precise but not a letter is capitalized or lowercase matters. The way things are aligned matters and it requires you to really get precise with what you're doing. And while requiring you to be precise is also requires abstract thinking so if you want to solve a problem you first have to figure out how you would write code to solve that problem. So it allows you to practice being precise and also to think abstractly we mentioned already against the computer to do the work for you and it's a great practice for learning itself. We're going to talk about how to learn in a general sense when you're learning to program in a bit.  Okay, you'll get us throughout the lecture and this is really just to let you know if you never program before that, you're not alone. It's not as early as a selling point of learning to program but it will require you to be persistent. It can be a frustrating process. But when you keep getting an error and then finally figured out that part is rewarding at least it should be and again if you are still frustrated at the end sit back and think about why you're frustrated and if it's cuz you hate the process that's something to think about. These next few slides are in here and they're definitely going to sound like a pep talk talk cuz that's what they are. But I think it's important to really solidify how you should approach learning when you're learning to program.  This message is that to learn to program. You have to write code there books out there that you could read and you could get the basics of what's going on and is supposed to be really really helpful, but you won't really learn how to code until you do it. So you'll have to write code in order to learn how to program. So in this course will be doing some of that but in your free time, you can find data online. You can try and do something that interests you and you will get better at programming by writing code.  I mentioned this already can be frustrating and hard you'll comment about wanting to throw your computer out the window from time to time and I still do.  And it wasn't remember is a data scientist fail all the time. You see these awesome analyses are awesome products that are launched from companies. And those are they successful projects at the end of a bunch of failed attempts. They just don't show all the failed attempts along the way. I'm so remember anytime you see something awesome people make mistakes along the way people fail at these don't put that in your product at the end. Okay, this is something I want to cuz I think there's there's lots of different ways people can approach this and I would like to suggest that you first try things on your own but then do ask questions and we'll talk about how you can do that. And I'm supposed to think try read so first you should think about what it is you want to do don't you go hacking away without actually knowing what it is you're trying to accomplish because once you figure out what it is you want to accomplish you'll know if you got there you'll find out if you succeed on the first time awesome. If not, you should go to Google or stack Overflow or that book you have or your friend that sitting next to you or your TA or I or me and office hours and we can help you figure.  I want to look elsewhere for the answer repeat the process think make sure you're still you know, what you're trying to accomplish. Try it out and just do this at her to flee so it that I wanted to see your all your thoughts on how long you think you should try something out when it comes to programming before reaching out to someone for help.  macros in a few seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so we have a lovely distribution where people most people think that it should be in the one-hour Mark and then we have people on either side of that and then some people say it's best to just figure it out on your own.  So I'm going to argue that 5 minutes when your programming in the beginning is likely not long enough. You're going to struggle with things for more than 5 minutes and that's okay. But if you guys are the 30 minutes to an hour mark somewhere in here and you're still having the same wall and have made no progress and can't figure out at all. What issue? I'm you're making then it's time to reach out. And again when you're down here, you can be Googling and looking on stackoverflow. But if you before you reach out to someone else and ask them to help you solve your problem. You should probably spend somewhere more than 5 minutes, but less than an hour.  Sonata 5 minutes is not out of the question. You will spend many time any more than 5 minutes when you're first learning to program.  Okay.  So I called you know, their entire quarter's dedicated to teaching the basics of program or the basics of a single programming language. We're only going to be spending some of a number of lectures in here on program the rain be discussing the concept of end-user program. So how do we utilize the tools that are out there to accomplish our data science goals, and this will not cover all the details you need to know to program for things like exams. I expect you to understand the code that was run in class and to be able to him again. They're all giving multiple choice exams, but to understand what you should do using the tools and skills. We talked about in class.  I'm at about three principles that I want you guys to get good practice on in class today or in class during this quarter. So code generally and there exceptions to every rule should be commented. So this is maybe a little excessive when you're looking at code and you see a pound sign with a space of beginning your line or it just a pound sign to start your line. That is something for the computer ignores and it's just a note to you and anybody else reading your coat. So you would want to do that and this might be a little excessive for a single line of code, but you would want some explanation of what the next few lines of code are doing in your projects.  Also, we're going to have practice having good variables with good names which might be different than what you've done in other on programming Arena if we have a file and this is the name of the file. We're going to assign it to a variable. I'm going to talk in a minute with variables are bile underscore name FN wouldn't be the best variable name because someone else wouldn't automatically know what's included in that variable.  The last thing is a white face alignment matter. Sometimes python will force you to use specific white face alignment and other times. It's just to make it easier for other humans supposed sample, as I had a very many school days and included this information notice that the alignment starts here rather than this option where the variables here and then the contents are lined up with it. This is much easier to see what the variable is and what the contents of them. That's so weird about this right and go to comments having good variable names and white space alignment.  Any questions on those three?  The question is are we going to be using Python 3 or python to where do using Python 3 and all the programming you doing class will be in the collaboratory Jupiter lab notebooks which were going to start at the end of class and that's 3 automatically.  So you won't get anything installed locally for this course, but for your other courses, I'd imagine you would.  Okay.  A little bit on where to find help and how to help others stack Overflow. It will be a great resource for you. So this is what stackoverflow looks like. This is where developers of people who write code from any language not just python go to ask and answer questions. You'll likely want to get an account there. That way you can contribute to the community and what you do is you will search just like you would anywhere else and different question that have previously been asked will show up. They'll be Tagged so you can search my tags you can see what this question was asked in 26 answers and 107 votes the votes help you prioritize which one's the best answer you'll be able to see everybody's answer but the most helpful will likely be the first one up there.  That's what I was going to ask a question, but there are rules for asking questions. You shouldn't just right off the bat ask a question on stackoverflow likely somebody has asked something similar before so you should make sure that that question is not somewhere else. I'm in also the questions on stackoverflow have to be specifically related to programming so to be on topic and it should be specific in specific means you can't just ask a very general question without anybody else having fun texting while you're asking the question also has to be relevant to others that can't be how do I do my analysis on this particular dataset you wanted to get it down to a question. That would be generalizable to the greater population.  So I'm going to spend a few slides on talking about how to help others. So, how can I be a jerk? You should be mindful of your word choice and tone I talked about this on Piazza. You guys have been great so far you guys in your email to me have been nothing but respectful. I really appreciate that and this likely doesn't apply to you guys. The thing is it has become a place on the internet. That isn't always welcome to everybody. So I feel the need to include this in here to remind you to or anywhere on the internet be kind helpful and don't be a bigot. Okay, and the reason is important is because last year stackoverflow announced that their platform is not very welcoming and it's time to change that so they acknowledge that they have a problem and that people on stackoverflow have been jerks more often than is acceptable. I was it acceptable level 0, but they were way above 0  So they put out this code of conduct and you can read the whole thing. If you'd like to add a very specific examples of how to not be a jerk. So for example, what you should not do is if you bother to read my question, you know, it's not a duplicate. That's not a helpful way to respond to somebody instead you cuz I don't think it says duplicate. My question is about cement board while the question you asked is not drywall to specify what required by what it is you're asking about rather than going to what can sometimes be easier when you're on the Internet or in general to jump to being negative.  I'm going to have you as we threw these which of the following is the best response if you were responding to somebody on stackoverflow.  I'm going to close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  so you all overwhelmingly said  I'm not I'm not sure I quite understand but I think you're asking about and then you would clarify that is the only one that will move this in a productive manner for word.  This one is just a statement. It's not going to help clarify what's going on? It's not going to move everything forward and the same with this one. This is not an acceptable response and this if they ask the first time they probably did their best to try to help guide them as to what would be a better way to frame the question.  We talked so far about what programming looks like with a video we talked about why data scientist program. We talked a little bit about the benefits and how it improves reproducibility and what generally a coach that look like. This is the part of the what should I learn?  So you're looking at here are data again from stack Overflow. They do a survey every year and we have on the y-axis is the percent of stack Overflow questions that month. And so you're looking over time and the orange line is python so you can see that over matter of 10 years. They went from 4% of the questions on stackoverflow to about 10% So Python and R are the most commonly used programming languages among data scientist with python being more popular than r  The reason of these two are the ones that data scientist intend to use because there are lots of other programming languages out there that are great for lots of different things specifically R and python have a clear simple structure and syntax. So you will be able to learn the basics pretty quickly and then those will apply throughout your process of learning more more. So we're going to cover just the basics of using us to analyze data and discourse but the clear simple syntax makes learning the beginning pretty easy and getting started pretty easy.  This rapid development and prototyping you're able to I right through different things and try a bunch of things out pretty quickly and easily. So it excuse with it will be using these do for lab notebooks code executes within the notebook you be able to try a bunch of things out without making a bunch of time and last thing they're all cross-platform compatible. They work on these operating systems and their large online communities for both for both R and python. So your questions that you have have likely been asked before and you can get help online.  With regards to python its projected to just keep on growing overtime and while you can't predict the future too far out down cuz different things happen in the programming world. It's predicted that you'll be using python for a while.  I'm with the right place on an AR. This is looking at you over your growth and you can see the python and our have very similar year-over-year growth. And as I mentioned python just has more users from the get Deco. So it's bothering creasing it similar rates. Python is used by more people.  The one caveat to mention is that academics tend to use are so if you're going to go into biological research or you're going to go into statistics of biostatistics in Academia intend to work in a lab, you're more likely to use our than you are python again. It's not a hard-and-fast rule.  Okay, so that's why are a python are used will be using python in this course. I'm here is a picture of Guido van Rossum. He is the person who wrote Python and he has written this then of python. You don't need to memorize this you don't need to fully understand any of it. But what you want to know is that there are mantras that exist within the python community and they are expectations of how you will use Python server example, beautiful is better than ugly. There is ugly code you can write that will run and there is pretty cool that you can write that will run and pretty code. The one that has good good alignment that's easier to me by humans and can be understood by humans just reading through it is better than ugly code that still runs the same thing simple on the same idea is better than complex complex is better than complicated. The goal was always to write code that is as simple as possible. That's not always possible and those cases it's okay to make your coat a little more complex, but you really want to avoid making it overly complicated.  Cigarette through the recipes just want you to know that the Zen of python is a thing any python world and that it's good to try to adhere to these mantras.  Let's talk about our talk about python. If you go on the internet right now and search why are is stupid and my python a stupid you'll see lots of responses from community members hating the other one just mentioned that he's like maybe the biggest name in our world and he's one of the biggest names in the python world and their work together on a project. There's no reason use what works for you. There is no reason to track the other one because you like one. I'm better than the other.  But I had it at this but I wanted to make it explicitly clear data science is constantly changing. It has changed a lot over the 10 years that it has become a popular term to start somewhere. With python in his course, but technology changes you're going to be required to know and use and learn more than one programming language in your career. So a quality of a great day to scientist is that they are able to adapt to new technology in new programming languages quickly.  Okay. Oh that's had so far. I want to touch on what differs between how you maybe learn to program in a computer science course versus how we're going to be approaching programming in a data science course form of Honor there any questions  Okay really is at the core of what the truth feels are. So computer science is the study of the theory and practice of how computers work. The goal is to understand the ins-and-outs of computers where data science is the scientific process of extracting value from data. The goal is to understand the ins-and-outs of the date of your working with because of these differences in the fields. The typical job duties are a little bit different. So I'm overgeneralizing hear computer scientist do lots of different things but most often they are writing code that goes into some software or some application or integrating parts of their code with a larger product. So they're working in teams in testing and documenting and debugging code. Where is data scientists are collecting cleaning and organizing their data sets there going to be answering questions and building models with which to answer their now the question with their analysis and they're going to be making visualisations to help communicate their findings.  Because of this data is the emphasis in data science. So your programming skills should always work with focusing on the data. Whereas computer scientist are great and super important, but the process is a little bit different as to how you approach programming.  I like to use this visual. So there's a balance between lots of things. And again, this is a generalization but data scientist or more users of the tools that are out there to answer their questions. Whereas computer scientists are more heavily creators the building something new rather than utilizing with already out there.  Some more specifically data scientists are really good at getting the data. They need off in this means getting it out of a database will touch on that next lecture and it works with exploring cleaning. The data will be doing that in this course with python and they're very comfortable working with tabular data, which will also talk about next lecture. So Python and R make both of those steps very easy, and I prioritize reproducibility, which we've already talked about and it goes to program to answer a question.  I call you this so you can look over what is expected of a data scientist will be doing a number of those things in this course, but not all of them.  Okay, let me give you guys a minute to transition here. You'll want to open this link. If you have an earlier version of slides. I put the wrong link on the side and you will need a request permission. You'll need your UCSD email address to access this if you don't have a computer that is okay. We'll be walking through this notebook in a minute or two.  Chopin's who was able to access the link. I'm a little nervous about the Wi-Fi in the room. Do you have the link open?  Set bit. Ly cos 9 underscore programming.  They be trying to access it and doesn't have it open yet.  a lot of people getting request for access  cuz you need to use your UCSD email or Gmail account.  Anybody still trying to access that's having trouble a few.  Is it because you're using your Gmail or cuz?  necklaces for just a second  I tried to change the settings so that you could use it. Even if you were not using UCSD, but it's not working.  Okay where to get started you won't need access to it, but hopefully we can work his cake topper next time. So feel free to let me know what issues you're having after today's class. So this is what you'll see on your clever notebook to edit it. You'll need to copy a link in you need to make a copy into your drive. So you would go into a file and then save a copy and drive.  So for my end, this is what it looks like just the color is going to look a little different and I'm going to presented a slide just lies are also available on Triton Ed. So this is a jupyter notebook. That is very similar to The Notebook that you're using here.  and  each day that we do programming. There's going to be the electric part and then they're going to get programming part and I'm going to give you guys time to follow along at the code. See what happens to the programming today. We're going to discuss deuteranope variables variable naming different types of operators and variable types.  So we talked about this a little bit before but you those collaboratory it documents you using for your assignments are too for notebooks and their way to combine code that you can excuse to get the output of the code and text into a single file.  Cells are the operational unit within a jupyter notebook and they are independent. So you can write code in a cell and to run if you hit shift enter or go up to the top and click run and they can be used for writing different things either text for code.  super example, this is a markdown cell so I can go in and edit this in the middle of class and  This is all normal markdown. I can make it.  Italic by using the markdown that we talked about last class and then I hit shift enter and now it's reflected in my jupyter notebook.  Hotels work very similarly. So you would see the number for the cell which tells you the order in which the cells will run you to see the numbers for the lines of code. What we have here is a variable name on the left and then the value stored within that variable. We're going to discuss variables in a little more detail and then print just says to show you what is stored within variable name and the same thing I can edit this.  variable to equal 7  and then print variable to remember shift enter Then runs it and we can see both print statements that we've stated. We see the output of that.  Taping works for numbers so you can operate on them and will get back to you how to do it in a little more detail. But if I signed a tad the value one and be to have the value of 3 if we add them together and assign it to the variable C and we print see we get the answer of 3 + 1.  I am I said this out loud, but I wanted to make sure you all had it in the notes. But numbers in the square brackets to the left of the cell. So these numbers tell you the order in which the cell type and run and ask her if it means that it's currently running and you don't need to run sales in order this for people who haven't written code and notebooks before tend to be somewhat unintuitive so I could go right hundred five different cells. I can create a variable in the hundred V cell and then go back to V cell and that will be available. So they don't have to be running order everything stored in the environment that you run and you don't have to run the cells in order to have the variable of their available.  Can't we talk about this in lecture? Your code should have comments what this actually looks like in a notebook means that for that code. I just wrote here. I would say Define variables and hear complete calculation again for simple code. It's not as essential as when you start doing things that are more complex during urinalysis.  Okay, because if you have an open you should go back to what we've already done edit things change things run code. So change variable names change what's included in the variable run those cells and if you are stuck ask a neighbor or if they don't have this open on their computer. I'll give you guys a few minutes to test the running the code out.  If you requested access you should not have it.  Florida be another few seconds for those  I did anybody make any changes that created errors that they weren't able to figure out.  So I've been using this term variable and that's what's on the left hand side of the equal sign button programming variables are things that store values to actually Define it and they're too fine with this. You have the name of the variable and then the value stored in a variable.  And just to be very clear variables in programming are not the same as variables in math and code. The equal sign is used for assignment in math. It's to evaluate quality. So just keep in mind. Just give me the same or it doesn't have the same meaning.  and there are  Rules for declaring variables the variable name is always on the left hand side at Sally's on the right hand side variables are case-sensitive. So a if you write capital seat with lowercase a t and all our kcat those are two different variables and they must always start with the letter variable 10 include numbers and underscores, but they cannot include special characters and python doesn't care how you name your variables but humans do care and we talked about that and lecture.  So good variables have good names. This is a radiation from lecture. But I wanted to drive Point home. Now that we can see it in the form of actual code in the notebook here. If we assign these four values to H.  That doesn't really give you any insight into what those are whereas Heights using the same for Parables. You now know that these are individuals Heights.  If you have a background in our or Matlab one thing that can cause you problems at the fact that python is 0 indexed. So we're talking about that same variable Heights with story those four values. The first value is accessed using the syntax tree of Heights open square brackets and a zero this the output of this is 65 the first value following along if you wanted to access the second value, that would be a 1 and if you wanted to get the last value would start from the end where this would be -1. This isn't here just for anybody who's more familiar with our or Matlab which happens to be one side and 0 in next.  Okay, I'll give you a few minutes ago. What time on this one play around change of variables the names change the output is seed to make sure you understand the concepts of indexing and naming.  I got a few seconds.  Are there any general questions about this part?  I showed you her before that use an arithmetic operator, but I wanted you to find them here. You can add the values within a variable and also subtract multiply divide 2 multiply you use an Asterix to divide a slash into exponentiate something you would use to Asterix together with no space.  So you can use it as a calculator. You can specify a value here where it would add the two of them together, but you can as a show do for a sine values two variables and multiply them together and get the output same for division.  So those are athletic operators they carry out the Matthew expect them to carry out.  But there's another set of operators that are really important when you are carrying out now cease and those are relational operators or comparison operators. I'm so if you want to know if two variables are exactly equal to each other you would use a double eagle sign remember a single equal sign with d for assignment to a variable this checks whether or not variable a is equal and contains the same information as variable. This one here. Is it! Or bang equal sign is not equal to what does a is not equal to be the rest of them should look familiar from the math course, so you have little less than and greater than and less than equal to or greater than and equal to.  Saint we assign variables and a to have the guy 5 and be to have the value to if we were then to ask whether or not a is exactly equal to be that would be false because these values are not the same somewhere late. We know that 5 is not less than or equal to 2 so these produced false. These are called billions where to find those in a second alternatively a is not equal to be so that is true or a is greater than they also true. So conditional operators are going to give you either true or false out as a response.  I'll give you guys a few seconds test without make sure you can predict what the so if you change the values around on a pier make sure you know, what the Apple over here. You can change those using different conditional operators.  Give you guys a few seconds for that.  Another few seconds any questions on arithmetic operators or conditional operators?  Okay, the last time I'll talk about today for today are variable types. There are lots of different variable types in Python whirling to be discussing the few that will likely be most helpful to you in doing your assignments and as a data scientist, so it's important to know that every variable has a type and it refers to what is stored in a variable and how the computer stores that data. So for example, if I say that my variable name stores the value one, you can always use type with an open parentheses around the variable name and it will return what type of variable is stored in that variable.  So this is storing an integer.  Integer store unsigned whole numbers just like the integer you expect from a math course.  I'm so if I assign values to these two variables.  I thought I had you can have it back here and then do type.  Another integer, it will return that it is an integer.  Floats are also numbers, but they allow for sign so far whether positive or negative and decimal points.  Same thing here a sign both 1.0. This is now float because we specified that there is a decimal place and this is now a float because it has a negative so it's signed and because it has information about decimals.  So aggressive type are those are floats.  Laughing will do a few more so strings Orchestra characters as text. These are both strings same process type of the variable categorical variables, which will talk about next lecture ten strings and fleance we talked about these it's either can be true or false. These are the gets returned from a conditional comparison.  Same process the last thing are none often in datasets. We have enemies and our data and we need to know that that date is intentionally not there and hasn't been accidentally deleted. So we need to have some way of storing the concept of none and so in basic python, that's none will talk about how I'm pandas pandas that which is a little different in a layer lecture.  I only have tax benefit you guys are going to answer you. I just want to the last part or helpful if you've never coded in python python before so if your function and you want to pull up the documentation, you can always add an? To the end which will fill it up.  This next part is really important. If you have recorded before there's tab complete capabilities. So if you are start typing the name of a function, but can't remember what it is. You can hit tag within the cell with energy for Notebook and it will give you the possibilities are so play around with Chad complete.  and all you guys go  But hurry up this year.
