No reason an abacus. This is projecting.  All right. How are you doing now? You're back here me.  I need to get started.  Alright, so is a reminder to the picking me up it is. Okay. So lonely, I like yellow the first word out and then I get all the feedback and I'm really trying not to now I can't tell if you all can hear me. All right, so when was quiet down, let's get started. How's everybody doing people's look like a little more tired this week a little more stressed further waiting in the room before I came in there was an exam here before and it was high pressure in here. Okay set a reminder. There will be a jupyter notebook at the end of class just like last time if you're familiar with the material covered here, you are free to leave like a bee, but I'm going to mention after last time the exit door. So people staying in learning and it drowned their time then so you need to leave and quietly and quickly. So why would in the transition if you don't want to say head out then okay, so we're talking about data wrangling in the notebook today.  Open usual course Riders. You do have a reading quiz do tomorrow so far scores. Okay, for those who have taken it on first exam is next class at the end of class. That's 30 multiple choice questions in the last 30 minutes of class. And your second assignment due next Friday. You'll get me back on by the end of this weekend on your first assignment.  I got a few questions about this. I just wanted to make sure everybody's on the same page. You can see your old reading quizzes and the correct answer and what you said and it's in a bad spot on TriNet. Cuz sometimes trying is not designed and the best way to see if you click on the quiz and then click begin that allows you to access your old scores. There might be another way to do that. But this is the life wonderful way to try and I decided to make it accessible to you. Second is just a notice. It will probably be obvious the next time you're on gradescope, but we're going to submit assignments by section. It would make it easier on the graders and it doesn't make it any different unusual. You just submit to the correct section since y'all know your section. That shouldn't be a problem.  All right. We're going to get started. I'm going to have a few clicker questions to get you all thinking.  Remember, it's a t I didn't write it today.  And then I'll take questions that you may have about the exam.  What?  Outside there's a decimal point in a it that says 2.5 if you can't see the difference there. Thanks.  I should make that bigger next time or different song.  I thought you were talking about the code. I thought you're talking about the code which is a d and I was like  I have a few more seconds for this one.  3 2 1  Sebastian jar of you are familiar with the fact that the two asterisks here are four exponentiating. So you're exponentiating the value of a peso 5 ^ 2.  next one  What's the output here?  How close it in a few seconds?  3 2 1  Okay, Amber clear. It seems from the vast majority of us how conditional operators work. So this is a is not equal to B and that we know based on the values. There is true. So is the right answer this is to give you an idea of how while you're not going to be writing any code on the exam. There could be some that show up in a multiple-choice form.  And this one similar but different to the question we talked about last lecture. So I will let you all take a look and the question is which of these spreadsheets is best.  I don't close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  I said vast majority of people said D, which is the correct answer to anybody want to tell me why a b or c are not ideal what's wrong with them?  Okay, so A&B, we're saying that height and male and female are both in the same column and you want the third column to allow you to compare between them that what you're saying.  Great. So you want each variable to have its own calm when you're entering that didn't especially so that's a and b what's the issue in C?  are there  I'm only asked for Anavar only female and male betta point is that with insects? It's not coded consistently. So sometimes you're writing female and sometimes writing ass and you would want that you want to pick one and stick to it and the one that's most clear would be writing out female fully but either would be fine any questions on spreadsheets or the programming so far.  I told you last time if you have questions, I have all the topics recover so far diesel or what will be on the exam. Does anybody have pressing questions things they want clarified about the readings about the time in about these topics.  Well good for the exam next week, or I'll just going to look at everything this week and I haven't started yet.  Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I'm sure you all have a bunch of exams this week. Okay?  I had a feeling we wouldn't have any questions, but I also had a feeling that y'all wouldn't be upset if we finished earlier today than later so left time for questions. You can ask them at the end if you come up with any.  No questions last chance.  What?  sample exam  you're the first one taking my exam at UCSD. So I'm sure you're all really excited about that. So there are no previous exams to show you all but it is multiple choice. I'm not out to trick you and it supposed to get at your understanding. So I want you to stay I don't want to be the stupidest exam you've ever taken but I'm not trying to get you at any point on the exam.  The best sample exam you have would be to just look over the clicker questions. Although arguably allows answer on right answers to the clicker questions. So those are a perfect proxy. Yes.  any code tracing  any other questions?  So we started talking about data wrangling last lecture and if it hasn't become clear yet. I'm hoping it's becoming clear that we're trapped like tracking and Analysis through the entire course we started with how you should ask questions what types of questions what are ethical questions? We don't work to where you would find data how you would start wrangling the day to get to it. And I know that this stuff may seem a little dry and I am in the future trying to think of more creative ways and engaging ways to make data wrangling seem as important as it is cuz it is very important and I know it's dry, so  Any thought y'all have I'd be happy to hear but I do know that this isn't the like most interesting topic to hear about but it is so important and you have to be really good at it. So we talked last time about tidy data principles and how data should be entered in spreadsheets seems like you all are doing well with that. And today we're going to discuss the classical things you do when trying to Wrangle days that things you often have to do when you're working with tabular data.  Like I said, we talked about data vocabulary. So that's variables were talking it better and Rose and observations on Collins and types of data. We talked about the rules of typed data so that a single variable goes in a column single observation goes in every row that if you have more than one type of data is stored in a different table and that if you have more than one table that they are able to be linked by a column that has the same column name.  I'm entering data into spreadsheets the need for consistency how information should be entered in the best approaches for that.  What's up with the idea that the what we call going from this mess of a spreadsheet to something that can be analyzed easily is called Data wrangling.  We've also talked about data wrangling in a sentence in a lot of examples I presented but I haven't explicitly explain the fact that there's a tidy dataset in the middle. So for example, if you remember in the world that have been it was in the getting data and this and this was the instructor part we talk about texting me talk about Jane Austen's books. We said that if you take all the texts across her famous novels here, you can analyze that and at the end you get out this trace of how positive or negative sentiments are across the trace of the book.  In the middle of that to do the analysis, you can't just take all of this text and say what the answer you need to have some way of analyzing. It's in the middle of this. There's that I need a spreadsheet where you have the information of the words and the novel and the frequency of that word in that novel and then some Metric about where it happened in the novel. So there is a big spreadsheet and this type of data form that allows you to answer this question from your initial data set.  The same thing goes for the Trump lies example where you web scraping information from a website and we got to the point where we had a dataset including each y in each row and then the information that we were collecting from each piece in each column, and that's what allowed them to summarize information. So either we're talkin about unstructured data often is a tidy spreadsheet in the middle that allows you to answer the question.  Same thing happens for that example where we were starting with lyrics and then look and see how repetitive they were and compressing in the more compressed the more repetitive the lyrics were that allowed them to analyze all of these songs from decades and determine whether or not they were getting more repetitive over time.  So to be able to do this cool now it says you have to be able to work with tidy data data and spreadsheets tabular data and how to be good at it and quick and know what to do. And there a lot of common tasks that you doing this summer still Touring review ordering and a can be done on rows and columns. You can create new columns and we'll talk about how to do that. And also you want to be good at summarizing data and know which summaries you want to do. We'll talk about this in this lecture as well as the young descriptive analysis lecture.  Okay, so it's going to be somewhat different. I'm going to have a few positive what y'all think about it and see cuz I looked at these a lot you haven't looked at them as many as much and I might be using an approach that slightly different than how you have done it historically and python but it is I think the clearest way to do it. So if you want to filter Rosso say you want to get just part of the information off in your working with big spreadsheets or big databases and you're really only interested in analyzing some subs that the information so you want to filter the rose only wanted the rose here where the individuals were female you would be able to do that using this method called planters for wear and I'll demonstrate in the superior portion of this why I'm using this approach.  But the resulting spreadsheet from that would be just the observations where the individuals had faced x equal to female.  Places to work and I'll show you an example of where it works and then I'll show you an untidy example of why this wouldn't work question.  Cuz I changed it halfway through the lecture and that is a typo. Thank you. This should be equal to F. It should be a capital f thank you. It happens when you change things this morning. So that will be an issue throughout and I apologize and I'm glad you brought up from the beginning. So the point is that in the table. It says that sex is f so, this should also be capital F my apologies.  So anytime you think this is an example of where it wouldn't work. And in fact here you can see and this is the wrong answer from the clicker question earlier where you have height and sex in the same column that you try to just to get out the cases where the individuals email that wouldn't work and you would not be able to easily fill Tuesday to the way you would want and that's why we use a tidy data format in the beginning cuz that is able easily able to do all of these operations.  Repository beseech example just to make sure you see why it's not possible.  Okay, so you're subset of individuals observations that you want to analyze and also you want to make sure that you can sort them in a way that makes sense visually so here when we look at high if we try to see what all the guys are or what the smallest to the largest it's not easy busily. So you sometimes want to sort the rows based on their value in a column. So here you could use sort values and height to accomplish that any output would have all of the Rose reordered based on height.  Okay, so we talked about getting that said that you want once you had your subset you can reorder the rows based on their values in the column.  What about this example where we had the information I'm confounded in these columns here you're able to sort them but it takes sorting on two different variables in order to accomplish that I'm just another example as to why you don't want to enter your information like that or when is entered like this. You might want to fix it and get a new title way before you proceed on.  Secure you can sort based on values. We have to store it on two different variables.  We talk about now getting the sense that you want. We've talked about sorting on the values in a column and we just talked about how you can do that on two different columns. The next thing is working on the operation, so far. We've been filtering on Roseville turn on the values in the Rose. You can also operate on the Collins.  So the method all suggest here is that use fly underscore select. This allows you to just specify the column you want in your resulting table. So here you would specify ID first and sex and you would then drop the ones that you did not specify.  systolex the column that you want any outfit  One thing to note here is that to reorder them in a different way. You just reorder the order in your selection. So now first sex and ID would be the order cuz that's what's best if I hear.  where to get ID first X or the output changes based on the order that you specify  So in this case, if you were to try to get that same output for the same reasons as before you can't do that because there is no sex column that variable is not included. It's tied up in these two columns. So you could specify those two columns. But if the information we wanted was here we wouldn't be able to get that out using that same line of code.  All right. So we talked about filtering on rows and columns getting the subsets of Rosie want getting a subset of columns reordering a Collins where there's a column that you want to be in your table that is dependent on other information in that table you have. So this one is a example of if you wanted to add a column called patient underscore doctor you would use a sign to create a new column and function here saying we wanted to be the value gray if the ID is less than 2,000 and otherwise we want to be Shepherd.  So we look at the airport. We still have all of the columns. We had previously with added this new column where it's gray. If your value is less than 2,000 in the ID column and Shepherd if greater than 2000.  So a sign allows you to create a new column based on the values elsewhere in the table.  Alright, so what if we tried that on are not type dataset Wellness case, okay, it would work because we're so this is a case where it worked but we already have all the other reasons why that table is a subpar.  So you're having a lot of you have to do with the date of that often to get the information you want to be able to do urinalysis. You want to make sure when you start it then as Tiny a format as possible. But once you have that there's a lot of information. You want to glean from your dating site and something you'll do often is grouping and summarizing.  so  the function you would want to get some summary information is its aggregate function? So you use egg and specify that you want the mean of the height column they'll put their is height. And this is their other easier ways to get the meaning of height. The reason that I give helpful is because you can first group by other column. So here if you prove by sex, you can then calculate the mean of the height with insects.  This is something you end up doing with it if that's a lot because you need to see whether or not these values differ and height something you would expect likely to differ between biological sex. But this is something you would check you want to know whether or not you have more females or males. These are things that you could calculate and summarize using the approach of grouping and an aggravating.  If you again you attempted this in our example, we can't group I sacked so there would not be the output to easily get that. You could take the mean of this pollen in the mean of this, and drop all the enemies, but I think you can see why it's a lot easier to just have that tidy data set.  So is their transition. We're going to work through those and I'll show you chaining and they look so if you're familiar with all of that and have used this approach, you're free to leave and we'll have the exam on Tuesday after part of lecture.  another 30 seconds  Raise your hand if a Wi-Fi is working.  I cut out.  All right, we'll get started in like 30 second raise your hands if you have it open in Wi-Fi's working.  Yeah, I think the Wi-Fi's down him here specifically.  Alright, let's focus back in you may not be able to open the notebook. And that's okay. You have the slides on Triton Ed and the information will all be here for you to look through.  so all those topics  but we just discussed. I'm going to walk through and demonstrate how you would use that on a dataframe.  And if you were to read a python textbook there a lots of ways that data frames are explained in those are all true. And if you understand all of the do you understand python deeply those will all make sense, but for our purposes were just going to think of dataframes the same way. We think of tabular data or spreadsheets this information in rows and it's stored in columns, and it's all stored together and those that information is connected so think of dataframes as spreadsheets and we talked before that. We're going to continue to use pandas to work with these  We're going to hear import the data as you did before will work with the same example as we did previously. So remember anytime you working today to find you first need to import pandas and then you're able to use the Panda 3 Dinosaurs TV functions the FV function.  I need this is something that I think is worth the hassle to be able to use that fly underscore selected anywhere in the lecture. I had pie underscore you first need to have the pan display does not come standard. It's a newer package, but I think it makes and I'll explain why doing data wrangling a lot easier in Python. So I think it's worth if you all want to use it the first time, but the find run it that will install it and then you can import what you need from that to run all the code in this lecture.  Set a reminder. This is where we left off. Last time. We did it there is a status at where we have information about State and region and then we have Ages which is just whether or not this is a summarization for people who are minor work for everybody the year in which the data were collected from that state or region and then the population in that that location in that year.  So I told you I'll be grouping a lot. So we're just going to get the hang of that. I wanted to point out that you can group on more than one value. So if we group the data by state and region and then by ages  When you do that you don't get any really helpful output from python because it's not enough to group that you don't want to do something with that group data.  So we then use egg as I mentioned. So what I'm showing you here is a little different than maybe how you would have done it otherwise so we have here is a dataframe population and then I'm using something called method explain. Why each row is something else that we do to the dataframe. So I'm saying is refers to take population then group it based on state region and then ages and then take that group data and aggravated and calculate the mean for the population and I just look at the first you wrote that allows you to do one step after another without having to assign it all back to a different variable after each step in the output is that you have some state or region and then you have the mean ages across all of the Year summarized based on the ages. So we're grouping it and then summarizing it. So you get the summer station across all the years broken down by both these two categories be specified.  So why am I using this approach?  So this is what approach so I'll let you take a look, but you  what's this code showing?  I'll come back to it. Let's take a slightly better approach.  What are we showing here the same information presented a different way?  I'll come back to this. All right.  The finally what do we have here?  What am I demonstrating in this code?  but that  OKC someone going uphill  Okay, so anybody familiar with the nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill that was recited there. So Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water Jack fell down. He broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after so this is a common nursery rhyme this I think demonstrates how method chaining which is what we're using here makes has the clearest way to do it. So let's go back to the first approach which is one way that you can write python code. So we start with Jack and we know that Jack and Jill went up the hill and they affect water and then we apply that to Jack who fell down and then he broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after all the informations in there. It's just not in an order that's easy to read in when you're looking at this code.  So this one is the same information so we can we start at Jack and Jill and we specify that they went up the hill and then we created variable on the hill and then we apply to that one Hill fats, which is the water. They said so we're storing lots of different variables, but we really only care about the output at the end when it's just the output at the end that you care about but there are lots of steps in between messaging is really helpful what this says is start with a starting point and then apply the Fetch and then once we have to apply the style and the broken the tumble after and this makes it a lot more readable and easy to figure out what's going on. That's when using throughout this notebook and I think this is the best approach to wrangling data.  So let's go ahead and do that with the state. Is that what if we wanted to rename a column? This is something I didn't touch on his lecture. There is a helpful method called rename and I'm just going to say that state and region isn't the nicest variable names. I'm just going to change this to stay cuz ultimately I'm just going to use the state, California.  Okay, so we can all see that the column state has been changed.  The information in it is all the same. It's just the variable name that changed.  Right now it's going through a process and the way I'm going to do this isn't I'm going to build on what we've done previously in the last lied. So if we only want to include total population values from the state of California, the first thing this is what was done in the last side. I'm going to build an each time. I build I'll have some comments here to explain to you later what was going on and we'll just keep building off of this. So this is where we're going to use ply where and where does specify that ages. We only want equal the total and we went state where is equal to California and you can see all of the output here. We now get the rose that we care about most. Yes.  Yeah, that's a great question. So this is part of the ply package the pandas fly that you install. So otherwise you would normally have to have ages in some sort of quotations right in Python. So this just this act specifies that were specifying a column in the data frame. It's a slightly weird send text but I don't love but it's how it works and pandas fly as a question here is why is there the sex here and this is what they were specifying a column in this date of rain that we started working through.  So that is a syntax thing of pandas fly.  Right 2 know it's filter columns that we want. We talked about fly select in lecture. I'm going to mention drop here.  So Right Now the ages calling is unnecessary because you've already filter the same across all of the Rose so we can specify after we collect the information we won in the last week and then drop the column ages  You see that now we only have three columns the alternative to this is what I mentioned in lecture.  Is that you use ply underscore select and you see that same syntax?  Up here. We see the X and text here were using the single quotes to select which columns we want and this is where you get the same output as before the same information, but you can reorder The Columns in here if you so choose.  So continuing on so we have our population we rename that one column. We've been filtered only include where ages equal total and the state if you go to California reflected The Columns years state in population in that order and now we sort the values based on year because before they weren't really in order that made sense. So now we're sorting where the earliest year is at the top and then the most recent year is at the bottom.  And I will use a sign to create a new column. So what if you aren't great at Mental Math with years and you just want a simple way to know how many years ago something was you could create a function here that says we want to specify how many years it was a go where it just takes the year that you had and says how many years ago was that so simple maybe not something you would do and I'll practicality but I sign is what you would use to make you calm.  I the last one I went to make and will continue on this in a later lecture is that it's really important to know whether or not you were missing values in your data and play some for some reason. I see lots of people getting rid of their missing values as they read their file in which in some cases is okay, but often you want to know if data are missing so you should like be aware of what they are missing rather than just getting rid of it before you even knew it existed. So, I think it's better practice to read an entire day. Is it and then start figuring out what data are missing? So here we staying in that initial data from a population are any of the values know and then we're going to print that portion of the data set and we finally see that for Puerto Rico. We don't have information on population for many of the years and that's if you look at the shape of that it's 20 rows and 4 columns so you could get a better sense of what day do you don't have by looking at it directly talk about how important this is in a later lecture. I know those quick for today if anybody has any questions about the exam. I'm here to answer happy to answer if you have them and if not, I'll see you all on Tuesday.  sandiego.edu "
