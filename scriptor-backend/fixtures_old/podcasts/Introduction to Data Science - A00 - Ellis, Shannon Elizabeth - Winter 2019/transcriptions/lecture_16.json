    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Artist people filter in we'll get started the same as I mentioned Tuesday just a reminder. Your second exam is a week from Tuesday. So we'll have lecture Tuesday and Thursday next week and then the second exam at the end of class on the following Tuesday. It covers the first date of visualization lecture through the geospatial analysis lecture. It includes the three readings 3:45 and it will be a few programming questions. So today we're going to start with some review questions to get y'all thinking about the types of questions that could be on the second exam will do this today Tuesday and Thursday and we'll try to go through the topics that are covered on those will be quicker question. So we'll start with those after that. We're going to finish up machine learning talking about our third example. So we talked about 2 on Tuesday and will finish the third today and then we'll discuss algorithms in general. There will be three short videos that will use to talk about algorithm. So we'll watch those toward the end of lecture any questions about the second exam before we get started on clicker questions.  Play The Carter 5 songs. I want you to First think about what you think the right answer is then feel free to discuss. This should help you determine whether or not you understand this particular question on this topic as we get started. So the question is you want to visualize how many of each species of animal is included in your data set. How would you visualize those?  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so 70% of you got the answer, right? The answer is barplot. Does anybody want explain to me how they came to that conclusion?  Or just thinking how did you walk through into turn? That was the right answer?  Y'all just guess the right.  Okay, so you saw the fact that it was a categorical variable. It was one single categorical variable and that that would be good along the x-axis and you would see the difference is in how many in a bar pot? Great.  Not right. Sorry. Do you want to visualize the price of items over time? How would you do this?  Can I read a few seconds on this one?  3 2 1  I have to be at a lower percentage, but most of y'all said e line plot the second most common was scatterplot If This Were an exam, I wouldn't put scatter plot as an option because there's a viable Choice the best option would be in my pocket when you're looking at something overtime that is generally the visualization you would want if you have a quantitative number overtime, that is a line plot. I keep doing that wrong one. So what do you want to do to visualize the distribution of price for items in your data set? How would you accomplish that?  Price for an item. Sorry, that is a price for one.  The overall price for items in a dataset. Sorry. I'm a confused everybody.  Is it open?  That would be fine. Nobody's cooking and it's open now.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  so I'm going to 54% thing just popped a lower percentage here getting it, right. This is an example of a question where you need to put two pieces of information together that we learn to two different pictures. So it's a more difficult question than the ones we had just been doing because you first need to know how do you visualize price for items? And then you need to determine once you know what type of plot that is how you would do that with a function to actually fight in Python Santa here is that you would want a histogram or density plot and the function that does that is despot. So this is an example of one of your more difficult type question on the exam.  I have a few more you have a quantitative variable and you want to measure its central tendency. What would you use?  Think about it first and then chat with your neighbor.  Governor a few more seconds  3 2 1  I agree 63% of the class getting the correct answer.  It was explained to me you're thinking how did you know that mean was the answer here?  Question, what are the types of central tendencies that we talked about in class? There are three of them one was mean or the other two?  I heard the people medium. What's the third one?  Hertz on Hillside mode. I'm so this is a recall question. This doesn't apply the concept of hot what they mean is they says do you know that mean is a central tendency? So these are the types of recall questions that Donuts are they have you apply at this age? Did you learn the terms that we talked about?  I explode right now this which of the following is not a typical step in exploratory data analysis.  Think about yourself Freedom then try with your neighbor.  Give everybody a few more seconds.  3  2 1  all right. We have some some disagreements. This is an example of a tougher question. I because you now know that somebody agreed with your thought. I want you to tell me you're thinking and what you chose and why you chose it even if you end up being wrong. So why did you choose the answer you chose? How did you come to that one?  A lot of other people in the class. Also thought your answer was right.  So you won't be the only one to have thought an even if you're wrong. I do come to the choice you came to.  We all just randomly.  Now we had some thoughts. Right? Well, let's then have everybody chat with each other convince your neighbor of yours, and let's see if we can get to the right answer.  Will open it up again. So tired of each other convince your neighbor. Let's see if we can Converge on the right answer.  After this load of commands, we have lots of disagreement.  Can I get a few more seconds?  3  2  1  where was that much so  People who said checking for missingness. Does anybody want to explain to me why they chose that have a guess as to why you chose it? I'll tell you it's not the right answer.  All right. I think that your logic here may have been that that's a step in descriptive analysis. So it's not a step in exploratory data analysis, which is not true. This is when I went to clear up cuz I thought this and there may have been some confusion on this. So there are steps that you do a descriptive analysis. They also do an exploratory analysis suggested there in one doesn't mean you're not in another type of analysis sew-in in the process. I'm going to skip over B and you might guess why cuz that might be the right answers for the next two distributions of quantitative variables and visualizing relationship between variables biscuits at the heart of exploratory data analysis is you want to understand all of the variables you have in your date is that and how they relate to one another it is also a point in out identifying outlier values. You want to see it does anything stick out and did anything surprise you with anything beyond what you expected values for some variable way different than everybody else in the data said I'm so all of these are part of exploratory data analysis. Anybody want to explain to me why B is  Correct. Answer generally explanatory pause is not a typical staff in ETA.  I meant tell me how you would change that to make it true. It is something you do an ETA. Yeah.  Exploratory pause. Okay. So we spent a lecture just talking about how to generate basic class and then spend another day to visualization lecture talk about how to improve them. And the first day we talked about generating exploratory Park those quick pot that you generate to see what's going on with your data. And when you spend a lot of time are you right over the process really improve them and make them something you would show to your boss or send out in a company-wide email is an explanatory plot is one that you spend a lot of time on it is not what you would do during your quick eye duration an exploratory data analysis. Any questions on that now they've gone through it.  I think it's our last one. You want to quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables? What would you use to accomplish this?  think about it chapter neighbor  cuz I read a few more seconds.  3 2 1  the most everybody about this one, right? The answer is correlation. And this is what we used to by definition quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. So it's this is what we'll do this exercise the beginning of next to Exorcist help get you thinking about the types of questions that could be on the next exam to start reviewing topics to give you an idea of where you should focus your studying. So any questions on any of that before we move on  We're finishing up machine learning and then talking a bit about algorithms today. There's going to remind everybody to get you thinking back about what we talked about on Tuesday is that we talked about for basic steps to protection. We talked about the factory of the dataset often. You will split it into a train and gave us at this is what you used to build the model. The other remaining is your test at to check to see how accurate your model is in date of that weren't used to generate the model after touching your day that you can do feature selection determine what's going to be used to build remodel that can be in a supervisor to matter where you tell Addie model what will be part of the model or the computer can do an unsupervised fashion. We talked about General model selection. We didn't go into all the different types of models. You can use what we talked about regression and classification and decision trees. We talked about clustering. I know we talked about accuracy assessment. So if you are predicting a continuous variable, you can use rmse or root mean squared error where you would want that to be low cuz that means your predictions and what the truth is.  Are clothes you can also use just general Acura Acura see how many of the observations did you predict correctly that can be done for continuous or categorical data will talk about sensitivity and specificity which will talk about a little more an example. I'll go into that are just break down further of the accuracy. Those are the only then did a example where we look to see whether or not we could predict whether a house was in San Francisco or in New York City based on the characteristics of the house. And then we went there an example of Airbnb where you people gif images for the home that they want to listen Air B&B and Airbnb will organizers photos based on what they are verified that what the person said is there is actually there and they use a neural net to do that.  Okay, go out to see if I wanted to talk about was an example using the data. I have collected from you all so far in this course and my question is can I predict in this course will be successful data scientist. And of course you all students so we don't have to know the outcome. So I made that did up we'll get to that. So the question is what type of machine learning task is predicting y'all's made up success.  If a child with her neighbor, see what they're thinking.  Give everybody a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Alright, so we have some disagreement on this one. I'm going to tell you up front and then I want to see what you're thinking. Is that either B or C were the right answer. So who wants to explain why that's the case.  Is it true that you can tell me why you chose a cuz I can see you're thinking there.  how to determine a b or c with the option here  everything is quiet and sleepy today. That's alright. We'll have more options to answer at throughout the course today. So  The reason it's not regression is because this is already successful or not. I didn't make that explicitly clear so I can see why people chose regression. So if we were predicting a numeric regression would be a possibility but your options here are going to be either classification or clustering a cluster of people into successful. Successful, or he was a decision tree to determine who is in which group that's beagle of this exercise for the day that I had about you all in this room is that I have information from the roster. So this includes your name and your ID and what year you are in school and what major you are from that first service I sent out way back to the beginning of the course. I included some demographic information included in background knowledge on topics. We're going to cover in this course and your interest talked a little bit about your history historical and educational information another of those just for fun questions at the end remind you  How many siblings you had what your favorite color is what your favorite TV show was the make or survey only had a few questions. I had some information about who you are and then it had basically what you like or dislike about this course of the iclicker responses from every lecture. I had who answered what and the questions that were asked and then lastly I doing great. So I have your grades on the reading quizzes on the assignments and on the exam. So my question to you all is what date would you use out of this to predict to be a successful scientist and why and this is one I am going to make somebody answer so chat with each other get an answer. I'm not going to call in anybody, but you tell me what day does of these would you use and why the child each other?  Who is a thought of something that you could use to predict future success?  What would be most helpful from here? Do you think what's your guests make a hypothesis pick one?  Now there's an idea of what might be productive.  Percent of I clicker questions and what you're thinking there.  That's a reasonable hypothesis is that the percentage of iclicker questions of somebody answer might show that they're more engaged with the material and that might later on show that they are successful second thought that the hypothesis that is a valid hypothesis what other data would have similar possible effects, so we don't know but you might want to look at the effects of other data.  I took this more just looking at percentage of iclicker questions answered in our model anything else in there may be helpful. Yeah, but  The background knowledge might be helpful. If somebody already knows a lot about data science. They might choose not to come to class and then they would have a very low iclicker percentage and therefore could still be totally successful without ever having set foot in this classroom. And I think that is an also a really great hypothesis on a date in here that might be helpful to you want include both of those. That's a great answer. There's a both in great answer so far.  All right.  What day would you not telling each other which of these do you think would not be helpful or should not be used and why?  Alright, let's think about this. What would you not use for what reason? Yes.  United make per survey am I  Okay, so not everybody did the mid-course survey and might not be very representative of the course at large. So I would have some small subset. I like that thought.  Other thoughts. Yeah.  Okay, so they exclude most of the data in the master. It's just names in the class and we probably don't want to predict based on names for ethical reasons in general and it's not informative of future success success or it shouldn't be okay what it do you have other things on the roster that so that information of Oscar is Major and year in school.  Andrea stocks, that might be helpful  Set a timer for mission on the roster what else might need to not use to predict future success.  Anything in there that you think shouldn't be used?  We'll get back to that topic and the example.  So the deal with something like this, everybody's in Everett who responded is in a row the date I ended up using I had for 254 people and their 340 people in the class. We have that issue of whether or not this is actually representative, of course people have their responses as to what year they were in school with Pat and I use a lot of the data from the just for fun section that you probably wouldn't use if you are actually trying to protect people success, but you also wouldn't make up people's success if you are actually doing this. So I use a number of variables these red ones are from the survey so you can see that I try to see if having a pet with predictive is number of siblings. I use your college major from the roster but not your names and then I used your grade on the first exam and then I made up an exam grade for the course so that last one is just a made-up datapoint.  I don't want to head and I predicted thought your success factors determine whether or not something with success success yes or no and I hears all of the made upgrades that I made up for all of the people in the state of that. So the idea is can I from these features that I have selected predict whether or not somebody is successful Ariana same page as to what we're doing here and your questions.  Terrific teachers. I'm going to determine whether or not somebody is successful.  Where did this what I broke it out into the data partitioning. So I took those 254 people. I took 70 individuals at random and put them in the training date of it. And then I took a 30% and put that in the testing data set and I trailer models of all those features I talked about I put those in and said which of those can predict whether or not somebody successful. So in the training day that they know that it model knows whether or not somebody was successful.  And this was what I got out. So I want you to chat with your neighbors and tell me what you think is being described in this date. Is that so what are the axios? What is the trend? What are we supposed to take away from this? So take a book chat with each other?  I don't want to explain what we're looking at here. What is this chart displaying?  What does listed on the side here?  Hey, buddy.  The variables are working on Sundays are the features in the model and then what's on the x-axis we have I'll just read it since it's your relative influence on model. The idea is the larger the Barbie larger that variable is influencing the model. So not everything is going to influence predictions equally so maybe pet is not as protective of success as a high school GPA. So right now the things that are contributing the most to our model are high school GPA and grade so that's grade in poznan that I made up for everybody.  So about this model, we have our training data and then we can test it. Remember we held back 30% of the data set. And now we have a model where we can use that mathematical representation saying build a using that model. We just give it to do data see what it predicts so predicts in the test that so then we train a model here and knows who was successful. He was not here we use the model built over here and predicted in this test at where we don't tell the computer who was successful or not. That's how we're doing after we've done all of this. So it's our model one more thing about accuracy. Who do we guess right model was only as accurate is a random. Guess what what are models accuracy be?  What do we have to do better than to say we're doing better than random.  Feel free to chat with each other.  Give her a few more seconds.  3 2 1  I'm at 60% said that the answer was 50% and this is true. This is the case because if I would have randomly assigned all of you either yes or no and success. I have a fifty-fifty chance of getting it right in order for this prediction to be better than random. It has to be more accurate than a fifty-fifty guess. So I then calculate now that I've built the model I now know what the labels were in each of them so I can say in the Trinity to how well did their model do and then in a testator how low their model do so accuracy is just what percentage of individuals were protected predicted correctly and sensitivity specificity start to break down further. So all of those who were truly successful what percent were predicted to be successful and over here on those that were not successful what percentage were not predicted to not be successful. So these are just breakdowns on to explain what's going on with accuracy a little further.  I just always thought and our training data. So 71.2% of the time the model I built was right and that was driven more by the people who are successful cuz that's tiffy's higher than those that were not successful that's busy. So we're getting those who were successes right more often than we're getting those who were not successes. All right. So and so far we have 72 in 471 percentage accuracy and it is that where it was a model that was not built on these data. The accuracy is 49.1% and its sensitivity is 40% and is specificity 60% better job guessing those who were not successes, but my question to you is is this a good predictive model.  every few more seconds  3 2  1  All right. We are pretty evenly split amongst the class of who wants to defend their position. Why do you say yes, maybe or no?  What song is good is not really a quantitative? It's hard to determine whether or not something is good, which is why I put the temperature expected in here so we could discuss this.  Everyone is expendable.  Can you said no because of the test at the accuracy is less than 50 and we said for this to be worth anything. We have to be a both 50% on accuracy. So really at the low in the 50% in the test that we're not even as good as random guesses. So I think that is a great conclusion from that one. So will table this discussion for now cuz I'm going to show another example using similar data so accurate there in a test that so we want to try and improve that so what if I added some additional feature, so I'm going to use everything I used before for then add back in ethnicity and gender and see tenae now predict who is successful idiot. We're just using more features in our model.  Now I do this and we have the same breakdown weeks to have a data partition when I train the data over here suddenly all the things that were previously contributing to our model are not and being driven by ethnicity and gender is broken down and I broken down so that it is either Asian or other. So everybody was agent is among other is another this is just to do it differently than how it's done in science. What's the time where it's white and other and then here it is a gender the only two categories ever including these data were male and female.  And those are the two that are driving the model.  And when I go and check accuracy sensitivity and specificity here, I see that we're doing a really good job predicting who's going to be successful and I am doing it well in a training dataset and the test question to you is is this a good predictive model.  Tell each other anything.  Gary few more seconds  3 2 1  I look very similar to the last one. But I imagine people maybe pics an answer differently than they did on the last one. So good predictive model. I think if you said yes, you were probably thinking this is a super accurate model. So it is a good predictive model. I don't even people who said know what his thoughts as some people who said no, it's not a good predictive model.  Yes.  The two new variable that allow bonfires give other salsa Powell or what that would mean. If this were in the model is a tough question put on the spot.  So what would this mean? If so, I'll tell you right now for the way the model ran it predicted that asian females were successful while other people were not.  What would that reflect of the society if that were true?  I got.  So we're using historic day today that happened in school and we were using demographic data and the information that came out of her model to be productive was that asian females went on to be successful and other people did not with that would reflect to me. If I saw those data were that in the people I got hired happened to the asian females and it likely had nothing to do with their courses at UCSD and nothing to do with the instruction. They got it was just that these people went on it to get hired.  So my question to you is what if I look at these data and then determined that I should only right light recommendation letters for asian females and nobody else or I should only focus my attention on and look at projects from individuals. Who where is a female? Cuz I know that's the only people that go on to be successful with only read aloud, then those people to come to office hours or only allowed UCSD Majors to be data science Majors who are asian females.  Show me the types of things you should always be thinking about in your predictive models. What will they be used for? So I would argue hear that last Model was not a good one because it only represented historical bias. He's in the day. Write the data only showed who got hired not who is successful and attributes that had to do with that. So I would say ethnicity and gender shouldn't be in that model at all. And the first one was not accurate either because the test that was lower than 50% so we weren't doing better than random chance when we add an ethnicity and gender Stanley were predicting correctly, but it doesn't actually mean anything and is not a good predictive model and one that should be used going forward. There's always think about what your model reviews for what you're trying to answer and what your goal is in doing that.  Any questions on that example before we get to the algorithm section?  All right eye because we're going to have videos for the end. I'm going to give everybody like 30 seconds to a minute to talk about anything before I go do this and I want every detention like through the end cuz I know it'll be tough. All right, so you're 30 seconds to a minute to yourself and then Focus back in for algorithm.  Metairie so tired today don't even chatting.  I had a little bit of time clear my eyes now. We're focusing threats that I'm thinking about algorithms. So my jackets are you are not to know how to build an algorithm not know the steps behind it. But to understand what an algorithm is and the relationship between algorithms and how decisions are made and to discuss how to ethically approach algorithmic development.  Set it up fine. And algorithm. It is a finite set of rules that if followed precisely defined a sequence of operations that solve the problem.  In a finite number of steps. So what I'm saying here is if your algorithm is a number ordering Alder than if I give you a bunch of numbers, you would want us at the steps that would get those numbers in numerical order. So you could take the first number and I see is the next number bigger than it and if it is leave it and if not move it before and then move to the next one and determine if that is bigger than the next one because ultimately this might take a really long time since that another possible algorithm would be to take a few chunks of the numbers and then see if you can get those small chunks in number order and then see how those fit into other ones usual different eye duration on algorithms. I could get your numbers that in order some more efficient than others. I would do it if you are steps. So if the best out of them would be the one that accomplishes the goal efficiently and does it as efficiently as possible. So you want to always accomplish the goal and when to do it in a few steps  A shorter definition of algorithm is a series of Define steps for solving a problem. They have to be clear. You have to think of all the things that could go wrong. So for example of a Zircon edge cases if you were doing the number, I told me I hand you a data set and I tell you to put it into my no mericle order. What is Italy in the middle that there was an A the letter A how would you handle that? If you didn't expect that to be running wouldn't know where to put a relative to all the other numbers. So you're building an algorithm you first have to think what all the things that can go wrong. What are all the edge cases are there letters is everything I have here actually numeric and then you start the steps. Once you're confident that the data are where you want them to be to actually solve the problem. So you need us to find set of steps that takes into account all the things that could go wrong and accomplish your task and does it in his few steps as possible.  Okay, the way I'm going to talk about algorithms is to walk you through an actual company and the algorithm they use a show of hands who has heard of Stitch fix.  very few people  So that is totally fine. You don't even know anything about this lyrics to know and talk about this. So Stitch fix put out a algorithms tour to describe what they do at their company and data science is woven into the fabric of Stitch fix is for anybody who doesn't know it is a company that started as a tech startup and has grown at is incredibly popular now and I did that people don't have time or don't enjoy shopping but what clothes that fit them and that are stylish and fit their style. So it helps his hits work is a user sits in front of a computer tell Stitch fix something about them. And what kind of clothing are looking for and it's Stitch fix mail them a box of clothing that is supposed to be design and specifications for their body type and their style and then you as a user get to decide if you want to keep everything or if you want to keep a few pieces if you keep a few pieces you pay just for those and send everything else back there is some incentive for keeping the whole box and that's how they try to increase what you keep. Okay?  questions about what the company is, generally  So albertans are throughout their entire company. So to reach their goal of getting clients clothing perfect for them without them having to do the work. They had algorithms at every single step through the walk-through with their tour a little bit and explain what happens. So they use recommendation systems, which were going to talk about those briefly and human computation and Resource Management inventory manager Alberta fashion design. These are all the things were going to walk through briefly as we talked about the entire Stitch fix process.  The number of different pieces of data so you sit down at the computer and you tell the company something about you and your sex they have all that data. They also have all the data about their clothing. They have this whole Warehouse of inventory and they need to know what color it is what style it is. What kind of piece of clothing is what material it is whether or not the patterner different color and so they have all of that information about their inventory information about you their client information about the clothing and they have all the feedback you give them overtime. So if you died is this is a subscription so you would get a they call it is fixed fixed and every month you would get a new fixed and you give feedback each time about what pieces you like what you did it and why they've information to give them up front they have what you keep overtime if they have the information of the clothing and then all of the feedback you've ever provided the company and there's a lot to do. So the first step is in our room as soon as you go to their site. They're going to start collecting information about you going to tell them when you want you  What date and there's an algorithm that determines what the first possible that you could get it based on location is an algorithm is used to prepare. The calendar is a pretty simple one. So you start out you tell them where you are and when you want your face and they determine what date it would be possible. So that's where it is the simplest and it gets more complex from there. So we're going to walk through these steps in their process. We're going to talk about Warehouse assignment then the recommendation systems. How do they determine what clothing should be sent to you matchmaking how you get matched with your stylist the aspect of human computation that goes into this and then a bit about logistics optimization so we can walk through each of those Warehouse assignment you live somewhere and you are going to stitch fix to get a box of clothing. So say you live here.  District has five different warehouses. So there's some optimal function that you can determine mathematically. You don't need to know any of the functions. I'm still here just conceptually what they are describing. So here there is you and there is some cost to ship into the box and that cost differs depending on where the warehouse is. We also can't just go with cost only because if the inventory that you are the client would need isn't at the warehouse you needed that shouldn't be your math Warehouse. So they're going to combine the shipping time and the inventory match and the cost of shipping from each of the locations and determine that for you where your clothing should come from and remember it's not just you it's everybody in the country who are their clients. So they're going to do this for every individual. That's what you're showing over here. Each individual has a different calculation for shipping cost shipping time and inventory match and you're going to get a number for each different Warehouse that describes how much it would cost for a dime to get the fix to you. So, this is Holocaust major.  Matrix because their rows and columns and numbers in it  So they calculate this for every individual across all of the warehouses. You got this cost Matrix and then it becomes was known as a binary optimization problem binary means two choices. So what they're saying here is where is the number lowest for each individual over this individual the number with lowest for Texas? So their boss is going to come from Texas. The second person is going to come from California and the third is going to come from Wisconsin the math that goes into just figuring out what shipping where your fix would ship from  We go through a number of recommendation system after we figure out where your clothing is going to come from. That's what clothing should actually be sent to you.  So there's a list of the inventory and in that list is ranch for what you might like to what you wouldn't like and then you're going to remove styles that the client has said that they don't want anyone that they've already received it only send somebody to peace twice.  Original approach to recommending clothing uses lots of inputs to lots of different data and multiple models and it takes all the information together and they're going to come up with some likelihood that a particular client would love that style. So ultimately want some single measure of each piece of clothing and you want to determine what How likely the client is to love that style.  It's the way they do. This is something called collaborative filtering. You don't even know what time about that, but they predict based on what others similar to you have liked historically and what you have liked. So if you have gotten a box over time, they're going to keep track of what you have like and what you had in like they're all going to say who were in their database. Are you most similar to and they're going to recommend based on who you're most similar to and because there's lots of missing data and that's where they're going to fill in based on what other people similar to have liked. So they're going to use explicit. So what you as a client has said you like and also the attributes of the clothing you have liked and that you said you wouldn't like and then fill it in with stuff that comes information that comes from other clients similar to you. So using information where you said you liked as well as important information that has been taken from other similar to you.  And then I'm going to follow this overtime. So they're not just going to do the model once and a time at this point in time. What is best for you? They're going to do this each time. You give them feedback and it stays when you are doing something over time. It is just want you to know data. If it is just an example is that you could use mixed effects modeling. So so far we've learnt used see that they're using tons of different algorithms in their approach to get a person a single box of clothing.  Ready to talk about the fact that there is other additional information that could be included here. So you've text Data what the feedback they said was and you also have photographic information based on somebody's Pinterest profile which you can give to stitch fix they can say what clothes did you pin and what do we have in our inventory that are most similar to that? So all of this is still talking about the recommendation system. This is an example of how they would use images. So a pinned image that the client likes and an image of a clothing in the inventory. This is similar to what you saw last lecture about machine learning. There's a neuron that they use and ultimately they get a measure of how similar to this object is to this object and they're going to select stuff from their inventory that has high similar to stuff that people already said they like  We talked about the text. So this is feedback that the client is getting six packs and they can use natural language processing to figure out what is being conveyed in this without a single human having to read that text.  The warehouse assignment we talked about minimizing the cost and where the clothing are and shipping we didn't talk about recommendation systems. So they have lots of algorithms are going to this that incorporate how to use the text that the person has provided images on their Pinterest profile what they have said they like what they are others similar to them have said that they like and then taking this into account overtime. So is it a lot the recommendation system is the most complex part of their company.  I haven't made explicitly clear is that after all of that work to determine what clothing are most likely to make it's not just computers that are deciding ultimately what gets sent in the Box all of that was done. So that that information can go to an actual human stylist at Silas is ultimately who's going to decide what gets sent to the client.  And their argument is a human-sized are going to be better suited to some clients. So you can just give them a random stylist. You have to have some process of taking an individual and what they need and The Stylist and what their style is and who they best serve and matching them up. So they use an algorithm to do that. So that's what they called matchmaking figure out who your individual stylist should be and you can't just match based on who you're a stylist would be accustomed stylist would have time to talk to clients and wouldn't have room to take on more. This is very similar to the warehouse problem where you have to figure out who is available and who is the best matchup who is available? But he's a very similar process to Warehouse assignment to do that.  And this probably looks similar to that first one. I showed where you are trying to figure out who the best client would be of who is available.  The warehouse assignment how to get the box and where it should come from recommendation system how we rank the clothes based on all of the information that decline has given at others have given and a matchmaking. How do we figure out that we have all the data who should be match with this client to make the ultimate decision.  Now where did that aspect of human computation? This should sound similar to something case piccininni said is that what we're doing human computation hear the idea is the stylist who is not a data scientist will be looking at the information on a computer screen and they have to make decisions. The goal would be for them to make the best decision so that your client buys as many pieces as possible and you want your client your stylus to be able to do this in as quick a fashion as possible so that they can do this for life and let people see you need the system that they're looking at to be as efficient as possible. You don't want them to have to collect a lot of different places. You don't want it to be hard for them to figure out what information is there are data scientists testing out doing a b testing to determine what is the way that we can best show The Stylist the information for them to make a decision. So that's where she comes in. How do we get the people to accept the most clothing and pay for it? And how do we make it be easiest on the Silas to accomplish that?  The last one now, we got the whole process we know where the box is going to come from. We know what clothing they're most likely to like we know which Stylus is going to choose that for them. We know how the status is going to do that by looking at the platform that this is working on. The last one is logistics optimization. How are you going to get those pieces that are stored in the warehouse from the warehouse into that box that you're going to send off but a lot of logistics go in there that go in their suit imagine there. Lots of possible route that you can take in the warehouse and there was a different combinations of which clothing could be picked. And so you're trying to make that as optimal for all of the clothing that has to be picked on that day. Is that overtime Baltimore talk about logistics optimization not going to talk about the details of that.  Then that was all of what goes on to get a single box to a human the human then tries it on and provide that feedback that I've been talking about. So all of that was to get there in a single box of clothing and ideas. They then try that on and they determine whether or not they like it. So there's clothing going from the warehouses to the clients and I'm back from the clients back into warehouses of what they didn't want. That's all they determined by all of this data we've been talking about where the information is going into the stylist and the warehouse and through the warehouse where the information is coming from. Where will be shipped.  And then between Stitch fix algorithms and the clients, there's lots of feedback being provided all of this is coded by weather mats feedback the notes from The Stylistics elections that were made the chicken that was requested the client's data or Warehouse assignment so you can see that data are really at the core of everything of Stitch fix and if you want to look at more details on this that tour is what I've been describing but there are more details in the tour online.  Okay, so I talked about all of how we get it from a warehouse into a client's hands and if they identified on there lots of other algorithm that Stitch fix we haven't even begun to discuss. So how do they determine what to keep in stock where to put that how to develop new style so they developed their own new Styles based on trends that they are anticipating are going to happen to they need to have a clothing line. That's not to try and hit not three months after that to determine when shipment demand will be higher do people want more clothing around holidays. Do they want more clothing at the beginning of the year at the end of the year around their birthday. This is bees are all algorithms that are determined at Stitch fix beyond the ones we've already talked about.  Okay, so I just went through a whirlwind of Stitch fix algorithms. You don't need to know any of the specific algorithms that districts uses but I want you to see that a lot of these texts start up their algorithm that are built in from the beginning Inception of their company and then use throughout every step and then they're optimized and changed over time.  Which means that we have a number of algorithmic considerations that we need to make so I'm going to show three videos that first one is short and I want you while you're listen to think about why it is that I'm showing it to you in just a minute.  Ikea the architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched. It's super real and it's happening around you feel it yet know that is worthless start. Sorry.  A new style elevator called destination control elevators everybody going to whatever color they want everybody.  To the 10th floor goes into car to everybody wants and freaked out and you see what it's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation like the button.  I like the things that people used as is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says stop.  And this is what we're designing for. We're designing for this kind of machine.  Try to show you this video get an elevator elevator, especially in super big building where you walk up before you even get to get to say which for you're going to and it tells you which elevator of the options to get into and then you get in there and hope that you're going to the right spot.  So don't worry about it is now going to deciding which door you should go step into and it's a set of steps to finding that.  What's the point of this video?  So the point is you can write with their software. They know somebody had to her. Yeah.  Yeah, okay, so people forgot when things change and it's your job when you're running out of urine to determine how much of the Freak Out 2 weeks after I can people adapt to things over time. There are things that technology we use now that when we first use we have no idea and now a very intuitive people might freak out and it might be okay cuz they're going to adapt and I freaked out and it might not be okay cuz I might never get used to the fact that they have no control in the elevator when you're running out of things. You have to adopt you and think about what I said before that an algorithm should be efficient and solve the problem that is still true have to do it correctly an ethically which will talk about in a second and a half to do in a way that humans. Don't freak out where they do that. They can adapt or there some way to mitigate their freaking out this so their rooms all over UCSD that has two thermostats in them and people will go and it just a minute. Absolutely nothing but it doesn't change the temperature in the room at all. But people feel better when they get to change them. There is even a room at my last institution where in the room that had added a second third.  Is that in the room and neither thermostat did anything so there's one that existed for a really long time and it didn't work and I think he'll complain so I think they put in the second one to make people feel better change the temperature in the room. So I wouldn't say that you should waste your time designing things that sell wall that don't actually do anything. But you do have to think about as you're generating algorithms whether or not she was going to freak out cuz it's way different than what they're used to so I'll be able to be adopted by humans or the system of humans are involved and their accompanying you write a new algorithm. If it doesn't work with the rest of it already exists, it's worthless. So you have to make sure that can be adapted by either the human organ system. What does minimal struggle as possible?  Okay, this next one is a few minutes longer. So think about what it is telling you and why I'm showing it.  Oh, I'm sorry. I really thought it was from Kevin slavin. He is a entrepreneur and he works in New York City. The rest of that video is about algorithmic trading and not about elevators at all. So if you want to learn more about our in the training, this one is from a professor at Carnegie Mellon computer science and engineering Professor here at Carnegie Mellon and my research focuses on usable privacy and security and so do my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with Computing systems, especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security.  Two passwords are something that I hear a lot about a lot of people are frustrated with passwords. And you know, it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to gas. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems?  It's tough.  A Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our password right people are laughing cuz we don't actually have different passwords for everything and most people do really bad job with passwords. Okay. Continue.  Shoe requirement up through 2009 was just that you had to have a password with at least one character pleasing but then they changed since that we were going to have a new policy and this new policy required passwords that were at least 8 characters long with an uppercase letter lowercase letter. You couldn't use the same character more than three times and it wasn't allowed to be in the dictionary new policy. A lot of people my colleagues and friends came up to me and they said wow, that's really unusable. Why are they doing this to us? Why didn't you stop them and I can point you know what they didn't ask me but I got curious and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy and they said that the university had joined a Consortium of universities and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that  Clyde with some new requirements and these requirements were that are passwords had to have a lot of entropy entropy is a complicated term. But basically it measures the strength of passwords. But the thing is there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy the National Institute of Standards and technology has a set of guidelines which kind of some rules of thumb for measuring entropy, but they don't have anything specific and the reason that they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords and that there are reports States. Unfortunately, we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules. This would like to obtain more data on the password users actually choose but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others. So this this is a problem but our research group looked at it as an opportunity. He said well, there's a need for good password data. Maybe we can collect some good.  Password data and actually Advance the state-of-the-art here. So the first thing we did is we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and I talked to students faculty and staff and ask them for information about their passwords that we didn't say give us your password. Now wait, we just ask them about their password? How long is it? Does it have a digit? Does it have a symbol? And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week?  So we got results from 470 students faculty and staff and indeed we confirm that the new policy was very annoying. But we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down and only 13% of them did but disturbingly 80% of people said they were reusing their password. Now, this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down because it may makes you much more susceptible to attackers. So if you have to write your passwords down, but don't worry.  We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So seeing you last 32 possible symbols, but as you can see, there's only a small number that most people are using so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords. So, this is a really interesting study and now we had data from 470 people but in the scheme of things, that's really not very much password.  All right. So what's the take-home here? She goes on to say that they did more experiments. They work with on Mechanical Turk. So these are people that online you can ask them to do a task so that she had them create passwords for this task under different conditions and then look to see what passwords they created which were the most secure and then they went and use all the up-to-date hacking techniques to determine all of the passwords that were created which were most effective way to take homes. Is that a long set of words and there's an XKCD cartoon about this is better. So if you have just four different words that's better than something shorter and more complicated. So what is all of this getting at? What is the take-home message here where I want you all to learn from this.  What did you learn from it?  Tell each other thing about what the take-home is.  What did you learn? What do I want you to learn from this?  Alright, what's something you learned and or what? You think I want you to have learned?  Focus on real quick thoughts as to what you are. You totally keep talking as long as you're answering my question out loud.  Great selection of this is that it's a very it's a great system when it comes to machines, but it says unusable system when it comes to humans because they're annoyed and because they're annoyed. They then don't handle their passwords correctly. They either as a result of their annoyance use the same one over and over again or write them down. So I system can be great for a computer and bad for humans and humans are using it. That's a problem and let her take homes or things you learned.  I got a bunch of you. Thought I'll man the only character I use in mind as an! Because clear this with the data show idea here. Is that systems when you're designing them for humans have to be done with humans in mind and that's a vagina for ease-of-use and this is a similar concept as what we talked about with the elevator example and ideas that users can routinely and automatically applied a protection mechanism correctly. So that was wanting to take him that we didn't get to is that as long as you give people a carrot? So do you have those strength on the password that incentivizes people to make better password? It doesn't sanitize making them use a different one from one to the other but they did is at the mental image of protection goes much must match the mechanisms they have to use and it's under the bottom here with the average user thinks they are doing is with actually being done. So it doesn't matter if you have 32 characters and capital letters and lowercase letters of people are actually using that it doesn't make your system any more secure. So I'll go there rooms are actually doing whatever is being done by the people using it not what you see.  Rightly think could happen. All right. So this last bit is I know Sandra's and this was importance of this is a part of a dataframe podcast, which is a podcast about data science and it comes from the company datacamp. This is an author of an awesome book called weapons of mass destruction and it's a book talking about how we use algorithms in the world and harm people which is something we shouldn't do. So I'm going to play a few minutes from this one.  as she explains what a weapon of mass destruction is  could you tell me what kind of the basic ingredients of what a weapon of mass destruction actually is  sharab weapon of mass destruction is is it kind of algorithms that I feel we're not wearing enough about is important and it's secret and its destructive. Those are the three characteristics important important. I mean, it's widespread. It's scale that uses a lot of people for important decisions. I usually think of the categories of decisions in the following like financial decision. So it could have been a credit card or insurance or housing or livelihood decisions. Like do you get a job do you keep your job? Are you good at your job? Do you get a raise or Liberty? So, how are you police? How are you sentenced to prison? How are you getting parole your actual Liberty Island in the fourth category would be information. So how are you fed?  Information, how is your environment online a particular informed through algorithms? And what kind of long-term effects are the others having on different parts of the population. So those are the four categories. They're important. One of the things that I absolutely insist on when we talk about weapons of math destruction or algorithms or regulation in particular is that we really focusing on important algorithms. There's just too many algorithms to worry about so we have to assume triage and think about which one's actually matter to people and then the second thing is that they're secret almost all of these are secret even people don't even know that they just never mind understand how they work. And then finally they're making important Secrets Visions about people's lives and the fuck up like they make mistakes and its destructive for that individual who doesn't get the opportunity or the job or the credit card or the Housing Opportunity or they get in prison too long. I'm so it's destructive for them. But as an observation and  Go back to the secret group sang different individual, but it actually took of undermines the original goal of the algorithm and creates a destructive feedback loop at on this level of society. Okay, so there's a lot more in that podcast just a bit interested in hearing more about her about dating sites in general is a good podcast to check out to the categories that were mentioned there and I didn't swear on the podcast she did so it doesn't count. I think I still haven't done that yet. Okay, so important secret and destructive are the three categories this happen to me just last night. I have a friend who's a federal prosecutor and she reached out to me because I'm also a geneticist and she said there's this evidence that are in is in my tile. I don't know anything else about the trial because she's a federal prosecutor and you don't get to know those things. But she said, do you know how this works? And I said, I know it's from a company and I know its proprietary but don't know how it works. And so it's been reporting the case is that some individual is 1 + 1 trillion times more likely to be that individual the DNA coming from that individual events on The Stranger.  Her question to be as well how much more similar is it? True that person and the relative. So the relative was also at the crime scene and these two people DNA are similar. It doesn't matter what the hell difference from a stranger putting that one person at the crime scene doesn't mean that was actor that person if your relative to another stranger, so she asked me like what do you know about this out for them? And I was like, I don't because they keep everything under lock and key and they specifically don't make it publicly available those important because somebody could be put in jail based on these data and it's so that makes it distracted and important and it also makes it a secret because I asked geneticist despite having an outage to tell her what's going on don't know what's his it approaches are actually using in their data. The one of the approaches to dealing with this is that evidence should be fat so they should be fair accountable and transparent and those are bare minimum an algorithm to be fair accountable and transparent and still be a bad algorithm questionnaire.  Transparency, isn't it been something that somebody can create on their own and answer is yes, so then it cut into profits is the idea right? So I think the problem here is that if you are affecting people in a destructive way, this is where it applies the most. So if you are going to be asked in a court of law or you're going to be harming people as a result of the potential for harm than it has to be transparent and that is not common practice in today's world. So yes, if you open up that has a case to do this to get DNA example, I just gave there is a competitor of that company who has similar accuracy but has chain has opened up their algorithm due to all the backlash they've gotten as to whether or not it should be admissible in court and they are there is even when you make a transparent and people have the code attorneys and lawyers and judges don't have the knowledge that then figure out even what's going on you need an extra fee on that. So if it comes to a company and you're making money and you're not harming people  Just being destructive in its its proprietary. It's yours and it's making you money, but I think if you are having the opportunity to harm somebody or have found the difference, then you have to apply to these that is both are accountable and transparent because that is the argument companies use when they are harming people to not share their algorithms.  That's a great question though. Okay with that. I will see you all next week.  sandiego.edu "
