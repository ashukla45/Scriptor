    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast. And everyone will get started.  Great to see all of you again here today. I have a few reminders every to get settled to register your iclicker on Triton head the vast vast majority of you have register iclicker. I'm so this only applies to a few of you reminding you of your reading quiz do Monday and number if you have already submitted largely people are doing well on this you guys shouldn't have the grades yet, but I can take a look at them tonight and I'll be released you within a week after their due and then complete the course survey. This isn't really helpful to me about a third of you have finished it so far and it helps me see where everybody is in their current understandings that I can see where to focus on the course going forward. It also provides me the date of that. I said we use throughout the course so I can demonstrate the principles of data science things. Here are no discussion section this week. You will start up Monday and we'll be discussing that first reading infection. I'm office hours are on for this week in case anybody's feeling around or law for his questions are confused.  Go to my office hours. You can go to the TA zoraiz office hours. I have a number of questions about whether or not people who are on the waitlist had access to try an ad and it was confirmed that you do not have access in here at the post. I've accessed I have absolutely no control of the waitlist as I learned. So if you have any questions, you can always reach out to cogs advising UCSD. Edu. So it's ugs advising. If you have any questions about your possibility of getting off the waitlist or when that would happen.  Philly things everyone was added to Beyonce yesterday. So if you do not have access to Piazza you should so let me know reading quizzes just reiterating you have one shot and they are not timed and if you have trouble finding it, it's on Trainor net under content you would then click on readings and if you would click on that first link to take the quiz in there, so it's a r1m. What is a design?  The first assignment I did have a question on whether or not there be any programming on that assignment and there is not there won't be any programming on the assignments until assignment 2 and you'll have time to practice in section to get a handle on the type of programming that's expected of you to know what that point. We'll be doing demonstrations of programming in lecture. You'll have time to practice you have time to ask questions in section you had access to the first assignment starting Monday.  And then we will use iclicker today. I had a question of whether or not you have to answer them correctly and answer is no it is just participation. So what you say, it doesn't really matter. It's really often for me to get a sense of what you guys are thinking. So answer to the best of your ability, but you won't be marked for the extra credit. That's what I'm not you were right.  Any other questions on logistical stuff?  Okay, this was so I thought I should last time and I made an error. So I had flipped left the room to all of these were wrong what it says on your schedule is correct. So if you were looking at this lad initially my apologies any how to make a mistake, I will do my best to correct it as soon as possible also has changed his office hours to Tuesday 1 to 2 p.m. We'll always updated and announce it on Piazza Whenever there are changes will do our best not to change these that you can have some consistency but our schedule to change from time to time and also had to take both right here. So the Bulls or the place, I made a mistake on this slide. My apologies any questions there.  All right section touching a number you have emailed me. I am going to email everybody back individually to let you know if you have are able to have a section you switch to at this point every is emailed me will be able to switch but I will confirm that by email to make numbers a little easier this point forward. There's a good chance depending on where you are that you will not be able to switch unless you want to switch out of the Monday at 4 p.m. Section or into the Wednesday at 5 p.m. Section. Feel free to email me. I'll do my best to accommodate but I can't have any tari2 overload it.  The only thing before we jump into today's topic that I want to discuss is the fact that the paper that I've assigned is blank see it can be confusing at times and I as an undergraduate didn't have a ton of experience reading primary literature and I felt like that what is a deficit as I moved on. So I wanted to introduce you all to papers as soon as possible while realizing that they can be tough and challenging. So I want to just briefly say that while you're reading through this make sure they are thinking about what your understanding of why you're not understanding those things that you're not understanding those are questions to ask during C-section and you want to know something about what you agree with what degrees would think that you've been telling other courses, there are things taught differently in different fields. So you want to be thinking critically about how this fits into what you've learnt elsewhere how this fits into what you think and what you believe to be true and or what's confusing you can then look that up you can discuss it in section and also always think about the idea is that it gives you this could be an idea for a project.  Something you could research later in another course or just for your own interests. So try to be thinking about these sorts of things while you're going through this and all the reading  All right, a lot of a lot more than I planned to have for most days before we get to the main topic. I'm today. We're going to discussing ethics and privacy.  I know is an undergraduate and graduate student that discussing ethics was often a boring topic. I would say and data science and there are plenty people were at the office and do not think it is boring. And that is awesome for me. This is one of the most important topics. That's why I'm starting it in the beginning of course and data science courses Austin at 6 is the last lecture. So it's when you are all studying for finals when you are all less likely to be here or when you were thinking about your final exams, and I really think that's a detriment to us all going for it because this is one of the most important topics and something we should be considering in all of our work.  Okay, so we want to determine how data scientist can address at the concerns and maximize privacy. That's our goal today. I'm going to start with in a clicker questions also talk whatever to get them out anytime at the clicker question. It'll have this little blue symbol up in the top right on the slide is a slightly different color, but you can't tell on this projection projector. So maybe I'll change that to a even more distinct color in today. The clicker questions we're going to be doing each of them twice will do one in the beginning and then we'll come back at to the at the end to see if your thoughts have changed all then look at the data and show you guys if you've changed throughout the lecture. Yes.  Great question. Okay clicker should be tuned to a d if you forget it's over there for those of you on that side of the room. So yeah, you should be tuned to a d.  Write the first question in this is just opinion. I'll open it up in a second. It's not yet open is that the data have been freely shared on the Internet? It's okay to use them for my data science or research project.  Okay should be open.  I don't close it in 5 seconds.  at 3 to 1  Alright. Alright, let's take a look at the results here. So my screen to somewhere that's better for me.  So you can see all the view. It's a somewhat agree who wants to defend their position now, but I want you to keep thinking about this position cuz I'm going to ask you again when we come back to this at the end of the lecture. I just want to see this as our initial Impressions before we discuss the ins-and-outs of data size ethics.  The next one will do three here.  That's one takes a little bit of explaining. So if you're familiar with companies like 23andMe or with ancestry.com many people are sitting through a tube and then getting information about their ancestry. Sometimes their arguments that these genetic databases should be giving access to all this data to policing bodies so that if a criminal is suspected they can better tie to it. This issue is that if you submit your data to these databases it gives you information about your family members. So the person whose data are not in the genetic database you can still find information about them through their family members the weather or not. You have given access genetic basis. Should that be given to police and bodies when they policing like the police when attempting to identify a criminal  Saul open that up.  All right, I'll close it in 5 seconds.  at 3 to 1  All right. So the most popular songs with the same here, but by a smaller margin, so most of you said that you somewhat agree with this.  All right, the last one for now before we get into the topics is the following. How do you how much do you agree with the fact that social media and online retailers should be allowed to experiment on their users.  All right, I'll close it in three two one. So here we have a pretty even split do people strongly disagree or agree, but we're pretty even on the neutral to I might agree or I might describe I said this one is one. We're going to walk through in detail today, and we'll see how to refill down by Dan does lecture.  Okay.  Sorry Panic everyday thinking I didn't turn it on. So I did cuz if you can hear me, okay, give me a few minutes overtime. But the rate at which state are being generated is increasing at an increasing rate. So while in 2011 we had five billion eggs every two days and now we have 5 million in 2015 every 10 seconds. And that's even increasing before to a greater rate. Now where there is what your boss for your company wants you to do what can be done legally what you're allowed to do that the government tells you to do and then there's I'm done technically these degree in the Blu Dash in the black circles all overlap each other in some way and that we have to somehow find where the ethical position is in the middle of it. Cuz there is certainly more that you can do technically that is right to do their things that your boss. May I ask you to do in the future.  That you should not do and it's sometimes difficult to push back against them but it's good to have some working principle in the beginning so that you know in which situations you should push back and you should always do what's legal. I'm so someone in the middle of that we have is ethical position. The problem is that ethics is defined by moral principles that govern our behavior and how we conduct an activity. They're not the law. It's not always so clear where the line is between right and wrong.  So that brings us to this quote from IBM where they say that big data and analytics technology can reap huge benefits to both individuals and organizations. So there are lots of things that we can do. We can personalize their service. We can really Target who we want to reach and makes it at the product fits them. Well, we can detect Fraud and Abuse which is certainly a good thing cuz we don't want Fraud and Abuse to permeate and we can use our resources efficiently. So then why are there questions being raised about the ethics of analytics? All right. Well, we're going to walk through a few examples. I tried to circle the date on need to be so you have some idea when this happened and they don't kind of chronological order. So in 2015, there was a hack to Ashley Madison. So if we use those of you unfamiliar with Ashley Madison site, you could go on and sign out that you have an extramarital affair over the place to go cheat on your spouse.  And they were hacked and their personal information was released to everybody in the world. It was put online. You could go searchin. I'm sure you can still go search it and a number of high-profile individuals were found in there one day like most prominent reporter pain was one of the Duggar children from the I don't know. What's the show called that the one with a bunch of kids and a super conservative religious family and he was on there and evidently cheating on his wife. So that was highly reported. So all this information was put it on the internet. It was searchable and their number stories that came out of this not least of which is that there was somebody who committed suicide as a result of attack.  So somebody has life was so fat and packed it bite attack that they took their own life. And that is something that I'm sure nobody intended to happen, but was an unintended consequence of some of action side hacking into this day. Write. The second one was going back again to the app. I talked about last time the dating app OkCupid and this isn't 2016 that somebody went in and got all the data for OkCupid and put polish them online. So that others could work with him. Who was that other people could use this as a resource to understand these dating apps better, but just because the latest kind of public doesn't mean that you're allowed to collect it en masse about individuals who have not consented to have their day to put online.  I don't want this is the piece from wired 2 years ago and this talk about will discuss this in more detail later on in the course, but the fact of the matter is that courts are using metrics to determine how we should sentence criminals. And the idea is that this metric is supposed to measure How likely someone is to reoffend and if they're serious that they're likely to reoffend then we should not give them hell we should keep them in jail longer. We should try to rehabilitate is the idea but it was found that these data used to generate this were pretty biased so it use historical data and it really was not measuring whether or not they're likely to reoffend as much as the measuring where they grew up how much money they had and the color of the Skin So this piece does a nice job and I've included the Lincoln all these if you want to go read any more about them.  Another impactful hack was Equifax. So this was a software flaw and some open source software that they had not realized existed that allowed on their information be hacked and they had social security number stolen along with a lot of other information. This impacted tons of people. Lots of people froze their credit reports after this hack.  Another one that I thought was an interesting case was Strava is this app that allows you to track your work out? So whether you're running or biking and you can and I dated a shared online, at least it was at the time of this and what happened was they were texting patterns that were in places that you wouldn't expect and it ended up giving away location of secret US Army bases because these soldiers were putting shot on going out in the workout and we were not supposed to know about these bases and we did as a result of Strava data.  I don't work. So Google has this ethos of doing no harm.  And a lot of googlers and Outsiders argued that by helping the Pentagon use AI to identify drones with the idea was that from drone images that they they got you would be able to identify whether or not an object or human or object was and Google defended itself saying we're not using this for defense purposes. We are using this just identify images, but it's not a hard metal Leaf to see how this could be used in combat.  That piece is called on me then so they must look at me. Then this one I'm sure most of you are familiar with Cambridge. Analytica. Got data from an academic who got the data from Facebook and they use this to Target American voters using their own data. So this was a big piece in March of last year another one. This one's called recognition work the recognition decadence of the sea. So Amazon has generated at the ability to on video use facial recognition. And then they started seeking out Police Department's to use this and you could imagine that somebody in a crowd at a protest could be identified with this when they're not as how you doing anything wrong. And so there are limits to what this technology to be used for and people were concerned that they were working directly with police departments to get this up and running and seeking them out to do so.  Last one also from Amazon. This was just a few months ago Amazon wanted to become less biased and how they recruited individuals to work at Amazon and a generator. That's not all they decided they are so that when a new resume came in they would be able to determine an unbiased way whether or not they should bring a person in the interview and so they built this based on historical data that they already had that they use in recruiting for before and it didn't take them long to realize that there was a strong bias against women because they historically have not recruited women and hired women that moving forward when they built this model because the initial by date or biased their school with all Tobias, so they scrapped it once they realize that but if they had a good goal in mind, but what about it in a way that allow for their I'm tool to be biased  All right. So return back to this question, why are there questions being raised about the ethics of analytics? It's true. There's a lot of power that exists in analytic technology and data science projects, but they're also a lot of places where you need to be careful.  So the goal here is to start always thinking about what the ethical position is at the beginning of your projects around your project at the end of your project and you continue on without that you shouldn't do the project.  Good news is this is from Google's ngram viewer. So this is a chart showing the number of times at the shows up in the literature over time. So it goes back to the eighteen hundreds. You can see that there's a big increase recently in the discussion in the literature at least of Ethics. This is something people are discussing and thinking more and more. This is not exclusive to data science. This is just generally from Google  Okay, we're going to talk about a study that was done at Facebook and detail. We're going to walk through their questionnaire asking the result of the results of the experiment they did and then the ethics of it up to this point. Are there any questions?  So some background on before we talk about exactly what they did for anybody who doesn't use Facebook. There is a news feed information is displayed there that is somehow related to the people in your friends Network at the time of this study there 128 million users in the United States every day. That number has increased. This was the 6 in the paper is from 2014. But but I'd like to hear some 5:13 and this was talking about the news feed algorithm. So the average user has about fifteen hundred items eligible for their Newsfeed from all of the things that their fence post in our Network. Some people are way more some people have fewer any other than Celexa shows about three hundred items how it decided what show to you is proprietary. So Facebook knows about it, but we don't it is always existed from the first release of Facebook and initially had three metrics it now has more than a hundred thousand criteria that they use to figure out what to show you and it's constantly changing.  It almost certainly affects how you feel about what you're saying. And it's very likely I'm prioritises positive poster things are supposed to make you feel happy. The background. This is the paper it was published in pnas. So this is an academic Journal. This is a preeminent an academic Journal. That's one of the top journals and its host there in 2014 and it was published by and you can see the authors here at the first author Adam Kramer was from Facebook and the next to hear it says that there from Cornell the middle. There's actually from UCSF by the time it was published. So to academic institutions and then one private company.  So they set out to figure out whether or not the post you see on your news feed affect your emotional state and their three hypotheses that can happen there. I'm the first one is the social comparison hypothesis. This is that when you see lots of positive posts and all your friends being super successful and you are not having a great day or are feeling down about yourself at this might make you feel stressed or jealous or lonely or depressed as a result of comparing yourself to your social network. That's one hypothesis that the social comparison hypothesis. Hypothesis is the emotional contagion hypothesis. In this case. It's the idea that you will feel similar to the way the post you see on Facebook feel. So if you see a bunch of sad post it will make you feel more sad if you see a bunch of happy post it will make you feel more happy.  What their hypothesis is the null hypothesis? And this is just that it has no affect how you feel is not impacted by what you read on your Facebook news feed.  hypotheses  All right, so that's what they were testing in this experiment.  All right. So these are the data they went through and they ranked on many people's news feeds whether or not a post with positive negative or neutral positive had one positive or at least one positive word in it is said to be negative if it had at least one negative word and neutral if it had neither so it would like nice would be positive over like awful would be negative and they did this in an automated fashion. So it wasn't ready by the researchers. It was used and algorithm to specify how many positive negative neutral post there were.  Today's weather on how it broke down the post eligible for the study were almost half positive and then about a third neutral and then less than a quarter or negative. I think this is just interesting in and of itself. When you look at an entire, these are from hundreds of thousands of people on that almost got half our positive Post in general.  Okay. So this is government ran in 2012. It was a one-week study and subjects were eligible if they viewed Facebook in English and they randomly selected use my ID and I had almost 700,000 users in this experiment.  So this was how the study was designed so you had people looking at their newsfeed.  But they weren't just looking at their normal news feed Facebook was tweaking their Newsfeed a little bit and one arm of a storm and they were removing positive posts. They were decreasing the number of positive post by somewhere between 10 and 90% So they determine who's going to have 10% removed then they remove 20% 30% and they did that all the way up to 90% so that some people had just a little bit of the positivity religious and some had a lot of the positivity reduced.  They also did the alternative so people reviewing their Newsfeed and he's our separate people. They had the negativity reduced somewhere between 10 and 90%  is that they did over the course of a week, but in any experiment for to be any good, you need to have a control group to compare it to wrong button and they did that in each arm of the experiments. They had individuals in experiment one that had post randomly removed at between 10 and 90% but then it wasn't just being positive removed. It was at random and it did the same for 2.  The thing is I'm all post remain on your friends wall. So while you were in your newsfeed, they were all terrain that but you could go directly to somebody else's news feed and seed at sad post or that happy post has been removed. Perfectly controlled and post was not presented in if there was anyone doing it could appear later. So I didn't remove anything Facebook wasn't hiding anything from anybody profile, but they were from the news feed and had about a hundred and fifty five thousand people in each of these arms of the experiment.  This is a summary they were moving Post in the treatment arm and they were removing Post in the control arm. But the control arm was reduced fat removed at random. And then in the experiment one, there are moving other post an experiment to they were moving negative post this just to summarize everything I already said.  Okay, so this is what they were doing in the experiment, but then I had to have something that they were measuring to see if it was effective. So they were measuring two variables and they're doing is based on status updates that the individual they were studying posted later on.  Play measure the percentage of positive words that were in the status update the percentage of negative words that when it says update and the overall number of words that people produced.  So they do the post and then later on generator status update and Facebook with measuring how positive or negative at status update was.  Okay, so this will be a clever question. I'm going to give you guys a little bit of time to fill this out. The question will be on the next slide your job is to fill out this to buy to table. So this has to do with post. So if someone stole more positive post and then had sorry that should say status had more positive status fill in here whether or not you think that would be the social comparison hypothesis the emotional contagion hypothesis for the null hypothesis before social comparison. You see something positive makes you feel more negative emotional contagion is the opposite and then there would be no effect right to fill this out and then I'll open up the question in a minute on the next side.  When you're ready, the clear question is what you have in the upper right hand corner, so I'll bet table. Which do you have here?  how to close out in a few seconds  at 3 to 1  Okay, so most people said emotional contagion about 70% We doing this new people who are confused, which is totally fine. So we'll try to play that up. Now the idea here is that the emotional contagion hypothesis says that if you see a positive post you will also that's not the word.  Post a positive status so contagion would be down here as well.  And this would be comparison.  This is something you should always do when you are about to look a result you to think about if I see ex? What does that mean? If I see why what does that mean? So with that I'm going to 10% result and no with simply have been that there is no difference between what you see and what you post or what you see in the post and we posted your status.  Okay. So this is the main figure from their paper that I'm going to walk through. So these are the results from that first experiment where they had positive posts removed. So these are the statuses they posted and you can see that they control is in dark blue and the experimental is in light blue so that you can see when there was a reduced positivity and post there was a decrease in the number percentage of positive words in their status.  Weather when I point you guys to that you should look at any time you see a bar chart and we'll talk about this in detail later is whether or not it starts at 0. So this y-axis starts down here at 5, which makes the difference look bigger than it actually is so we're looking at a one percentage difference about 5.25 down to five point one five percent.  Any questions on that there?  On the flip side when positive post removed, they saw an increase in negativity in the status is again, this doesn't start at zero and this is a small difference between like 1.74 and 1.75 ish.  Other side of the arm, they saw that when negative post removed you saw an increase in the positivity and sizes and a decrease in the negativity and statuses. Okay. So what does this suggest we see that this is an agreement with the emotional contagion argument if anything but that the differences between the two are very small clear the statistic down here. They're not super important, but they just highlight that the students the differences between the two groups are very small, but they do exist.  OK Google facebook Cornell UCSF published a study in pnas and they're almost immediately objections from the community. So there was no IRB review and we'll talk about this in a little more detail later the IRB use your institutional review board every research University. Every publicly funded Research Institute has to have an IRB and this review board is where you submit your ideas about the experiments are going to do using human subjects and the IRB says you can do that or you cannot do that. In this case. There was no IRB review, but the researchers at Cornell did submit to the IRB the IRB just said that is outside of their purview cuz the data were collected at Facebook not at the University.  There's an informed consent will talk about what informed consent is accept accept the terms of service of Facebook. Sometimes a service of Facebook you may have in that thing that you don't read that you just click the box and say that you agree. You may have agreed to allow them to use your data for anything. They want in which case this will fall under that. There's also no to briefing after the experiment. These users were not informed that their data had been using this experiment that they had.  I had their Newsfeed intentionally altered based on the emotional content. So the guardian and slate both said that they had knowingly psychologically harmed users that their intent was to set out to back to the emotional state.  Those were a few of the moral and ethical objections. They're also number of methodological and interpretive objections. The first one I didn't talk about this but the way they raided the word does POD the post is positive or negative were using this instrument called the liwc 2007 and it was when published said it was not intended for lengthy text and we know that post can be lengthy on Facebook. So they may not have even used the right thing to analyze this they weren't using natural language processing to say how positive around negative. It was just like, oh there's a positive word that means positive or negative word which means that they're not able to differentiate between I'm not having a great day and a great so both of those would likely be positive post even though this is clearly not a positive post.  Doesn't fail to display the trend in the results. So if you remember I said that they remove post between 10 and 90% on people's news feeds. You wouldn't expect people would have 90% of the positivity removed from their Facebook feed to put this affect where real you were then see that their status has become much more negative than those that only had 10% removed and it didn't display this and the results and to me that suggests that they like we did that analysis but it probably didn't show anything so they didn't include in their paper, which is a question. We'll approach every clearing that if you have a lot of positivity removed from your Facebook news feed and we're arguing that this then leads to emotional contagion. You should then post statuses that are much more negative than those that only a 10% removed and they didn't they didn't share that in there now,  When did this before?  The other the other argument that was posted on the blog post and discuss why a lot of people so this is posted on a blog post called. I'm in defense of Facebook. This person was defending that this study was fine and one of their argument among others was that the effect was so small that doesn't really matter and there's two arguments here. So the fact was certainly small so I don't hear it are two definitions that overlap each other. So you're this dark one and this light one and can see that they're largely. Overlapping this here is a Cohen's which is what they use in the paper of .1 the larger this number the more different the distributions are and the largest bee in the paper was .02. So these would have been even more overlapping so the difference between though the control and experimental were super super small. The reason was statistically significant is cuz they had so many people so your statistical significance is affected by how many people are in the study.  Tell me the supercell difference.  And this person was arguing that that is a reason to defend Facebook cuz it didn't make that much of a difference. I would argue that it doesn't matter how big the difference is after all the studies either right or wrong at the beginning of the experiment is ethical not whether or not the sun is at the cold because of what you found there.  Okay, they argue that the  The differences were so small that it didn't really matter theoretically interesting but not very meaningful impact is so despite the fact that they will as a different it was tistical you different. It doesn't really make a difference in general.  So this point is the first time I'm asking this question. I want to get your feel for whether or not this study that I just told you all about was ethical and important.  how to close in a few seconds  at 3 to 1  Okay, so this point and this is what I want you guys to remember cuz at the end when we talked about the ethics in a little more detail, I'm going to try and have you guys convince your neighbor of your position. So we have a good pretty good spread here with most people saying it's somewhat or the bar just proportion saying that they somewhat disagree. I will return to this in a second.  Okay, any questions about the Facebook experiment the conclusions the limitations what concerns her?  Okay, this next part I admit it is a little dry, but it's something you guys should all be familiar with and first-year. What I'm showing is when pnas published this study they posted with this editorial note saying that they knew it was going to be controversial but they decided to publish it anyway, and their arguments are partially described here and what they say here is that for the protection of human research subjects does adhere to the common rule will talk about what that is in a second but that the private company Facebook does not have to follow that and so when it was published and collected the author for working at Facebook, so they weren't subject to the common rule. So therefore cannot decide to publish it despite the fact that other papers all have to follow the Conroe.  Okay. So what is the common role of the common rule was started it was published in the 80s 1981 and it is a requirement that research institutions have an IRB so I had that review board and that they always get informed consent from their research subjects.  So are these are required to track all the subjects to track with the studies are going on. And so that they keep a record of what researchers at their institutions are doing and it offers a number of additional protections for vulnerable populations. That is pregnant women fetuses prisoners in Children of the Corn Roll Call Commonwealth boat. Facebook wasn't required to do so is that individuals know and understand how their day will be used of any risks or benefits of an any possible consequences? So that box you check on Facebook despite giving your agreement to it is not informed consent cuz it cannot be reasonably assume that you read it and fully understood it. So a doctor in Bowling somebody in a study must sit down with patients and explain to them. What is going to be done in the study what the risks are what the limitations are any possible consequences and it can't be explained in  like legalese and jargon it has to explain in a way that is reasonably expected to be understood by the person they're talking to  nothing about informed consent is that it can be withdrawn at any time. So if you enroll in a research study, you are given consent and you give your informed consent you can a day a week a month a year from then remove it that you no longer want to be part of the study and then your data must be removed from that study.  So any research institution requires informed consent?  The other piece of important ethical rules is known as the Belmont report. So this is established in 1974. How many people by show of hands have heard of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment?  Okay, we have a few. Okay. So the Tuskegee syphilis study started in the 1930s and what it did was it enrolled 600 African American men into the study for 200 of them did not already had syphilis the researchers knew that syphilis put these individuals at a higher risk and it in medical danger relative to the people who do not acceptable if they were enrolled and told I was going to be a six-month study the study then went on for 40 years.  Additionally during this time men were given what they thought were special treatments, but we're really just procedures that the researchers wanted done such a spinal tap. The individuals were put at risk and their spinal fluid was removed from the body just to give the researchers more data and a no benefit to the men in the study. Okay. So that was all bad. What was worse is in the forties penicillin was discovered. It was known that penicillin would treat syphilis in these men the men were not told about penicillin or were they offered the treatment.  So this story broke in 1972, which is exactly when that study ended once news broke about this and as a response the Belmont Report was generated. So it is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines and it is supposed to be a tier 2 for all research with human subjects.  There are three main principles the first is beneficence. So this is the idea of Do no harm. That's what I will talk about the first two in detail, but just real briefly respect for persons has to do with all my money that the individual in your research study is in charge of what happens to them and you do not get to decide that for them. And the last one is a idea of justice. So who benefits from research and who should assume the risk of research is it the humans that are enrolled in the study or is it say researchers who need to take into account the fact that these are humans that they're working with.  Okay, so here we were talking about beneficence and there's this risk-benefit analysis. You can put people at some risk if the benefit is expected to be a lot. So you're supposed to minimize risk to the subject to the research, but there is some amount of risk that can be put on the place of the people in the study if the benefit is going to be great.  The respect for persons you are not allowed to withhold information necessary for individuals to make a considered judgment unless there's a compelling reason to do so, you can imagine that explaining in a lot of social sciences work explaining what you're going to do completely defeats the purpose of the research and tell them what you're trying to measure then you can't actually study the phenomenon you're trying to so there are places where you're allowed to withhold information that has to be cleared by the IRB before doing that research.  So in most cases, it demands that the subject enters voluntarily and knows what's going to happen, but there are times and I can do without.  So a special problem of content arises we're informing students of some person pertinent aspect of the research is likely to impair the validity of the research. So if you can't do the research in a valid Way by offering informed consent, there are times when you're allowed to not inform.  And not get involved with that. Alright, so here's one in all cases of research involving incomplete disclosure. Such creatures is only Justified if it is clear that include disclosure is truly necessary. There are no undisclosed risks to subjects. You can withhold information as long as it doesn't put them at risk of anything and Amazon or so, all three of these have to apply there's an adequate plan for the briefing subject. So you have to after the fact tell them what you did and why you did it. You can't cause risk you can't cause harm. I need to tell them after the fact why you did what you did?  Okay, so this is only included because he's the dad actual words of the Belmont report. Okay.  How should you out there in the world for seed?  Facebook case didn't get informed consent Cornell's IRB decided. They didn't need to follow this study because the date of our I collected at Facebook and they weren't actually human subjects research within the research Institution.  So because it's not just a time you care about it. If it were only a time you cared about that Facebook would have had to get informed consent because then individuals are always be in control of all of the information but we argue that there is that that this benefit to in beneficence and that there's just so that there's research that's worthy to be done that can only be done. If you don't tell people you're doing so because of his mouth and can you do get exceptions to informed consent? Okay. So I said to avoid information about whether to participate in the experiment the alternative was not producing and has withholding data about Facebook's everyday risks.  So we're going to hear is at the benefits. We would gain from knowing how Facebook feeds affect our emotional state outweigh the need to give all of the information up front.  There's an argument to be made here. However, that Facebook could have asked people to enroll in a study and then done the experiment and then I guess they still would have had to give him all the details but would have been people who decided to take part in this rather than deciding for them.  Okay, so open it up again. This is the same question. You guys lasted Facebook Cornell and you see a study on Facebook users with ethical and important.  At this point feel free to try and convince your neighbor to sway and you on their most of those who haven't used it. If you change your answer it will simply change it you won't get more than one boat.  How do I get another 10 seconds?  3 2 1  Okay, so we did a shift a slight increase in people who said they somewhat disagree I would say personally because I'm going to ask people to try and defend their position that I am closer to the de side. So I don't think those people are wrong and I totally empathize with the people in the eh bee. I also know that I wrote this question where you were to decide that it was at the kalenda important and you could argue that you are it is one but not the other so I would are there any of volunteers who want to defend the strongly disagree position so that a physician  if they can get away with  I think that's great response to the argument here friend who couldn't hear it is that it sets a bad precedent while this may have been in the grand scheme of things something small that they did. It sets a precedent allowing them to do larger things going forward in the future. So if we agree that this is okay. What's to stop them from taking this one step further and us always having to say that that's okay or anybody from the beat Edition when I argue their position,  Where are you calling? Somebody has to be able to defend it.  and so just a little  better than you  Okay. Okay, so it doesn't really matter how small the effect was. It's that we didn't ask people ahead of time. So we like that the studies being done but it should have been done in a better way with and it was suggested that there was a check checkbox allowing people to consent and give their approval that this be done to their data and their newsfeed.  Anybody from the neutral and explain what they were why they're conflicted or where they're in the middle.  I don't know 4:30 there. I am curious.  I think it's definitely unethical because not like that but I think the research was important in determining how Facebook post are effects of giving mine because you could have it.  I think it's the result would show that was not important because of how badly was done because post are not necessarily correlate to how your mind actually feels. Okay. So unethical generally about how they approached it and but we do need to study of the argument that this is something we should study me when I understand we should do it an ethical Manner and the other aspects of the argument and correct me if I'm wrong here is that it was the results were unimportant because it was not done properly. We don't really now understand any better how a post makes us feel emotionally given experimental design. I think I could agree with all that I would about be somewhat agree in the strongly agree.  Yeah, I think I said I'd State based on important because Facebook is probably one of the few sources actually had the ability to study something like that and although I think I'd say that Facebook is within their ice cream. So they are servants that pretty much like their entire business users and I might be unethical but if they're monetization at its within their rights to do so, so that's why I think I hear is that while there are concerns about the ethics Facebook is within their rights to do so, they are accompanied their data is their business model and they have the right to do with their data as they please.  Maybe I can argue from the de perspective.  Okay with that thinks there's not always an answer but there is important considerations and I think we're all at a similar place somewhere on the spectrum that we need to consider the ethics, but that we don't always agree exactly where that line is.  Okay.  So are we in this room as going forward as data scientist? I think we can agree that one subject for a little or no incremental risk, and they stand to benefit from its results. We should always think of the mindset of this common rule where we need to get informed consent and take a cue from the Belmont report to make sure that we're not harming people when we shouldn't be harming them.  And that we're all in this together right now. The onus as data scientist is really on us as an individual to do the right thing. So I went back and forth about whether or not to cover gdpr in this lesson. So that's the general data protection regulation and that is applicable in the EU and we in a states do not have Federal Regulations controlling data or privacy. I anticipate that changing and could totally be wrong in future years, but I figured cuz right now those don't apply to us that I was going to discuss it but it isn't important discussion to have as to what those regulations should be and I was feeling that he's going to start with those should be going forward for others.  So if the onus is on us, what can we do? How do we make sure that we're not proceeding in an unethical way and I really like this idea. So this was a tweet from somebody who said that he created functions that when he is analyzing individual data. He puts this little message to himself to remind himself. These are real people you dummy they aren't just a two points changes in their house have actual impact on their lives and their lives around it is really easy when you're in the weeds generating plots and doing analyses to lose track of the fact that just bees represent individuals. Each of these is a human what you do to them affect their lives affects the lives of those who know them. I'm so it's really important to remember that data points are people  Everything is you know, before you share the results of the project before you do the project before you decide to do the project make sure that you consider by us and we'll talk about this throughout the course and that your conclusions are fair for this course any course, you want to make sure you had a paper that don't ever say that you want to hand in project that don't have mistakes in them to work and not be used to harass people especially minorities in anyway, and that is something to think about when you see the results as to whether or not this could be a impact even if it's not your intended impact analysis should be independent of your opinion about the specific problem. You're trying to solve using data and it is difficult because we want to answer questions we care about you should answer questions you care about should not care about them so much that you only accept what you want to see by the best question to those were you really don't care about the answer you're just interested in the question whether or not it comes out at the end to be option A or option b is equally valid  You're fine with whatever happens and you're just interested in knowing the answer and that's when you can get the least biased results.  Building if you'll be waiting a bit about this for your first assignment ethics checklist are things being discussed right now and they're not all that often use and implemented but they raised questions for you to see where your bias exists. So the first thing like is your team bias is it only does your team only include people with a very similar background and point of view or similar age or similar necessity or gender. They do you want to consider all of those ways in which your team is bias to see where you might be missing. There's an example from Cheryl Sanders Lane in where she said that there was no parking when she got the Facebook for pregnant women and that's just because there had been no pregnant women. What do you think about who is missing from your team because there to think about what considerations you would have to make for them?  Bars in collection or the date of themselves as something you should always look are you trying to measure something about all the people under 18 in the United States? And you managed to only collect data on 16 year olds, that would be a problem. Do you have informed consent? When you should do you have a mechanism for removing somebody's date if they decide they want to be in there and then later decide they don't you should have a way to remove that person say to going forward and that's not always a simple task is your knowledge of transparent. Could you explain to your mom to somebody in elevator to your boss to your colleagues what you did and you should be able to do that to all of those people and then you should always be thinking about negative or unintended consequences of your findings. The one story. I was listening. Also. I have a podcast problem. So I love podcast. So I'll use example of short from them more than this but I was going to podcast about somebody talkin and they were computer scientist talking about they're awesome technology that allowed them to alter video in a realistic way so that the video could be changed after sex. It was for video editing.  If I were giving his podcast and I stumbled a few times we could or I want to completely change what I said, we would be able to do that with the technology is how this person was selling it the interview then asked what what about all the other ways. This could be used like in local campaigns to make something look like they said something they didn't actually say and do it in a realistic way and she as a computer scientist argued like what I just make the things that's not my job and I want every in this room to realize that it is your job. And you are you have to think about the negative an unintended consequences of your findings. That is something it seemed an interview and I don't know what she was thinking it seemed like she had never thought about that before and after problem.  The last time I mention is this do a plan for checking your biases going forward into the world. We later discovered by a seas and very infrequently do we actually go back and fix them? So you need to find a regular check-up generated and then a process for going back and fixing them. Should they be found?  Okay, Beyond is what you will be reading about in your for your assignment. You have to consider how your questions are going to be asking for your final project for your assignments where the ethical considerations for each of these have to come from.  So very briefly. I want to talk to spacek's about data handling and how when you have data what you need to do with them before I do questions with anybody.  It's very briefly. I just wanted you guys to be familiar. You don't need to know details about these two different ways to die 2. And if I data do you collect all this awesome day that you use it for your research you want to put it out into the world before you do that you need to remove any but not as PIR personally identifiable information there two ways to do that the first when I can spend a lot of time on his called expert determination that is some expert decide that you have adequately removed personally identifiable information. I think we can all agree that's not necessarily the most tractable that people can make mistakes. So Safe Harbor is the other one where it specifically identifies how which information should be removed. We're going to briefly go through them. You obviously need to remove names cuz those are identifiable if you tell me your name, he might not be the only person with that name, but it really homes in on the possible individual me to get rid of geographic subdivision smaller than a state. Although there are exceptions for zip codes and they have very specific and you can read them. If you feel like it on what ZIP code can be included and what  2 Chainz about them to use them before you release them and it makes sense because if you have a zip code that only has a hundred thousand people living in it that really starts the zoo in on who they data belong to.  You also course have to get rid of things like phone numbers and email addresses. And of course Social Security numbers, cuz those are individual level data and there are 19 of these that you have to remove before you release any data.  In addition to that. This is the world's simplest slide on encryption. I just want you all to know what the word means if you don't already and this means that it on your computer screen, you are reading the date of the age of a dial white cat jumps over the sleeping dog. If you were then send those data I'm using encryption to somebody else you would only be able to read those data if they also had the secret key shared. So anybody in the interim would get this nonsense that doesn't make any sense to them. This is the most basic explanation of encryption. It's a data when shared that have any private information in them should always be encrypted.  The password you have on all of your apps are also encrypted. They store them in that manner unless they're doing something horribly horribly wrong. Okay. So in the last few minutes, I want you to try to convince me. Just get this first one just so that we go to this one. I want you all to  Not to open that determine and discuss with each other to try to come to some consensus with you and your neighbors. You don't have to you can still disagree and answer whether or not sleeping body should have access to genetic databases.  Create a few seconds.  3 2 1  I just a little more even I think in the beginning we had a lot more people saying they somewhat agree. So we've had people shift towards the disagree side anybody on the disagree side when I explain their position here.  So you are strongly disagree or somewhat disagree.  I know it's important as we can stay for the criminal tissues and I think we don't know right so the police could do something in a less than transparent way and there are cases of how this would happen so they can take this information from criminals, but we don't always understand or no or they don't share with us how they're using this information which is why you could disagree with using these genetic information and getting it  Maybe I'll swing argue or disagree position.  anything  so I'll miss being used.  Okay, sweetheart doing here is that it should only be used in specific cases that we've lined out ahead of time. So when there is imminent risk to the public, this is a case where it should be used. But where you want to find somebody who hasn't liked pay the parking tickets. I'm putting those words in your at that wasn't part of the example that maybe we should have had that be on the notice. We were only uses in cases that have been laid out before hand and reserve it for those very special cases.  Great to the fact here is your not signing off when you sign up for 23 and me to incriminate your family members or those close to you. So it's unethical to use this and I think that is a great argument. I do you want to stop by here because I didn't already is at 23andMe currently does not share their data with the police and argued that they're not going to however, you can get all of your raw data and there is a website where people are putting all of their data up too often. It's for finding adoption cases, but the police are using that could be 23andMe data that were not given from 23andMe and yeah.  so personally, I feel like even things like fingerprints being taken by the police can be an invasion of privacy of an individual and if you give them another thing to identify a person  you are always going to be able to consent to them taking it but the idea cuz that might be the match that they said let me take some for spit so I can genetically identify you instead and that's a lot more scary to me personally because I don't want to be tracked by the police right services.  Data or information that they collect from you before you've been charged or been found guilty of anything. Is it invasion of privacy? And we all have a right to that privacy. I don't even want to argue from the other side.  And those are those are compelling argument. I think there are a lot of arguments on the other side too. So for those of you who said they somewhat agree or strongly agree.  the Kathy Wright  almost  I know it's getting everything hungry. We're getting for the end of the year is this has been used in cases like the Golden State killer we're cold cases have gone on for decades and families have done no peace that people are still out in the population and they are dangerous. So this would be an argument for when we should use it.  Any other arguments I want to put a new device without their okay.  All right, the last one this pertains to what you all will be doing and I think again there I wouldn't put it up there if there were arguments all around but the question is if the data has been freely shared on the Internet. It's okay to use them for my data science a research project.  Maple Leaf  m321  Okay this to me looks similar to what we had in the beginning. I'll let anybody argue what their position is. Just tell her to whether you agree or disagree. Let me know what you were thinking in your thoughts when you made that boat.  I feel that we talk every itching to get out of here. I can't think.  And I feel like like date on internet.  Greater just headed out there. We should have left early use it. We need to think about the ethical implications and these date on the internet could be used for harassment and it's something we need to think about whether or not the data we use and the analysis we do can be used to harm or harass in any way other individuals.  Anybody else want to argue their position?  Can verify the validity of today?  Prepare to cancel the arguments there where you don't know the validity of the data. So you always should consider the source of your day that somebody could have generated a random data set that you're Now using I'm thinking it's a true date. Is that or somebody could have put it up as a joke and it contained completely false data and the first argument was that informed consent. You can't really get from the internet. I'm going to add on to that one. There's a Technique we talkin about called Web scraping and there it's where you just take information from a web page and you can generate your own dataset from that and there are certain places that allow it some places that don't so if you're ever doing was grieving you should make sure you're allowed to do it beforehand. I'll talk about that on the web scraping lecture. I just want to mention that now anybody else wanna argue.  Okay lyrics briefly if the data are out there as big as that they're allowed you to use that have been shared that are sourced from a reliable place. You can use them there are lots of them and with that I'll see you on Tuesday such-and-such Monday.  San Diego forecast "
