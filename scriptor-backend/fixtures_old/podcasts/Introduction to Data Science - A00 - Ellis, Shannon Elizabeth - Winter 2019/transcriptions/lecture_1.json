    "File Name": "Introduction to Data Science - A00 - Ellis, Shannon Elizabeth - Winter 2019-lecture_1.flac",
    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast. All right. Can you guys hear me?  There are some seeds appear for you. If you over there a few over here the backs pretty full one or two.  In about can you guys hear me got the nuts? Okay.  All right, welcome to cause nine as ever to get seated. This is Introduction to data science. I'm dr. Shannon Ellis. I'll be your instructor for this course and my plan today was to run through what a typical lecture would kind of be like all though arguably today. This will be like the most high talk in a line throughout the course the brakes and all the other lecturers these slides and all slides for the course will be available on Triton Ed if you didn't have them today and only today I glued it a bit ly link there in case for some reason you don't have access to train dead yet.  All right. So each lecture will start just by discussing what the goal of that day will be and today it's pretty simple today. We're going to trying to find data science talk about a few examples to get her be thinking about what it is. And then we're to talk about the course Logistics questions are always more than welcome. There's a lot of you and I would much rather if something I say is confusing the address right away rather than hundreds of you being confused as you leave the room, you need a clarification. If you need me to repeat something I'm always welcome to do. So, if you ask a question that is like outside of the scope of what we're going to discuss we can talk about it offline we can email about it, but you're free to ask any questions throughout the course.  Okay, so often when we talk about data science, the first thing we talked about is what data science isn't when we're trying to find it and this comes from kind of the fact that they planted a new discipline is exciting. It's moving its still changing we had in like nail down a perfect definition yet.  And I like to compare this to When I Was An undergraduate I studied biology and when I took my first biology course, I walked in and biology. It's in the name. It's the study of life. It's very clear that the definition you probably use the same everywhere and the syllabus is kind of the same no matter where you take intro bio and that's just in plead not the case for data science yet. And I think that's what makes it exciting. So I would much rather be in a place where things are interesting super cool all the time and moving and changing better than having a perfect definition that said this is from nyu's website is no longer up. This is an old snapshot a screenshot of their website. If you click on what is data science, this is what it says. There's much debate among Scholars and practitioners about what data science is and what it isn't does a deal only with big data what constitutes big data is data size really that new how is it different from statistics and Analytics?  I think every in this room could probably agree that that's not an answer to the question. What is a of Science? In fact it leaves you with way more questions than you started with and I think that really is emblematic of the fact that data science is changing that we don't have a perfect definition. Another answer to what data is not is it is not machine learning machine learning is a great tool. It is something that they did scientists use. It is something we will discuss in this course, but it is a field into splint on Intuit oven to itself. So they are not cinnamon synonyms machine learning is part of data science, but it is not all of it. Okay having discussed with data science isn't here to display a Venn diagram that quickly went viral in the data Science World a few years ago. And it's from Drew Conway's blog and he showed this Venn diagram saying that do scientists are combinations of people who programmed attacking skills who have teeth math and statistics knowledge and then have some substantive expertise so they know something about some  Subject and they put data scientist right in the middle.  Then this became kind of a meme and people made their own the other Venn diagrams and here you see the same three larger circles, but in the middle, it says that there's unicorns or something that doesn't exist. So this argument was happening. It was saying that there aren't that many people who have CF expertise to really understand deeply math and statistics and know something deeply about some subject matter whether that is biology or that's about something an industry or some company. So they're saying that these people don't really exist very often and I think that is a really good explanation as to why undergraduates are Now setting data science and why there are undergraduate majors and graduate courses in data science. So as a response UCSD many other places have majors and minors in data science address this so that they have those programming skills. So they understand the math and statistics necessary to analyze data.  Here is a joint effort between computer science math and cognitive science and I sit in the cognitive science department. And this is really responds to Industry and research demand for the Day's Night. Is there lots of jobs out there people enjoy these jobs and we should be treating people well for these jobs, okay. Definition in your own time. These are all definitions that have been proposed by people in the field summer shorter summer longer most of them agree that there's some role of statistics and data analysis and programming some people say the discipline or an umbrella term or a study on the definition. I'm going to go with here and that I like is the scientific process of extracting value from data. The reason I like this is cuz datasat the Corvette but the thing is data are everywhere. Every time you guys send a text or post something on social media their data being generated the companies are holding onto but by themselves are really not worth a ton. It's when you are able to extract value and meaning from those data and  Interesting questions that you're doing data science work, but I also think it's important to mention if there is a scientific process in here as a scientist, you're asking interesting questions, you're generating hypotheses what you think you're going to find and then you're carrying out analysis to answer that question. So that's the definition. I like and I could change that next year about what I like better from then cuz I guess that is evolving and changing bathroom going with for now.  I said this is from a piece by DJ Patel and Thomas Davenport to Jay Patel was the chief data scientist and wrote. This piece of data science is the sexiest job of the 21st century. And the reason it is is because data scientists. Enjoy their jobs are getting paid. Well, they like what they do they get to do interesting things. So we're here to train people to get to do those really cool things.  All right.  What winter about what day does science is and is not definition any questions so far?  Okay, imaginist data scientist get to ask interesting questions and then use data to answer them. So I'm going to work through a few examples to give you an idea of what day does scientists do so the first one if you were interested in answering what questions you should ask on a first date you could take online dating app data and answer this question. So OkCupid this this isn't old example. I realize this is probably not the app that people are using for online dating anymore. But I think of an example still holds true.  So OkCupid the way it worked is or works. I don't know it's still probably exist. So there are questions and their database that people answered when they signed up for their at they got to answer as many or as soon as they wanted. They do was a more of these that you answer you could be better matched with somebody else will answer the questions similarly.  So they had hundreds of millions of answers in there. And this is their plan all the questions in their database. That's at First Column and on the y-axis you have the number of questions on the x-axis, you have their process the first they had almost 300,000 questions. They first got rid of the ones that were duplicates. They've been eliminated those that were too personal because these are the questions you wouldn't ask on a first date you then I got rid of the two obvious questions that were that were too obvious and would not be used for figuring out whether I or compatible. So obvious question would be like, are you a murderer right leg up obvious every Tuesday to not a murderer who should be in the same pool on so they got rid of those types of questions, which it exists in OkCupid database. So then they had some 50,000 viable first date questions. So this was their starting dataset to answer their question. They went from hundreds of thousands down to 50 thousand questions.  And they argue that if you want to know whether or not you and your date have long-term potential you should on your first date asked if they like horror movies if they've ever traveled around another country alone and ask. When did he find to Chuck it all and go live on a sailboat. Let me show the results from their analysis. Imma give you guys a second or minute to look it over. I don't think this is the best way to display these data, but it's how they chose to do it. So we have to interpret and this is going to be part of this force is looking at figures and figuring out what they mean. So I'm going to give you a few minutes. Feel free to talk to your neighbor and I would love for somebody to explain to me what they think's going on. Are you free to chat. I know you reduce yourself to your neighbor 2  All right.  Why we're fighting down there are two seats up here of anybody from that wants to sit down feel free to come up there. So I think maybe one over there in the corner to Okay, who wants to take a debit what's going on here?  I know answer the first question scary on the y-axis up here the numbers.  awesome  Okay, so the percent of people who agree on the questions at the exactly, right? All right, and then what's this first one where they say is that important in your life is sex the most important part of really shift is smoking discussed you what are those three questions?  I think it's at the top or want ya.  Okay, so that's great. Use the keys are the top 3 user rated match questions, which is also right have a sense of what that might be what that means. Yes.  The most popular that's a great guess. It's not quite right and it says because I left a piece of information out from OkCupid. Yeah.  Puppy questions that got people match we're getting there.  Okay, so what three questions people think are the best ass so these are the ones that were rated by people as being important to them in a partner. So not only did you give when you were answering questions on OkCupid what your response was but you told them how important it was to you that your partner also have been. So amongst those that were by users what they thought was most important. These are result in that first, What can we draw from the conclusions from these first two bars the dark dark blue and the light blue?  What's up with the light blue? What's the light blue?  Okay expected from Pure chance. So if there were no effect, you would expect to see somewhere just under 5% matching on all three by chance alone. So anything above that would suggest that there is a some sort of effect and we'll use that way throughout the course. There's some sort of signal something saying that it's different than chance alone. So we're saying by those three questions that were raided by people as being important to themselves about 12% of them were in long-term relationships and agreed on those. Okay. That's at what can we conclude about these questions off to the right?  So they have right hand side is almost four times as likely if you agree on those three, so if you both answer those questions the same that you would more likely be in a long-term relationship with that person. Okay. I know though is taking apart a figure we'll do that throughout the course, but this is again not how I would have display these data. It wasn't that into it, right? It kind of took us some time to figure out exactly what you depart was. This is an example of not the perfect grass, but an interesting question that was answered.  Okay, the second example that I'm going to talk about a data science project is also a little little older and data that you would probably not get so easily today. So somebody decided they wanted to study coordinated migration. So if a population from City a flows to a population in City be so a bunch of people from City a to City B, and it's a coordinated migration is the cities from where Hometown day is on city has the largest population of those individuals to do this project were ever get anonymized data from all users on Facebook who lost their home town and their current city on their Facebook profile example of a way to get a ton of data and a ton of worldwide data using in a creative way to answer this question. Otherwise answering who has migrated from one city to another on a worldwide scale would be really difficult.  This is the worldwide map of coordinated migration. The lines connect cities that have high levels of coordinated migration and there are few things that you could conclusions. You can draw from these the first one if we focus in on rapidly urbanizing countries were focusing here in Africa, you can see that major destinations of coordinated migration to make sure I turned that on I did that's why you cannot hear me are happening in rapidly urbanizing countries not wholly surprising but we can really see the patterns of this at a Citywide level.  The second one is that there are different types of international coordinated migrations that have United States as a destination to highest volume cities were coming from Cuba and Mexico because they are the destinations where these two countries are migraines United States are are different. So Cubans 10 To My Grave most heavily to Miami and Mexicans was heavily to Chicago and this is a pattern that maybe wouldn't have been intruded by lots of people before you looked at the data that you were one. You probably would have the next time you may not up.  Okay, we did OkCupid example. We talked about coordinated migration any questions on those two examples.  Okay, the last one will be an example about how do you improve ride sharing these data come from on Broadway Tech and he used to work at Uber is now Professor here and he presents and then I'm presenting here to you are some data from Uber from years ago and what you see on the y-axis are relative events and on the x-axis or ETA in minutes, and these are separated out by whether or not the ride was completed or cancelled and you can see the proportion of events that we either completed or canceled. I'm going to give everybody a minute to figure out what this is displaying. What can we conclude from this graph?  different chat with each other again  All right.  As a calm down who maybe for the back of the room has a thought on this.  What can we conclude from these to curse?  All right, anybody from not the back of the room include?  Cancel the Ride app. Okay, so it's time goes on more and more people will cancel the ride. So if we focus here at eight minutes, we can see that more people that fewer people. Sorry that the rate of people not believing their events that kids learn the rest of Highway explained that you did a much better job at sunrise in that. So we're measuring rides and the time that they were estimated for their arrival more people. Cancel that time goes on.  And we're not measuring patient at all here, but we're getting an understanding of how impatient affects whether not somebody cancels their ride. And this is something that data scientist do often is that your measuring one thing and then you're using it to understand something else. So we're measuring rise whether or not the right hand happened and what the estimated time of arrival was and then we're getting some understanding of Ryder patients. This is completely cancel with in San Francisco. This is an example of what happened as you launch Uber in subsequent City. So it start in San Francisco and then launched in other cities, so that's what the long the x axis so San Francisco to be over here and then each city as it rolled out and this is showing that overtime people get less and less patient there less willing to wait for a ride based on that estimated time of arrival.  Set Savannah city and we can also see you within the city from one year to the next that people are getting increasingly less patient. They expect the rides in a faster and faster Manner and this could be because people are getting them at a faster rate. So there is based on your weight 7 minutes, but then now used to getting them in 5 minutes or it could just be the fact that they expect more more out of a company over time, even though they're right experience isn't changing.  Any questions about that example?  Okay, so I gave you three examples. There are lots of types of questions that a scientist work on they could be political. They can be an industry at a company trying to increase Revenue. They can be improving efficiency at a company the all of this is that you're asking questions and you're using data to answer them.  Okay, the next part we're going to walk through a few places where data scientist work the first you will likely be obvious to see the last few maybe less. So Amazon and Google hire tons and tons of data scientist. This is a screenshot from Amazon back in the day. I'm sure you're familiar with the fact that Amazon started by becoming the world's largest seller of books, but that was never their sole intention. They wanted to become from the beginning the seller of everything and have largely done that so in addition to selling all the things they've also branched out into computer with Amazon web services into Hardware many of you likely have a Kindle you probably don't have a fire phone as that kind of was not one of the most successful projects many people of Echoes. They've gone into the industry entertainment industry with and they've been working hard to work into the grocery industry acquire Whole Foods and then trying to be able to sell things like eggs without them breaking in a in a QuickTime.  Sattazahn Google dessert places that employ lots of data scientist to do lots of things. I know that is very vague. But that is they do they come up with your recommendation system to figure out what you're likely to buy. They figure out how to once they figure out what you should buy how to best Market it to you.  What are lots of other companies the gig economy is full of data scientist? So Airbnb employees lots of data scientist and they have teens will talk at a later lecture about how they use image recognition. So you decide you want for your place on Airbnb and you want to rent it out on Airbnb and you said that you were a 3-bedroom house. How does Airbnb know to believe that the pictures you put on actually of a 3-bedroom house and not just 3 pictures of the same bedroom. So they're going to use image processing to say to can't sit and look through all the pictures for all the places submitted to figure out whether or not you're telling the truth, but they're also going to use a b testing to figure out how to best Market their product to you and a b testing is I show half of the classic version a and the other class at random person be  Find out to get that Airbnb more at a higher rate as like the simplest version of 80 testing. What's the way to figure out what we should do before? It's an experiment to pay you. Should we do a or should we do big natural language processing to figure out how happy people are with different are babies that ran out predictive modeling to see which markets they should move into what's going to become the next big place that people are vacationing as well as regression analysis in collaborative filtering if these words don't mean anything to you now, that's okay. This is what we're going to discuss throughout the course we talked about the fact that arrival times are estimated using data science at Uber and Lyft, but they also need to be able to forecast demand and figure out pricing and set it accordingly so that you're not short driver somewhere as though you're not overcharging customers were right. They won't pay measure of safety and fraud detection are in a rural and ever increasing in importance at Uber and Lyft and also efficient navigation to the drivers are happy with  Their experience driving in that you're happy with how quickly you get to where you're going.  Stitch fix is a company that employs data scientists throughout the entire process. If you're unfamiliar with the company, they set out to disrupt the industry of clothing purchase. And so you get sent a box to the parallel and if you like everything you keep everything. If not, you said if that's what it's supposed to be tailored to your interest and your body type. We'll talk about the algorithms used here later in this course as well.  Now for a few that might be less obvious. There are lots of companies in plenty of time to say you wouldn't sink and copies have been around for a really long time. There was one example, I'm at Shell they had this they realize they had a problem that they had three thousand different oil drilling machine parts and that they were expensive and hard to move and they had no idea when they were going to need them where they didn't know what was going to fail when they have no idea what to keep in stock or where to put it once they bought it or when they were going to need it. So the hours to 45 minutes and they save millions of dollars off of transporting things to where they didn't need to be based on their peer guessing. That was incorrect.  Black example on Mansion is a slightly simpler one, but this was employed by Dr. Pepper and Snapple the sales people in the company used to show up to sell their product and it's like big binder and they would then try to sell things out of stud finder. So I was like, hey, you should probably just like use iPads was the proposal for the president wasn't on board. They sent the president with the iPads and they studied what happened and they saw that buying increased 50% over the previous sales. So then the present was on board and this was just a simple example of how they identified a problem using the data tested it and then move forward with the updated process.  Okay, all that, that's great. We talked about the definition of data science. What is what it isn't we talked about a few examples of projects and where data scientists work now will talk about the details of what we're to do in this poor boy move on anything on clear up to this point.  So first and foremost you all are here. We have left her here Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 a.m. My office hours will be right after class on Thursday and I'm Parkside building 243. If you can't make it at time you are free to email me to set up a time outside of those hours and I'll do my best to facilitate that with that. I wanted to introduce you to the rest of the instructional team who can make it today so that when you show up to section or when you show up to office hours, you know who you're looking for and who they are and what they're doing. So we'll just go in order and I'm just going to invite them up here to tell you who they are or what they study whatever they want to share with you about their role here at UC San Diego Torres on 1st.  Section and hours are Tuesdays one 2 p.m. So you see you soon. Hopefully next.  Yeah.  Hi everyone, I'm Rob boutilier. I'm also tasty student and see if I can find apartment. I'm actually finishing my dissertation and I'm about to graduate it's on isolation how this works Commission on a used multimodal neuroimaging to do that. My advisor is Brad voice acting classes couple times before and also she's statistics. So I'm very comfortable with this subject like martial arts and dance.  Hey guys, my name is Jaden. Number for Taylor math and computer science major at UCSD this my first time being I in any class, so I look forward to teaching everyone and he had part of the Squadron. Just let me know if you need anything in section or not precise. I'm just something about me. I just really love Sakura and I'm a big man united phone. So if you want to discuss that'll come like talk to anything.  Suzanne wasn't able to make it today. He had a conflict but he has office hours on Thursdays and you will meet him and he'll be able to help you out.  Hi everyone. My name is Waylon. Y'all I'm a second-year talks on major. This is my first time being I so I'm kind of excited about it. So I have to have a section yet. But feel free to come to my office hour is Wednesday 1 to 2 p.m. At the csb building Fallout 4 play by myself and the boxing. So if you can talk with me.  All right, and they will be a great help to both me and you throughout the quarter. The last part is a note down here. This is a student who is not an official t a r i a butt if throughout the course you are struggling with programming at all. She has offered to do office hours to meet with anybody and so she will be a great resource to she's an undergraduate student. So feel free to email her.  Okay. Any questions about that has this is in the syllabus. This will be on the slide.  Okay. So this in general is a survey course, which means that we have a lot to cover a lot of topics to cover and protect like to say that this is a course where each lecture could be a course in into itself and is in many places. So we're really just covering the concepts of that you're familiar with them. So you start thinking like a data scientist, but we won't be going into depth in any single one of them. So we teaching from Concepts and examples and stories will be a focus on communication and understanding how to communicate as a data scientist, which is very important in section will also be a focus on ethics which is really important as you guys all start as data scientist to understand how to think ethically and perform at the Glee as a data scientist and we will do some programming in this course. I'm you will not come out an expert if you are not already but you will start to get more comfortable with how data scientist approach programming. So basically details of everything are not covered to tell them programming we will not be talking about in debt statistics will really just skim the surface of Statistics we won't be  Passing any Theory and you won't leave with the technical skills to be a data scientist after this course.  Are the course objectives are in the syllabus and our peer generally, I want you to be able to at the end of his course come up with data science questions and figure out what how you should approach them analytically in middle of that data are messy. So I want you to be able to Wrangle the data. So you need to have the programming skills to read a dataset into Python and we decided on this course and you need to be able to clean it will talk about what that means and I want you to be able to generate some basic visualization and appropriate visualization so that if the type of day do you have matches the type of visual aid is a shame you're generating.  We'll talk about and all of these are listed on the calendar at the end of your syllabus and will prevent them. But generally will focus on data science and ethics in the beginning and Version Control will that move into understanding data and the programming needed to Wrangle data, you'll do basic data visualization. And the last third of the course will talk about data analysis.  Okay, these are course links first WPS a show of hands who has used fiance before. Okay, most everybody great. This will be your point of contact for everything in the course so you can contact me there and it stays in the eyes and you can ask each other questions with a great resource for you all and it's very resourceful as to not have the same question over and over again in our emails much rather you all see it's a Bissell be your point of contact for everything if you ever down and you need to submit something and if you can email me and my email is on the syllabus. This course will be podcast. There is a link for an honesty back. I'll talk about that in a second and then all the course materials to readings and the reading quizzes Which will talk about and the grades. Will it be on TriNet? Okay the feedback for real quick. This is my intention is to never use an example to offend anybody ever say anything is offencive. If I do I want there to be a place where you can submit that.  You can also submit feedback if there's something you wish I'd been covered or something that you really liked. This is the place for that. It's only deals by me. Not that she has her eyes, but a word of caution. This can be taken down at any point in time and I will let you know if it happens if I'm getting things are unhelpful soon example of something that would be unhelpful or if I'm getting like 50 to a hundred people telling me that they don't like my voice. That's something I can't change. So that shouldn't be submitted their this is my voice. That's what it is alternatively if I get fifty to a hundred of you telling me I speak way to quickly in lecture, which is totally Valley cuz I speak very quickly. That is something you could say on the Steve at 4, because that is something I can work through dress clear.  All right be back on that form is anonymous and it will help me adjust the force if there's something you liked or disliked.  So generally attendance is not required. There are lots of you here today. I imagine there will not be this many of you every Tuesday and Thursday. I would love to see all of you but you all are all busy and learn in different ways. So the only time attendance will be required are for guest lectures. There are two of them. The first is February 21st. The second is March 12th. I have here that it's subject to change. I don't anticipate it changing that is also the day of your second exam. So you will likely show up for that day.  The extra Credit Opportunity is there if you answer more than half of the clicker questions and more than three-quarters of the lectures, which starting Thursday you will get 2% out of your final grade. So briefly we will be using clickers in this course, and I wanted to explain why I like to use Clickers.  First of all Lebron there a whole lot of you when I am teaching a smaller horse in there 30 people. I can look at the first three rows and Te'o everybody is confused. Nobody has any idea what I'm talking about and then I can slow down back up. We explain that is less easy. It is harder to do in this course. So by slowing down sticker questions, I can check whether or not you guys are understanding what I'm saying? And it provides me feedback during class. Elsa is in critical thinking has put something up here. I'll talk about a topic and then I'll have you all apply using clickers And discussing with each other and then displaying the results up on the board. So it allows you to apply them in class when you've just learned it rather than weeks from now you trying to apply trying to remember what I said? I'm trying to think about it at that point. Also, it gives you a break from listening to me an hour and 20 minutes is a long time and we are all humans and that is not how our attention spans work. So this will give you a break from need running on and also how to prep for exams if you keep track of the answers you can then review these and make sure you  First and then before the exams and it should help and it takes attendance. I'm on those guest lecture days without wasting your time. You'll need to register your iclicker on Triton Ed many of you already have registered iclickers. If you do not or confuse feel free to ask in section or office hours.  Okay, next thing we talked about lecture attendance. Let's talk about discussion section attendance. It is not required. It won't be tracked there either. However assignments will be done in groups. There will be four assignments and a final project. All of those will be done with the same team of four to five people and that will be formed within section.  And then readings they'll be fine will also be discussing section and these readings I've assigned are all things that will help you become a better day to scientist and things you should be able to discuss with other data scientist. So it would behoove you to go disgusting infections before you go and discuss them out in the world.  But attendance is not required.  Okay, discussion sections switching I mentioned they will be forming groups within section. This is going to be the most complicated.  Aspect of his course, but it will be fixed by the end of this week. I think of you have already emailed me about switching factions. And I told you you can and that is still true email me and let me know which direction you would like to be your home section. If you're not one of those two people my sumption is that most of you are signed up for a section. You can regularly attend therefore. It shouldn't be a problem to form a group within that section and do your assignments and project.  But if you are signed up for Section, you cannot attend and your former group and they're fine with you not showing up to a section and you guys are going to work on your project some other time. That's fine. If however you need to search sections are two options one. You can find somebody in the section you a switch with and you can talk about swapping either need to email me that will be approved and I can track that. The last option is that you can email me this week to tell me when I switched actions, which section you're in which one you want to be in this may or may not be approved. I can't have everybody switching to a single section. That's way too much of a burden on th and I always so I'll assess this and see who can switch and whether or not they can on a first-come first-serve basis, but the boat there will be a cut off.  This is somewhat confusing any questions on Section switching.  Last thing once you're in a section and you have your group you're free to attend, whatever section you want that week. You'd approve just won't be there if we're working on projects and assignments.  All right. We'll see how this goes. It could it could blow up in my face will say okay is worth 10% of your grade. There are two exams. These will be taken and the last 20 to 30 minutes of class. They'll be multiple choice. There are five readings four of them will be great at your lowest grade will be dropped there reading quizzes associate with each reading and those are each worth 5% of your grade before the fifth one will be dropped.  Last there's a final project and that will be worth 10% of your grade. There is no final exam. You just have to submit your final project exam week.  Briefly for the assignments. I mentioned you'll be doing these with infection in a group of four to five people. You must have at least four. You can have no more than 5 people in a group and each assignment will be a portion of your final project for your final project is going to be the start to finish a data science project the first assignment is that going to be the beginning there you're going to say what your question is, you're going to find some data and that will be the first assignment and will walk you through the details of what we expect in. The second assignment will be working with that data and doing some basic programming. So you'll start to build your final project. So at the end of the fourth assignment, you'll basically have your final project done. You'll need to do some editing annual add an intro and conclusion and make sure it's a full report. But by the time your final project comes along it should not be too much work as you have done it throughout the quarter.  Can I eat week? You will receive feedback from your tirezan is and you are expected to incorporate that into your next assignment as you feel that your project your days and I still want to see the same mistake week after week. So make sure you incorporate what they give you on your feedback.  Assignment we do Friday is right for midnight and you can see on the calendar. Which ride is there. Do you will have something to do every Friday by midnight with one exception and that this week we'll talk about it how you handle a complicated analysis. I'll give you more details about this but it's a start to finish and this will be submitted on gradescope who here has used race go before.  Okay again majority that story.  I'm at to the readings again on the weeks that you don't have an assignment. Do you will have a reading to do the reading quiz will be due by before midnight and the there are five readings. You can see the topics that they'll cover their these will be discussed in section the week after that reading quizzes do so, you'll have already read it. You'll answer the quiz and you'll be able to discuss it in section sections also place to get programming practice and to work on the assignment and final project.  One more note about the reading quiz is my goal was to write the reading quiz so that it would take you just as long to search through and find the answers that you just read the thing. So my suggestion is to just read the same and then I need you to look at the Christopher see what you're looking for. But do your best to read this time do the reading assignments? It will be helpful to you and will help you think it as it is not exist.  Exam as I mentioned multiple choice and lecture on the 5th and the 12th the first one covers on this lecture through data wrangling and II exam covers data visualization through geospatial analysis and readings are fair game on there. Okay. This is a  The same thing as a calendar at the end of your syllabus, this is just to show you what topics will discuss on each day. You can see what to do on Friday is there so blue are the readings and then red are the assignments I gave you until Monday at midnight to finish the first reading since this is a shortened week and you didn't have access to it last week and that's what we discussed in section this coming week exam in green and the final project due date is also in green on the 21st of March.  Any questions here?  Okay.  Quizlet at 6 something is unclear here. There are lots of options one. I would love for you to ask something in class. You're free to ask during section or an office hours on posting a Piazza is great and really helps each other answer questions in for us to see what is confusing or what has not been clear and you're always of course free to ask a classmate and then I'll reiterate come to office hours ask a stuff there. If you're lost. We really want to help you. I don't want anybody to struggle in this class.  Kraken. This is on the service. You can read through it fully there on the bottom line is be respectful be kind do not better words. This is a welcoming and inclusive inclusive been harassing free environment act accordingly that includes in class that includes on Piazza. Remember that when you put something on Piazza that there is a human on the other end of that computer and that's sometimes easy to forget when is a screen between us the resources on campus if you're uncomfortable talking to one of us.  Okay, so I'm excited to have you on this class.  But there are a lot of you and I won't know all of you by the end, but I would love to and if you are super this last love data science want to talk more and think down the line maybe would want a t a r i a for me or want to get a recommendation from me. Make sure I see you in office hours and know who you are. Otherwise, I will not be able to write a recommendation go forward.  Okay, really briefly. I just moved here to San Diego. So I have lived in Baltimore for the last 10 years. I did my PhD at Hopkins and human genetics. I bend my postdoc and Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Vital Statistics. Both work is really bad rap. If you've ever thought about Baltimore you may have thought of I'm crying and Baltimore for sure has its problems. But if you ever get a chance, it's an awesome place. I'm happy to chat about Baltimore. Anytime did my PhD and Don Larkin Club? I studied the brains of individuals affected with autism and the controls I had data from different regions. And I analyze those data to figure out what our differences at the level of the cells in the brain between individuals autism in those unaffected.  Secondly, this was from my post office. I did my post on in Jeff leaks group. So just leak is the one back there. And you might recognize this guy here. That was Sean hand himself in this course. I can't I used to work together Hopkins and he and I are both now and the cognitive science department here in this work. I work with 70,000 samples that are from the public archives that we process and we put out into the public for public use so that people were able to use it to answer their questions but a lot of data were missing from those. So I use the data to generate predictors that would make these data more understandable and usable by others in the community.  Okay. So am I post. I continued on doing this genetics works and then halfway through I was like, hey boss. I really love teaching you should probably go do that and he said sure and that's what this pictures from going to be familiar with Center for talented youth. It's a summer program for gifted high school students. So I taught basically all of college genetics and 3 weeks and it was a whirlwind and it was a lot of work for a lot of fun. I also volunteered with art for the heart and this was teaching science and art to elementary school students. I also Court start undergraduate at the time. So I taught I'm Hopkins undergraduate intro to bio statistics and data analysis.  I've also generated online content for teaching individuals data science for free. So these are available to individuals with no background in Computing or programming on the Impala platform and it will always be free at the minimum price. So anybody is able to do this.  And I don't care. I am at San Diego and I'm excited to teach all of you and to talk data science.  But I want to quickly figure out who's in the room and I'll be able to get some more detailed information. But I want to see a by show of hands who here is a data science major or wants to be a data scientist.  I may be less than 1/2.  Who's studying to be a computer scientist?  Awesome. Okay, maybe less than 1/3 but clothes coming to science.  All right through her family's used to be the majority. All right, not even a v neuroscience.  All right. We got a few neuroscientist maybe 5 or 10 statistician who wants to be a statistician? All right. We got at least two hands.  What if your goal is to be a tech Guru and what this is the thing that people aspire to as much you can be more than one on your ladder is it again?  I want to be a CEO or small business owner going forward. All right handful of hands political activist.  All right limited there but some interest.  Something else really awesome. Yes. All right. Sorry language I thought about that last night and how I need to add that slide and forgot so I found when I went any other language.  Anybody else wanted to be something really awesome.  Did I forget?  A biochemist should have added other biology or biochemistry.  Yeah geneticist. I obviously think that's awesome since that's what I am yet.  A financial analyst has some sort of Quant surgeon very important.  I think it's awesome that you're learning about data lots of Surgeons. Do not the more and more are.  missing  awesome, okay.  So the last piece is that I want to say is I would love for you all to fill out. The survey. The link is up here. You can click on that this collects data from you that will be only share with me, but that I will use throughout the course to try and exemplify. Some of the principles will be talking about, but I really wanted to highlight this part most of the questions aside from your name are not required. This is so do not answer anything that makes you uncomfortable that data. You don't want to share with me information. You don't want me to have this will always be anonymous when I present things in class of your name will never be attached to your response, but you do not have to give me any information that you do not want to give me.  So you can complete this by the same time as your reading quit, that would be awesome.  Are any final questions? Yes.  For the reading quiz, it is just one try. That's a great question.  Yes.  Is it time to know you can start whenever you want and then you can finish it as long as it will submit at the deadline wherever you are at the point where you can start it and then come back to it another good question.  everything else  I will finish a little earlier today, but we likely won't on other days. I had to go run.  UC San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu "
