So General course reminders as everybody gets seated for 3D assignment is due this Friday and your third assignment is due next Friday.  I also set up please so assignments just a reminder. Most of you did this right do they should all be submitted his group's if your group is submitting two things. That's not right. So make sure everyone is on a single assignment when you submit to grade school section workbooks Caesar to help you get practice with python. They were previously just released in discussion. I realized another Rico's to discussion. So I posted them on Triton Ed the second one can be worked on in section this week and I'll post their answers on Trey night as well.  Just as a note that it's not really important this Thursday and next Tuesday topics have been flipped. I think it makes more sense to finish update of visualization this Thursday and then do infants next Tuesday. And the exam first exam scores are on Triton Ed. I like to present you all as much data about data as possible.

So that's what the y-axis is how many questions and then what percentage of the class got the question, right? So we're looking at a histogram and you can see that for me Tory the question somewhere between 75 and 100% of the class. Got it. Right when I'm looking at this time looking down here to see which questions I wrote that either I could have been better or topics. I could have been explained better. I'm not going to talk about this specific questions because there are a few people who were finishing up taking the the makeup midterm today, and I don't think we care for them to know you questions.  Until everybody is taking it for. Okay, is this one down here? That's almost everybody got wrong was a matter of semantics and I'll talk about that later. But this one because only a few people got a right that question. Everybody was Martha right on the exam. This question was just a bad question. Sometimes I spent a lot of time on exams and think that they're all really really great questions and I look at it series confused and realize that it was not a great question after all he's ever got that one. Right? This one here. I anticipated being the hardest question on the exam. It requires you to remember concept from two different lectures and put them together in a single question, which are always the toughest Point start driving exam. So this one has not been marked correctly for everybody. So two questions and we got right on the exam right off the bat. Everything else was greeted as you'd expect. So there were 30 questions. Each one was worth 2 points. This is the distribution of all of your scores so you can stay up here people ask on Piazza.  Play median and mean work so you can see that median for 50 points out of 60.  Anime was right around the same 49.7 with a standard deviation of 8 points the mean and the median are really close to one another and to me this is good. That means there's not a few people that are doing much better than everybody else in the course or a few people that are doing much worse in the course, which would be a problem. If you did not do as well on this as you would have like there are other things in this class to get points on but I'm happy to chat and office hours go to office hours for your ta psoriasis chat about what you're confused about and we can hopefully get everybody to do better on the second exam. I will release the questions and the answers later this week. So that every can take a look.  This was just for the fun. Well for me, it's fine. I don't know about all you I asked on a mid-course survey. How many points do you have? Any questions you thought you got right? And this is just how many you thought you got right 458 of you responded versus how you actually did if you guessed right you would follow along this black line so you can see a few people were right along where they thought they would be. They did much worse than actually did a few people did a little worse than they thought they had. So I was just curious to see how this would look and I didn't exactly know. How you all with you. Okay?  So I lost through exams have any questions about exam scores questions on the exam.  I'm going to briefly talk about the mid-course survey as people on settle in.  Thanks, everything answered the positive feedback helpful. I mentioned before that that helps me know what not to change in the future and then hear the negative feedback is really really helpful to be too. So this is the most common feedback that I got on at the mid courser babe. I'm going to briefly go through what they were and then talk about what my plan is. The first one. This is by far and away the least-liked part of the course are the readings were too long too boring to irrelevant. The quizzes were too hard. They weren't in class explanation and some people suggested that I provide interactive content rather than just the readings and I hear all of you. The readings are really important. We'll get back to that place is too fast and paces to slow. So I think as an instructor I could look at that since I some people think it's too fast some people think it's too slow. I must be doing everything right and I don't think that's the case. I think it can simultaneously be too fast and if he pays can be too slow, so  As a timer I grew up in Philadelphia that lives in Baltimore for 10 years and people in that region of the country are known for speaking very quickly. I am known for speaking even quicker than people in that place where people speak really really fast so I know this and I'm working to slow down. I'm not there yet. So I'm going to work the rest of the course to try to take more positive to give you all more time to think about it. When I ask you a question and a chat with each other same time Pace to slow. I think that overall has to do with the course that we haven't gotten to what allowed you may think alike the most exciting part about data science. So I hear you there people ask for a way to review lecture. They were confused by the programming portion. I totally understand all of the negative feedback. There are things I want classy more technical. There's an issue with the audio only podcast really briefly explain how this works before the quarter starts. I tell UCSD. I want my course be podcast it and then I get up here I go.  Is everything and I'm supposed to expect that the podcast is going to work and I'm a blow dryer that sometimes it works at all. But there's like nothing up here that tells me whether or not my podcast is going to work. So hopefully that will in the future Design Systems remember that there should always be feedback to the user to let them know things are attached correctly. I have reached out to ITT for both the times that the audio podcast Audio Only podcast happened and they are looking into it and can't give me anything more than that other people want more feedback on assignments and dislikes to get lecture, So the stuff that's actual now. This is stuff for the future but doesn't really affect you a time for the 4th and 5th reading. I already told you for the fourth reading I cut the reading in half. I'll do the same for the 5th reading we'll just have one reading there.  I'm going to do my very best to slow down and to take pauses and to let you all talk and think about the stuff that I'm saying due to my work speed speech some working on that includes programming. I think the last one went a little better. We slow down there was directed ideas for what to do during the programming portion. And so I'm still working on improving that and I've asked 48th and I had to give you all a little more feedback on your assignments this time going forward whether or not it's positive or negative. Just make sure you have some personalized feedback on your assignment.  So as of now you are halfway through the course y'all have done a lot so far and we will continue on doing dinner visualization and Analysis for the rest of the course.  We talked about descriptive analysis last lecture and say we're going to start talking about exploratory data analysis, which is often referred to as Eda.  The goal today is to explain why you should and need to do exploratory data analysis anytime. You are answering a question and to explain what steps you would do if I gave you a dataset to explore your data set.  I said I would show this for most of the lectures going forward last time. We said if you summarize the data and just calculate some descriptive statistics, how many samples do you have? What's the mean? What's the median with standard deviation? What is the distribution look like you're doing a descriptive analysis if you doubled and further and do an exploratory analysis where you're starting to look at the relationships between variables and starting to figure out whether or not what you're seeing is what you expected to see whether or not their relationships you didn't anticipate. This is now in the realm of exploratory data analysis. I give you a dataset and say that we have information from adults in the United States and they have been surveyed if you then go and see Heights that would be indicative of a child you then start looking through those people also of Ages that are less than 18 Deuce information in this data set. That is not what you anticipated. That's what he would start to find out in an exploratory data analysis.  Mention this before when you're doing a descriptive and exploratory analysis, you are understanding the ins and outs of every part of your data set.  So then we're right here in the middle of the data science process. We've talked about this up till now and then next lecture will talk about communicating and then we'll sign the rest of the time talking about how to analyze your data.  Surface, I'm from Durant. Okay, who you all read about in the 50 years of data science first reading ETA. Is your detective work? This is where you're seeing. What is in your data science how it all relates to one another. What is what you expected? What is what you didn't expect and it's your job to figure that out for your entire data set.  So anything about what can you do to tell us this is why you're answering when you're doing idiot.  More specifically when you're doing ETA it's to understand the date of properties. What are the distributions of all your variables? How do they relate to one another in doing that you discover patterns when one thing increases said something else increase are they not related? Did you think they would be related as you start understanding the data properties and discovering patterns in your data you're thinking about how this will affect urinalysis. I'm going to go through all this with examples today, but I did as you're exploring your data you'll then start thinking about what your hypothesis is has it changed now that you've seen the data and how will you go forward as you understand the data, I mentioned before that the distribution of your day to set the shape that your data takes affect how you analyze the data. So once you understand the shape of the data and how they relate you can then determine whether or not the way you intended to analyze the data is appropriate.  I got your checking those assumptions the whole time. I mention that do you have Heights of individuals that are outside what you would expect do you have ages that are outside. Our thing is coded as you expect them to be are the things that are coded differently than everything else. These are the things your checking and exploratory analysis. You're also and we're going to do this today looking at lots and lots of clots as you're doing this and while all of the parts you generate an exploratory data analysis are not what you would eventually use to present to your boss or your co-workers for to anybody want to communicate urinalysis. You're starting to see what is most important. So you're generating lots of some of which you would then use later on to show results.  At the end if you don't display your data you could do an analysis that is completely worthless and not true and should could have been avoided had you done all of this. So don't be the person who regret their analysis. I'm going to show an example of it today where if you didn't do exploratory analysis and figure out what was going on with your data set you could report wrong findings.  Any questions so far about what exploratory data analysis why you would do it?  This quote is Magic good. He's the same person. We talked about the looked at a quote from before about why we do descriptive analysis and we were talking about descriptive analysis. It's why do we take all this information in a dataset and summarize it into a number like mean or median and I was because our brains can't interpret an entire dataset just by looking at it and his what he's saying here is that straight first descriptive statistics later when we go to do exploratory data analysis removing a Step Beyond just calculating means and medians in the direction of exploring the date of fully so that we can get to the scientific hypotheses. Not just word of the day to look like but how are they all related to one another in the entire data set?  Okay, so when you're doing an exploratory analysis the first thing you'll do and we talked about this already is look for missing values and look for outlier values. So do you have missing data is that at random if people just choose not to answer a question or is there a reason why you're systematically missing information about some of your individuals in your data set?  You also looking for outlier values are people Way Too Tall or way too short for what you expected. You're calculating those numerical summaries. So you still do calculate descriptive statistics your means you're mediums or standard deviations you look at what's the most common and you generate plus now to start exploring the relationships again tables still count Prosser great tables also are helpful in exploring the relationship between variables on this is grayed out cuz we're not going to talk about it in detail. But sometimes you need to transform your variable so that that data can be used to the typing out analysis you intended.  A lot of times people breakdown exploratory data analysis based on whether or not you're looking at a univariate and bivariate or dimensionality reduction. And this is just so you've heard the terms and you're familiar with them and we'll do some clicker questions to check on this if you're just looking at a single variable. This is a univariate exploratory data analysis here. You would use a histogram a density or barplot all the types of visualizations. We looked at all ready to look at a single variable.  Whether it is using too and look in the relation to variables and looking at the relationship between then this is where you would use a box plot a scatter plot a group flower pot or a fox body of one variable that's quantitative along the y-axis and then you break it down by a categorical variable along the x axis.  Dimensionality reduction is something we won't talk about a ton in his course. There's a way to take a very large high-dimensional data set and projected into a lower dimensional date is that so you can get an idea of what's going on globally throughout your day today, but only looking at an access or two, you don't need to know the details of this. These are something called PCA I say and clustering but it allows you to get a snapshot of the entire day when there are lots and lots of variables and lots and lots of observations just by looking at a few dimensions of data.  Forget about it. We five area trees dimensionality reduction as all possible ways to do exploratory data analysis.  As a cautionary Tale the reason that we don't just look at descriptive statistics is here. So what if we considered a dataset that had 11 observations were one variable had a mean of 9 the other had a mean of 7.5 and a standard deviation was 1.23 and the correlation between them was 2.8.  Those data seems descriptive statistics might look something like this where you had your 11 points and you can see that as one increases. So does the other name of this somewhat linear relationship between the two?  Those same descriptive statistics also describe all four of these data sets. So this one is linear. This one is not as we have the curve here. This one is driven by a single outlier and here almost all of them have the same value in X. I'm a different reason why except for this one outlier over here. So this is why we generate the parts because the numbers don't tell you everything you need to know how the points are actually distributed exploratory data analysis drawing of lots looking at what the data actually look like is what allows you to avoid making incorrect assumptions.  Okay, it's a general of exploratory data analysis. We do this to look at a distribution of single variable the relationship between them to get a real sense of how I date is that all fits together? So I'm going to use to explain to you how to do something. Use 3K side is today. The first one we're going to look at a bunch of plots from a large dataset and it came from the castle machine learning and data science survey of 2017.  So this is an industry-wide of the data science Industry survey where they had more than 16,000 responded and they had up to 200 28 multiple choice questions that they could have answered and you say that we're going to use today. This is a quick snapshot of it because the individuals are in Rose. We have any information about gender country age a lot of stuff about employment how individuals learn the skills. They needed to be a data scientist what their current job is whether or not they're employed what languages they use what tools they used to all this is included in some 200 questions and you were given the data set and asked to do something with it. The first thing you want to know is really what's in there and what information you have. So is it going to work if I'm going to show a pot and then I'm going to give you all a a minute to look at it figure out what's going on. I will come back to that in a second and I want you to ask yourself three questions talk to your neighbor. What did axes represent what is a general pattern and is there anything?  Tell me about the spot and then we'll talk about it will come back to the clicker question. So I'm going to do a lot of asking you all to respond and less with the clickers today. So I think about these and then be ready to explain in a minute what the ashes represent what the general pattern is. And if there's anything funny about the plot.  All right, who's ready to start explaining what the axes represent? I would love to hear from lots of different if you today but I know it can be scary to answer questions in front of lots of other people. So I'll never call anybody that doesn't ever hand up, but I would love to hear from lots of different people. So where the axes represent.  Ada, okay. So ages along the x-axis here and then County or do you also want to tell me the general pattern?  Okay, so there's a lot of people clustered around twenty-eight or somebody else. Will you tell me anything else that they've taken away from this spot?  Yes, okay. So there are no really young people. I'm going to say you really young is like less than 16.  That is okay. So there's not really many people down here. Very small bars here. There are few, but not very many. What else did you conclude from this?  There's a spike around 50. So that's one of those. Is there anything funny so that should stick out to you as OK Swedish General downslope, but we do have this bike here and I'm at a point that we have somebody up here who is a hundred which might be somebody who is a hundred and it might be somebody who enter their age because I didn't want to be identified. These are survey data. So we can't verify that ever be answered truthfully. We know from the data from this class that when we ask height, I think I was well Maria somebody say they were 666 in you don't have to answer truthfully in a survey and that's something to keep in mind. Okay. So this is a survey of people in Industry who have data science jobs. So it makes sense that we don't have a ton of young people. What do you think about the fact that most people are around 25 do we think that this is reflective of the field and we have a stance on that. I left you a vote will say if you think of this is reflective of the field and data science were most people around 25 and we have fewer and fewer.  People as we get older, so if you think this is likely reflective of the field raise your hand.  Okay, so we have more than half raising your hand and I think that's likely true. But these are the things you should be thinking about as you were looking at data like this you said is this what we expected and okay right now data science has a new field. There are a lot of jobs for younger people and there are lots of higher level jobs at 10 to go to people with more experience. So this may be true, but you need to start thinking about that as you're looking at the distribution. Okay will quickly go back to the clicker question whether or not what type of exploratory pot this is.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay. So this is in fact the univariate the only variable were looking at his age and we're looking at the count of a so this is an example of a univariate plot. Most of y'all got that and just wanted to make sure we had that terminology down.  So we have an idea that most people answer the survey or in their twenties, but we do have a range from younger than 20 up to possibly hundreds of mostly up to 80 ish.  Same thing about this one. Look at the exies. What is the general pattern? Is there anything funny about this spot?  Feel free to chat with each other.  He wants to walk me through the axes and a general pattern.  Sorry.  Okay. Okay. So I'm like the last one we were looking at count. We're now looking at percent and as you point out that it's 80% mail and then everybody else is the other 20% anyting surprising funny. Is this what you expected about this plot?  Yes.  So question is is it okay to call this a distribution even though the bottom is not a quantitative variable. So it's still how the categories are distributed so it is but I see your point there so we can still talk about the type of the categories are distributed with most of them being in the mail category.  But you wouldn't refer to this as a like a normal distribution.  by show of hands if this is we're going to have to raise your hand if you are surprised by this this.  I retrieve a few hands raise your hand if this is what you expected.  All rights, we have Ikat same as we expected a few things is not what you expected  So data, science isn't overwhelmingly male field that's changing over time. And it's something that I think at the undergraduate level we can do a lot to make sure that we're being inclusive of everybody else and not just Nails. I also want to know what that the person who generated this plot initially in their analysis. They wanted to look at how gender is how gender differences among the server responded and what they did was they just took the females in the male's going forward and this represent 16000 people, but I just want to mention that there's a hundred fifty-nine people and 74 people whose voice is the purpose of analyzing data just got rid of The Departed when you're getting rid of people from your now is that you're really taking into account on whether or not that's the right call and there was a free response for a different identity and these are kind of all over the place but there a lot of people that were removed from the analysis just by simply choose a different gender than the one he chose to analyze next next one will take a look. I know some of the font is small.  Special on this lecture cuz these are just exploratory pot. They're not supposed to be the prettiest spots you've ever seen but they're supposed to start telling you the story of what's going on with the data. So take a look at each other where the axes represent. What's the general pattern anything funny about the pot?  All right, who's ready to explain taxis in the pattern?  everyone explaining accidents  Nope, we're getting tired of this has a distribution of the relationship between the two variables with look at so far age and on the bottom of that gender select. There's one more category was in the previous. What do the people who didn't respond and there was because their information were code is sna weren't included in the other pot. So there's even more people that we had to leave out if we hadn't if we just analyzed female and male about the overall trend in age across the categories.  Similar very different a lot. Not sure.  Okay, and how did you determine that?  Okay. So you do a conclusion over there is that they're pretty similar across and they're all tending toward young. So that's what we saw in the last five that they tend to be somewhere around 28th. And then by looking at this sticker black bar in the middle, which is the median and so that is a measure of the median within group and we can see that is pretty constant. It gets a little lower for females. Do you start to get a sense that the age doesn't differ a pun with in category?  I'm up gender selection.  Okay, same will go through. He's a little quicker as we start looking at it have somebody take a look at this and let me know what they see in this plot.  Feel free to chat with each other. I'll give you like 40 seconds.  All right. What do you see here? What do you conclude?  How did a lot of people employed full-time for you look down here at the employed full-time and he looked at the x-axis and saw that there were a lot of people in this is the biggest source this probably stood out a lot cuz this is much bigger than all of this and it's over looking at employment here and you can say that the second most frequent category is not employed but looking for work, so there are people in data science looking for jobs, but overall a lot of people are employed and this is emblematic of his feet. Are there alot of jobs, like people getting jobs. Sometimes they're hard to get but they're out there and most people who took the survey are employed.  What if we take a look at this one? What are we looking at now other let me know what you think of this plant where you would like to see what's confusing.  All right. What's the difference between this pain the last one? What do you conclude? What do you see here?  What's going on?  Okay, so you're looking across so you see that it's broken down by the gender selection and you're looking right when you mentioned that female and males in your same proportionally. It's similar between males and females and then how did you determine that?  Similar shape so you're saying hey, there's fewer people here. And then more out here. Is there a way that it would be easier to make that conclusion cuz it's definitely the right conclusion, but that doesn't necessarily come through because RX taxis are different numbers here. So I'm going to suggest when you have different numbers within categories is sometimes helpful to look at proportion. So this is that same plot and the conclusion drawn was correct that the proportion is similar about 60% between males and females but higher so now we're not looking at Raw count, but we're looking at the proportion within each gender that are within each category. Now, it's a little easier to see that about 60% little lower over here are employed full-time across to the categories. So sometimes when you're comparing groups that have different numbers in those groups, it's helpful to look at proportions rather than the raw count.  I think it ever had a great a little easier to see that it's about 60% each of them when we're looking at proportion rather than raw count.  All right, so I'll open this up what type of exploratory plot is this.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so the majority of y'all said be bivariate which is the correct answer and I can see why people said this time. So let's just make sure we're all clear here. So they're only two variables that we're plotting information about even though it's broken down to five pot. What potting gender which is what each of these characterizes and then we're looking at employment within genders. Are there only two variables because of that. It's a bivariate pot.  Okay. So the last time we looked at me just look at you fast one. We looked at the count of people employed within each gender. Then we looked at the proportion if you still had to look across five different plots and make the comparison the sometimes it's helpful to put them all next to each other and we can see here is on the conclusion that he drew on the last ones by looking across if I don't hear that employment is similar across the different groups except attire for men and slightly lower for those who chose not to give their gender on the survey. So sometimes a little more helpful. There's still a lot going on here and it takes a while for us to look at this and figure out exactly what's going on on Thursday. We're going to talk about ways to improve that and to make plastic better. But when you're doing exploratory analysis, you're sitting there your computer looking at the spot you have time to figure out what's going on and look at each of the groups.  We'll do a few more of these because we haven't done one like this yet to take a look at the axes and then let me know what conclusion you draw from this plot.  All right, who's drawing a conclusion from this pot?  What conclusion did you draw?  What are the tools most frequently used by data scientists?  All right with python and then we are and then we have sequel or SQL. So these are the ones who talked about Python and R as a programming language is SQL is a way to access on relational data in database. Is there a tool that people use the Far and Away those are the three most frequently used by date is knighted.  Okay, I'll walk through these briefly. These are similar to actually already looked at over here. We have how people learned before entering the data science field where people have learned in university courses. This is increasing over time many people are self-taught and there a lot of people who have taken courses online to improve what they already know other people learned at work Chicago competitions or has some other way.  And we can look at the titles of the survey responses to what is their job title. So unsurprisingly as this was a survey of data scientists many people put that as their title but there are lots of other titles that people have and when the end they identify as a scientist, this is really just to point out that you can do data science work without having the title of data scientist Supply you interpreted them and quickly have a much better understanding of the data that we know that among the 16000 respondents. The median age is around 25 closer to 28 that they're likely some outliers party and that it maybe is not representative to feel that something would want to check on we know that it is overwhelming the mail. Also something you want to see is whether or not this is representative of the field. We know the age is similar across genders. We saw that in the box plot that most respondents are employed and that the employment rates were similar across reported gender, but not the same of know that among there for two genders males were employed at the highest rate.  Python see if i c h e r and r are the three most frequently used tools and a people learn in lots of different ways and there are lots of different job titles out there so quickly by looking at a lot of parts that you could generate a within a few minutes. You have a better understanding of what's going on in the dataset. Okay. Any questions about the categorical example?  This next one is a kind of specific one. And I don't think I would be a professor. If I didn't talk about my own work at some point in the core. So the details aren't don't matter time. You don't need to know anything about genetics understand example explain experiment very quickly. So we had autism France from individuals affected with autism and we had a brain from individuals who are not affected with autism to access controls and our goal was to look at the differences between the two measures Optical RNA levels. It doesn't matter what that is, but we just went to look at all the places within your brain that we could measure this do the values differ between individuals with autism and those who are not affected with autism and we had 71 samples and then we had a hundred thousand measurements. So the assumption is that these values wouldn't differ that would be similar across most of them and we're looking for those places of those 100,000 places where we're looking where they differ between the two with the idea being that individuals that we can start understand what's going on in the brain defect with autism if we were to carry out this experiment  Any questions on that?  Control Brands autism Brands looking for differences at a hundred thousand different places.  So this is an example of dimensionality reduction. You don't need to know details. But what this does is each point represents an individual and I'm looking at 6 different the global captures the global differences in the sample. So what you want to see is that all the points are close to one another and then he gets on distribution where nothing's really standing out here. We have some points separating from the group which catches my eye and as I look at the other dimensions, I start to see some point separating out and there's some to get far enough away that I'm confident enough to say that these are outliers. So it's far enough away from the rest of the group that I start to look and all colored and red and three different samples are identified here, even if so, this sample is the same as the sample suddenly. I see that there are samples that look different than the rest of the samples in the date of that.  And I'm going to Venn look for differences between individuals with autism and control samples. I need to know why these samples look different than everybody else and I thought to myself that cloth sample contamination could be what contributed so I know the people are in a lab and their pipetting stuff and then we're getting all of this data if samples were the mix when that was happening. What would that look like?  So details, not super important. We had two different measurements from each sample. So we had DNA and RNA and you should look similar based on what we know about biology so I could say if I take the DNA and I take this these samples hear how similar do they look to one another? What do I do if they don't look similar? There's probably contamination because we know that they're supposed to look similar.  So when I look at that and measured how similar are they between the DNA in the RNA be more similar they are close to there would be two zero and suddenly I see three samples popping out. And so this help my hypothesis. So I did is exploratory data analysis. I see these points that are different than the rest of the samples and I have his hypothesis that there's sample contamination. So I did a test that that's what's going on. I simulated contamination and I said if I simulated 10% of the samples of there being a pure sample vs. 90% I would see some pattern like this we're here because there's less agreement between the DNA RNA and here there's more agreement and suddenly I see these three samples are up here with the highly contaminated samples in my experiment.  Okay. So how do you say both of those contamination? They look different than the rest of the samples. I had to figure out why it looks to me like they're sample contamination. I'm so what would happen if I didn't remove them from analysis? I got to remember we're looking for differences between Diaz between Autism cases and controls.  Here if the outliers were not removed. So you can see here that the difference in expression is way different than everything else up here when the samples are moved suddenly the black in the red overlap with one another appear Peabody. Is there a way to measure significance that's like the worst definition of futile you ever played the lower it is the more significant it is and you can see that the P value increases here. So there's no real difference after we remove outliers are removed. This would have been reported as something that was significantly different between cases and controls when clearly it was all driven by this outlier obvious cuz we're looking at the spot here, but alright to be at a hundred thousand of these you wouldn't make a plot for a hundred thousand and look through a hundred thousand. So if I didn't know about this outlier, I would have said hey, this is something that's difference between Autism cases and controls. Let's go investigate that further. I worked in the other direction to wear. These outliers said it was less significant and then it was significant when the outliers are removed does an idea why is learn to read and  Is it so important if you have outliers and they're driving your differences you're going to report things that are untrue and you don't want to do that.  So in this example, we learned that sample contamination is likely the culprit in these three samples and if those had not been removed from analysis, we would have reported a completely different set of RNA that difference between Autism cases and controls. So if you don't do it for trade analysis, you can report inaccurate results and you don't want to do that either for your boss or for scientific research because it will make you look fat.  method  ETA is not always the answer to everything.  If you have already analyze your data and got an answer that is not what you wanted or expected or hoped to see or that would make your boss upset. You don't get to go back and start removing samples to make things look better so you can't go back and remove samples to improve the correlation or to get an answer you one or two make something significant it is this is upfront to make you understand urinalysis, but you can't just go back and start changing things so that you get the answer you wanted was a famous quote from The Economist. That's if you torture the data long enough, it will confess if you go in and manipulate things remove samples change variables transform things that you hadn't planned on transform it all of this can change your answer, but you can't do it after the fact you have to decide beforehand how you're going to analyze your data.  If I pull up to give you the results you want. It's a tool to make sure you're doing the correct analysis upfront.  I will be the same for this all use a lot of data about you all are towards the end of lecture to make the points that we've discussed in lecture. So this one I just want to remind everybody this is the data set that I collected from you all at the beginning of the course. We talked about this last lecture if there were 275 people that responded there where I think 19 variables that I've included in this data set and then here we have how many people chose not to respond to each of these categories will come back to that in a in a bit.  I want to know where my students grew up.  I asked questions on in what ZIP code were you born? And what is your hometown? So both of these could be used to answer the question where did cause nine students are up? So I want to ask you which variable should we use to determine the answer to this question?  Feel free to chat with each other and convince each other.  I'll give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  All right. We were pretty even split. Does anybody want to tell me they're thinking and why they chose ARB? Yeah.  laugh out loud, Los Angeles  Okay. So the point that was supposed to be pretty specific and but they're supposed to be large. So if you want your specific Hometown that might be a little more specific or more granular in the dataset. I like both of those arguments follow up.  So the argument here is if you put in Hometown and just put in San Diego. What if there's another San Diego in Texas or California and I didn't specify how to say it. So you could have in San Diego but we don't exactly know where that is. That could be a problem with Hometown any other thoughts attack?  you have to spend time cleaning and matching back up to where it at the end and you want to do something like a  Okay, so that all you hear is Hometown could be have typos in it. And then you have to spend more time going through seeing which ones didn't Matt back and why and figure out what they meant for the cleaning. There can be super difficult. Where is it supposed to be more generalizable and can get you the longitude and latitude pretty quickly, which is what you would want to do if you want to put them on him at any other thoughts yet.  Okay. So the argument here is that zip codes can be problematic. If you're expecting some format, like what we would use in the United States, but that is not the same format that is used worldwide. So if we specify a format we want in zip code without taking into consideration, that could be problematic.  So let's take a look.  Supreme look here. Zip code 69 people did not respond to and Hometown 25 dances. So we're already seeing that there is maybe some issue cuz I couldn't think of a good reason why I zip code and hometown would be a different response rates. They're starting to see that there might be some issue with zip code. So ZIP code here. We see a few rows of zip code. We see hometown.  How do I look at it? I'm not going to do this one because we just talked about all these reasons. The one thing that I didn't mention is a tie required zip code to be numeric on the survey intentionally so that we could have this discussion today to using zip codes. What I did was I took the zip codes map them to longitude and latitude and I counted how many people fell into the zip code and I parted each place on a map. And this is what I got. So you have longitude and latitude. We have a point where people are from we see a lot of people from Southern California with you. Lots of people are from here in central see people through out and then we see what the size of the circle is proportional to the number of people that live in that plot in that spot. All right. So what's going on here any problems with this?  Okay, so this isn't very clear at this doesn't you can't really match so we know that there more points here was zip code. We can't really see the size difference.  Any other problems with this map?  Anybody feel like their data is not being included in the state of set.  Maybe it isn't mentioned. I specified intentionally that I wanted a numeric zip code. However Canadian post postal codes do not have only numbers they have letters and numbers. So if you were Canadian, you would not be able to put your ZIP code in there. I also for that Matt utilize only zip code in the United States, which if you hadn't taken into account the fact that you were using a dataset to match for longitude and latitude that were only in the United States that you would get some problematic Matt's going on. Anybody who had a Canadian postal code would not have been able to enter their data because we were acquired it to be numeric based on our assumptions. So let's instead use Hometown. We do location based on what people said here to determine what their Hometown was anybody who had a typo here that could not be found or had a location. I was found in multiple places, but didn't specify what also a problem. But now we have a map here again. We have size of circle and we can see based on location rather than just a zip code.  Where our students come from and I think it's a pretty cool map showing that y'all come from lots of different places all over the world, but that's likely reflects more what you expected to see based on where you grew up. So this case due to what assumptions were made in data collection. We had biased information in the zip code. We would have missed people in the world where there a were not numeric but there still are those problems of your location that typos can cause a problem in the you have to go in and clean things up a little more to ensure that everything was correct. So we have a pretty quick idea of where people and caused 9 came from  All right. What if we want to know whether or not students tend to have taller students tend to have higher gpas?  Take a look at this map figure out what the axis represents figure out the general pattern and let me know if there's anything funny about this spot before your child each other. What do you say?  All right, who wants to explain to me? What's going on here?  Okay, so that other point here is that GPA 10 Samuel appears to be on two different scales that a few people were maybe on a hundred point scale or some other scale where a lot of people are down here closer to 0. So because of that can we determine what's going on with the relationship between height and GPA? That's the next question?  So what can we conclude?  About the relationship between height and GPA.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  I really pretty even split.  Welcome back to this because we're going to do something quickly.  We're pretty evenly split about whether or not there's no relationship or can't be determined will come back to us and talk about both in a second.  So you would typically want to figure out why are on different scales and get all the information on the same scale as I'm just going to look at places where GPA was less than 5 so we can start to look at those individuals were GPA was on a similar scale between the two. So here we have GPA we have height and we have each individual appointed as it as a point on the plot.  Now we done that. What can we conclude about the relationship?  every few more seconds  seems like Mason in decision on this one by a few people 3 2 1  More of you said that there is no relationship and explain to me how they came to a conclusion. What on the plant what did you look at? What made you come to that conclusion?  Okay to the docking pretty evenly distributed. We don't see so they're kind of her all over the place. They look pretty random. We don't see everybody up here and everything on here. It just kind of all random threw out there and that is absolutely correct. So there is a relationship here on the other one for those of you who said no relationship. We on the last one we had on his outlier to couldn't really determine what the relationship was because everything was compressed. Do you need to get everything on the same scale or remove the outliers before you can determine that there's no relationship and there is a physical ways in which you can put numbers on this and determined that it's pretty darn flat but the height and the GPA do not seem to be related hear certain understanding between those variables. There's a relationship between families with siblings and families with pets quickly. We've looked at this before. So this is a distribution of individuals with sibling. So everybody over here has siblings and this person these people do not  I know this is a distribution of the people in the class who have a pet. So more people habitat versus don't.  What we see here when we put those together.  What conclusions do you draw here when you take a look?  Imma show the same plot just a little differently here and see what conclusions we draw here.  What's the relationship between people in his class who have siblings and those who have pet?  Is it right the same between them does it differ who's more who's last?  I know it's getting later and class people are tired. We looked at so many grass. Okay, so we'll do it your hands on this one before you move on to the next one. So  Actual point, so do you think that more. That is the same between will do this? But if you think it's a shame that people have to have siblings also have pet at the same rate raise your hand.  All right, we got that beside the same. If you think it's different raise your hand good while still awake OK know which direction does a go go in.  Don't look at the comparison between these were looking at the proportion here. So the fact is that we're now on the same scale and we see that there are more people who do not have siblings and also do not have pets so that answers our question there.  Now this last one was because of my own interest. I asked you a question in class about how much of the information so far has been new to you. This is after the programming lecture. So these are all the topics we've covered up to that point. I showed it in class. We had this kind of flat distribution with some increase in people in the 2260 range, but for my teaching purposes it matters to me that it's not wildly different between Majors or years or gender despite this being an entry-level class. I want everybody to get something out of it. It don't matter to me if some people are not  I took the iclicker responses. So the percent new and I joined them with information from your roster. So what major you have? What use the year you are here easiest. I don't deserve a data what year you are in your study and your identify gender. So I joined them by ID or by name and then I coded the major by your two-letter code. So each major has a two-letter code, which I learned in doing it. So CG is cognitive science article gender only male and female are included in this despite there being more and the same information goes for UCSD year and major because I only want to include in places where people are more than 15 run the numbers 115 for identify ability reasons and I do to grass so this is that same thing. I just showed you we see more people in the 20 to 60% new information range. How does a breakdown by Major? So this is the only proper I'll show you people less than 15 and these are all the different majors of people sitting in this course.  Set of data science is the most common. So now when I start breaking down into categories, I'm only going to include those Majors were there more than 15 individuals from that?  So who wants to interpret this for me? We're getting toward the end take a look chat with each other and let me know what you take away from it.  All right. There's a lot going on here. What's one conclusion you drew from looking at this graph?  It's hard to draw conclusions from this that it's really hard to determine whether or not Dismount. This was different total versus it's okay. I'll give you another second what's going on same information on the proportion scale. I want to hear one conclusion from somebody in the class. So chitchat with each other. Let me know you take away from this graph.  All right, who has the conclusion? They took from this grass?  Okay, so maybe David science students based on this red orange being there for that new tend to be a little bigger than the other groups are their conclusions you could draw from this was that it would be helpful to have actual name down here because it's surprisingly I double check if he died. So easy is not economics that engineering and Ian is economics. I think or some of the codes didn't make sense intuitively with what they would be so it would be helpful to have Better Label. I think that is a great conclusion. It would also be helpful to have fewer colors cuz the colors make it kind of hard to figure out what's going on and maybe the order these in some way because he that over here. We have a lot of people in the middle range, but that's probably the place where it's the largest over here and in Psychology we have people were a lot of information is new. They're really just trying to look at the colors go across figure out how it differs from one major to the other.  I'm going to go through this quickly as we're getting toward the end that we have mostly first years in the course, but I'm leaving people that are not in the first and fourth year, but we don't have 15 of them. So they're not displayed.  If I look across the years and again look at proportions with Juniors and seniors pain twisting the information before so this is something you might expect as these people haven't had more classes here overall. And then as gender we have more males in this class than female and a distribution looks a little different here and I don't have answers as to why but we can see that male tennis Payless information was new to them relative to females. This is something you might want to break down within major with a year to really start understanding this trend we can see that more males have less was new and that female tend to shift toward the more information paying now.  Replay we live next door to right now. It says that there was for whom west of the new materials new tend to be data science NCSU Majors Juniors and males. We learned there more males and females in this course at UCSD major does not equal year in school and it showed up but it doesn't move a whole bunch of different Majors taking this course and zip code is not the whole story and with that if there any questions feel free to come up. Other than that, I will see you all on Thursday.  Thursday  UC San Diego podcast "
