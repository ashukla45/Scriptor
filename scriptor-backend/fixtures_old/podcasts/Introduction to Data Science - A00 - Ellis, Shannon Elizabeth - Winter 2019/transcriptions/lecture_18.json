    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast. All right, we're going to get started and everything quiet down.  Okay, so these reminder should look very familiar from Tuesday. You have your fourth assignment due this Friday and remember minder. This is just a proposal of what you would do what variables should include what type of analysis you're doing what you would expect you don't have to do any programming for this. It's just a bit of text explaining how you would analyze your data to answer your question. This is because we haven't gone into the programming that you need in order to do this and we haven't talked in detail about all the ins and outs of the types of analyses. So this is your best approach at how you would analyze your data to answer. Your question of Interest II exam is next class meeting you'll have a guest lecture for the first 30 minutes or so, and then we'll transition into doing the second exam at the end of class.  And your final project at Jesse's reminder? It is due on a Thursday. Not a Friday. So your capes check out the study guide and this is something I hadn't mentioned. I'll also post this on Piazza that there is no section next week. You're encouraged to go to office hours. If you have any questions or reach out to us on Piazza, if you can't make mine office hours any of our tsri is office hours were happy to help but I just don't want to waste the days and times as every city and me 10 and likely people won't show its affection. So any questions on that let me know what this is a reminder. So for the fourth assignment like the third assignment you can submit your laboratory notebook directly and you do it the same way. There's this cell at the top of the fourth assignment and you put your hyperlink in here. I just want to change this to whatever your team name is this let us know as the great that you want that to be graded and that is actually a hyperlink you updated not the one that was in there by default or to help us out if you just want your PDF.  I just delete the cells with not even in there at all. If you want us to use your laboratory notebook edit this to be your hyperlink and your team name. If you don't want the collaboratory notebook to be graded and what the PDF just delete this cell entirely any questions on that are the announcements.  We're going to jump into again. Their final bit of review for the second exam and then I'll leave it open to you all four questions if you have any so the first question is, which of the following is the Pearson correlation coefficient for this relationship.  but if you wear seconds  3 2 1  It's overwhelmingly. We have the right answer. We see that the answer is a negative correlation of .68. So in order for it to be .99 these points, we have to be very close to this line in the middle and it is a negative because the direction is going up into the last to be a positive correlation. It would have to go up and to the right. That's great pretty clear on about that.  I'm pretty clear on correlation. It looks like the next one is another inference question. You carry out an analysis and establish that the Alzheimer's disease occurs more frequently in Floridians than residents of other United States states, which of the following would be the most Leslie confounder in urinalysis.  Think about yourself chat with your neighbor.  Start a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so you got half of the class saying eh and then we have some people saying all of the others and does anybody want to defend their answer anybody want to tell me how they thought about this and came to their answer.  What if I told you that is the right answer? Does anybody want to defend their answer now?  Yes.  Okay, thank you. I even here is that in Florida that white people retire there? So the age of residents tends to be higher. We also know that all simers is a disease that tends to affect individuals of advanced age. And for something to be a confounder has to affect both the variable on both of the variables involved in the analysis. So they do here and I meant explain the genotype is something that increases your risk of Alzheimer's the alligator population and the latitude of Florida and the days of sunshine. Annually these three would just likely affect Floridians. This one would just affect the rate of Alzheimer's age is the one that affects both variables. I want to be clear that we were talking about confounding. It is something that affects both variables in urinalysis. So if you stayed on this question take a look at confounding again, look at the example we talked about in class and make sure you're clear on how confounding works and can affect and Analysis.  Nerf guns machine learning I have a bunch of Emma Jada from the ocean and I want to build a model to determine which images have oil Flex.  So what approach should I use?  Go to a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Alright, so we have a majority 68% saying see unsupervised learning and we had the second most popular answer is a decision tree. So in this example, this is something that researchers have tried to do whatever you want to do. This is if there are oil slicks out in the ocean on this could cause danger to the health of the animals there and you were going to be able to detect these quickly and reliably but there's lots of stuff going on in the ocean. So it's always the easiest to figure out what an oil slick and what's just noise stuff that happened in the ocean. So rigidly people set out to use decision trees, but this requires people to train the model and look at a bunch of images and decide what they think likely determines an oil slick and it turned out that humans weren't really great at that. So more recently people started using using unsupervised machine learning allowing the computer to determine what you're looking for to determine a true Elsa versus something that is anything but an oil slick it's not linear regression cuz that are out the variable is not a continuous variable. Remember this looks at the difference in me.  Between two groups. So that's not what we're doing a correlation looks at the linear relationship between quantitative variables and we're not doing that. So either a or C would be a reasonable answer here with seating with actually being.  I'll write a review from Albertsons. What does it mean for an algorithm to be transparent?  Think about yourself and chat with your neighbor.  Give everyone a few more seconds.  3 2 1  this is a question that test recalled. This is the definition that was from the slides and the definition of transparent. Is that those in charge or clear about? How wide is the algorithm generation were made the second most popular answer is that the algorithm is open to everyone and that was a definition for another term. So this is a true thing that you won your algorithms to be when they have a chance of harming people. I should just not the definition of  I&i last one here is you've been analyzing data science textbooks and are carrying out tfidf analysis comparing textbooks focus on the programming language are versus those that are focus on python, which of the following is most likely to be true.  Go to a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, we do have a majority saying that the word pandas would have a high tfidf in the python textbooks. But we have a similar number of people saying all the others D is the correct answer here. So who wants to explain how they chose that? So what is TF IDF? And why would he be the right answer?  Okay, so to your body if we're comparing what were the most important to one text relative to the other? So what is more popular or a word that would show up in a python textbook that wouldn't show up in an r and vice versa and we know Candice is a library in Python. You may not know and this is why I wouldn't use this exact question on a textbook that are doesn't have pandas but you would expect data science and algorithm to show up in the other text books on cuz those are all data science Concepts pandas is unique to python. So it would be in a word that shows up a lot in a python textbook teaching data science, but it wouldn't show up in our textbook.  Okay, so does anybody have questions about the material about the second exam before we move on to today's topic?  If you have questions at the end, feel free to come back. So today's topic is geospatial analysis of this is the last large type of analysis that were talking about. So we started talking about descriptive an exploratory analysis. We discussed in France and machine learning. We talked a little bit about algorithms and then went into text analysis last lecture and today our final type of analysis were talking about is geospatial analysis, like the other lecturers. We are going to go into details of how to carry out the analysis what are the types of questions that would lend themselves to do a spatial analysis and why it's a different type of analysis and its own right?  So my goal for you is to be able to describe the benefits and limitations of the ways in which you visualize geospatial data. And then also to Define explain the various statistical challenges to do in geospatial analysis of what differs when you're doing this type of analysis to when you're doing say inference. So those are the two things were going to focus on today. So briefly. Why is this a separate category while in geospatial analysis? We have to remember that were talking about locations and date of that are tied to a specific location. So Geo being so Geo being a location and spatial being they are related to each other where some things are closer to one another and these quotes on health Sunrise of everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things or whatever that is, like intuitively true. If we look at a map that the weather seems to be more similar to your next-door account to some random place in the midwest right now. I'm so when things are near one another they tend to be more similar and then when they're distant  Has a purpose of geographic inquiry is to examine relationships between geographic features collectively and she's a relationship to describe the real-world phenomena that the mat features represent. So you had this map and you know that things near each other tend to be more similar. How do we analyze the data to determine any conclusions on to describe? What going on those real-world phenomena that you see when you look at him at so that's what we're talking about. When we talk about Jesus based on how it says it's using things with places on a map or things that are related to one another in space and drawing some conclusions about them.  This is an example of that kind of really really demonstrates why you have to think of things in a geospatial on sense. So the top we have a map of the United States and you're looking at the annual daily solar radiation and the darker the orange the higher the radiation is so if we look at the map we see that it is in places in the American southwest and down here in Florida with highest levels of radiation in a second map. We have mortality rates by state of breast cancer and the darker it is the higher the rates are so what is in seeing over and over again is that rates for breast cancer mortality are highest in the Northeast where radiation is lowest and lowest down in the American southwest where radiation is highest. So it it visually shows that there are differences in these distributions and here at this would be a correlation that you would see you can't automatically from looking at this day radiation when it's higher leads to lower breast cancer rates at this would be a starting point.  Is it an observation that would allow you to design a study to them follow up and see if that is in fact true.  And it isn't just something that happens in one disease. So I showed you breast cancer. Just now. This is a map of multiple sclerosis by geography. So each state is a different color and we see the part of an S where if it's a darker color does higher prevalence and this is a disease that tends to be higher in the American Northwest and much lower in the Americans Southeast. So by looking at visual data as their map in their Geographic locations, you start to see the trends that you may not see otherwise  Well, then I want to know is that you don't always have to have geospatial map data on a map for it to make sense here. These are the same data. We're showing Ms. Prevalence of multiple sclerosis prevalence on the y-axis and latitude on the x-axis and we see that there's clearly relationship where the further you are from the equator the higher your prevalence tends to be so there's some relationship between these two variables that we were just looking at in the map when we just look at a scatter plot.  Okay, so hopefully you see why me and my son got you a special day and I'm talking about things that we measure that are tied to some location. I show you a few Maps already, but I want to differentiate between a different types of maps that people use to visualize geospatial data. So far are choropleth map. I want to highlight that there is no l in Coral plus you will find on the internet and people all the time called in chloroplasts if they say that they probably mean coroplast the core Plus Noel masks that are helpful for visualizing clear Regional patterns that show up in your data. So what do you say to hear the United States again? And we're looking at unemployment rate by County. So we've colored each County relative to unemployment in this is data from 2016. So the darker it is a higher unemployment was at the time and it's at the county level. So why you see State outlines there are multiple different colors within a single state cuz there are multiple counties within a state so choropleth Maps visualize clear Regional patterns.  As we talked about before their ways to do this well and ways to do this less well, so as we shown before these are the on the left we have what is less ideal on the right we have what is a better approach and idea is that our cognitive brains stayed at dark is where your eyes would be drawn and they are so sweet associate that with high values. If you're trying to show values from low to high it's best to pot in the high values in the darkest color over here. The reverse is seen as our eyes are drawn up here. But we then are we tend to think this means High when that's not the case, so if you're going to pot a map and use a choropleth map the darkest colors should be the highest values.  Similarly and this is what I showed you what the MS versus latitude. If you're trying to show more than one variable. It's better to just show the relationship between those variables than it is to try and make people look at the patterns compared between to Matt. So here we have income and votes for the liberal party and you can see that the patterns are similar but this doesn't really nice job showing you that the more votes the liberal party got the higher the higher somebody's income tends to be the more votes for the liberal party. So if you have two variables, it might be best not to use a map and just to show the relationship between those variables.  The next thing is Corpus Excel when you're trying to show the big pictures when you're looking at unemployment rates across an entire country. You can start to see where you have lower employment where you hire unemployment rates, but you're not able to see which Counties have small differences between them. Look at this map there if you're interpreting it the way I did I'm like, okay, there's blue and there's green but I don't really get the subtle nuances at these are different blues or that these are different greens. So if you really want people to see subtle differences, you should use a plot that more clearly expresses that so here we can see the difference between blue and green and you can still use Bluetooth separate out some countries from the others for this clearly shows that Taylor Swift Our Land and Austria have smaller values than these four countries of top of your goal is to point out the numeric differences and make sure that people get clear differences between these for this is not going to cut it. So consider a different plot type  This is a big one. I'm going to focus on this for a few slides when you're looking at choropleth Maps. You should always be looking at or plotting relative differences and not absolute numbers. So when you look at this map over here, the one that is the less-than-ideal one unemployment absolute number shows that in Florida. There are lots of people in Southern Florida who have higher unemployment numbers.  When we pop out with relative numbers, we see that unemployment rates are actually higher in Central and Northern Florida than they are in Miami what this shows and we have an idea what the shows on the on the left side.  Thank you. Also shows California. Did I say floor for any other slides that were the wrong State? Thank you. I said Florida, right? This is Ashley, California. So let's start back with that. So in California, I think I look at this yesterday. Also said Florida in my head, which is what happens. Okay. So this is the state of California, which is where we all are right now and this is shows that there are more people who are unemployed in Southern Florida than there are relative to Northern. Oh my gosh.  This is so California, California. What does this actually show?  in California  Is that a hand? Yeah.  Numbers that it's a whole kind of percentages. What do you have us a follow-up.  Great, I guess not. All right, all you're going to absolutely true submissive the population that and it just shows that there are more people down here. So when there's more people there's going to be higher unemployment, but you really want to know where unemployment rates are the highest which is what you would want to show where time out relative differences. This shows that in California in the Northern and Central Park that this is where the highest rates are rather than where it says the most people tend to be. So do you want to show absolute numbers on a map you use something called a bubble charm will get back to that. Hopefully I don't mess with States anymore, but I might okay. So this is an example of a unhelpful nap. If you take 50% of the employment activity in the United States and taught that in Orange and you've taken other 50% that is a all the blue spots and this is again why we don't just play wrong numbers because this is a population at this shows you where lots of people tend to live activity, but it's not really showing  Rates relative to how many people live there. There is an XKCD comic about this where pet peeves number 208 is geographic profile Maps, which are basically just population at the all three of these despite potting different data are the same exact map because it is just a population map of the United States. So if you're plotting real numbers are probably just looking at population if you want to understand the information on a choropleth map, it should be irate so it should be relative to how many people are in the area.  The one last thing I'll say about coroplast is that you want to General use the smallest unit possible over here. The unit is State. I really see that each state has a different different color attributed to update today summarize information at the state level and then plotted the color relative to that number on the right side. We start to get is a Nuance cuz we're looking now at a much larger is much smaller region and you can start to see that there's Nuance in here that it's not the same throughout all of Pennsylvania that hire in the western happen in the North in the eastern half. I'm not like nervous to pick Florida or California for any of my example. I'm in Texas. If not, just green everywhere. We see that it is darker on the Southern and parked along the coast and less so in the middle, so if you want to understand the new want to have to use small values for your coroplast than the larger one here on the left.  Okay, so sometimes however a bigger unit is okay. Does anybody have any thoughts as to why this is an okay coroplast from election results?  Tell their neighbor and then I'll see what y'all think so why is this? Okay to sunrise at the state level?  Are any thoughts?  Thoughts as to why this is the right unit for these data.  How does this require some knowledge of how voting systems in the United States work? So I know if we don't have that would be hard to determine but here are the votes from a state get attributed to a single candidate. So by definition all taxes votes will go to a single candidate the state will either be red or blue. We were talking about electoral votes. So it would not make sense. If we're just trying to say which state which ended it to colorless and any smaller of units, but if your question was understand how many people in each region voted for each candidate then you would use something a little more complex. This is neither the same day that just part it differently. This is a bubble graph and we're talking about Bubble graph. The size of the circle is relative to the number of people that that color represents.  So you can see voting patterns where it is blue. If a candidate voted for the Democrat and read for the Republican and that the bubbles 10 GB bigger where there are more people living. I mean, we see the same information and can draw similar conclusions from this last part that we have an idea now of who voted for which candidate in which area and how many people are there? So the more. The size of the bubbles is reflective of the population and then we played the information that were interested in which was which candidate was voted for in that Counting.  This one has a few plot a few grass over going to work through and this is also about how you visualize your data. So if you want to look at population and how it has changed you could look at this on a map. So Jordan everybody if it is a dark blue and has declined the most if it is a dark orange, it has grown the most so this is a population change over time. You say that in Berlin, there's been an increase in population and the same for in Luxembourg. But in the rest of Germany, we see population declining generally in France. It's kind of distributor all over there's a lot of orange but there's also a fair amount of blue but it's not necessarily surrounding car. So you start to see all the Nuance of what's going on when we look at the municipality level.  If we brought those same exact data using Regents, we start to lose some of that Nuance. So we still see that France has that blue band but it's a lot of orange in Eastern Germany. We still see that Berlin is orange relatives all the blue. So we still have some of the Nuance but we start to lose a bit of it and if we do it at the country-level most of the Nuance is lost. So France, we don't see any of that blue anymore because we're summarizing at the country-level and we still see lots of work has had a large change and then any of the Nuance in Germany that we saw before is gone. So the decision you make just like we were talking with all of these relations visualizations alter what your viewers conclude so here he would conclude that growth and decline differ by country where we saw a few slides to go but that wasn't the case that it was pretty nuanced. When we looked at the municipality level the only place where it seems pretty clear it in Germany out side of Berlin.  Focus a bit on color for a few minutes just so that when you're looking at is coroplast Max, you know, whether or not it is telling the story well or and when you're generating the future, you know what to consider. So again on the left not ideal on the right more ideal. This is what we've been talking about. Is that for low numbers you want my light color and for high numbers you want a dark color when you use diverging colors hear people think this is one group and the blue of the different groups on the last one. We saw that blue and orange that made sense there. We had Divergent we had decline with girls. Those are two different things. So we one of those to be orange and blue here if red is just a lower number than blue you really want to use a color scale from light to dark.  I want everything to go right thing that all maps should be light to dark. So I want to make sure I made it clear that if you have a gradient you want to highlight the high values. That's when you use a light to dark and you don't use all the colors of the rainbow because people will then only see this middle part in the red and get confused by what's going on everywhere else.  But when you do have two things like decrease and increase in population, those are diverging Concepts and you want to drive attention to the extremes of the scale that is when you use two different colors scents that in the center of the country. I'm you get the red values where it's on the coast you got the lighter color. So sorry. This one does not make it as clear as this one that you have darker colors in middle and a different value for everybody on the coast.  I think this is one we talked about if it is just two categories and it makes sense that is either red or blue. That's the case where you just use two colors and example here is winner-take-all State elections.  Can color blindness has to be considered if you can't tell the differences on the left hand side that is okay. The thing you should use to not affect color blindness is on the right hand side. So when we focus on most so far is red green color blindness, not the most common don't use red and green to compare different parts of the map.  Okay, well went through that we talked about the types of colors which states are where on the map that I'm still apparently working on how you should use color going from light to dark when you should use diversion color. The fact that choropleth maps are used to look at rates rather than absolute numbers and any questions on any of that so far.  So talk about coreplex. There are lots of other types of maps and we started to hint that there are Bubble Maps also coreplex as we talked about show how much area was affected first Archer said that relative rate and we're on the country that is affected. But if you want to answer the question how many people were affected that's when you need a cartogram or a bubble map.  So they stay here we can kind of still make out that this is the United States maybe if you're told it but you're starting to lose the visual aspect of what were used to looking at. So it's hard to see there are more people here and more people up here and these people were greatly affected but it doesn't you start to lose some of that Matt that used to looking at so their balance is here, but if you want to answer how many people were affected of choropleth is not the right visualization for you.  Here is an example of why we need cartograms. So this is a quarter plus all of the world as we expected and we colored it by the area that our country is covers of each country. If it is red. If it's a darkish pink is way too big and the other side of the scale is way too small. So it wouldn't everybody Tanzania is one place in the world where the size of the country pretty much mapped to on how many sides of the country map to how many people are there, but you can see in Canada. So it's a dark dark pink. That's way too big relative to how many people are there. So we look at the map here we can see that most of the world is either too big or too small relative to how many people are in that part of the world. And this is why we need chloroplasts if you want to look at how many people try. This is why we need cartograms. You want to look at how many people were affected?  Alright, so here we have a cartogram and you can kind of make out the world here and he replying to share of people using the internet. So the size of a square is relative to how many people are using the air in that spot and then it's colored by the sheriff people using the internet. You can kind of make out that it's the world that you can you're losing. That's what you expect of a map cartogram, but you're able to see how many people are affected you can clearly see that the most people are affected over here in the East and that they share of the people using the internet differs in many parts of the world relative to many parts in the West.  Saint Anthony's trade-offs. You don't need to memorize this you don't even know all the difference between cartograms and geographical Maps like Cora flex, but know that if you want people to be able to recognize the position and shape. Do you want to look like the country they're expecting to then you need some sort of geographical map. But if you want things to be able to be compared an accurate, that's when you start looking at cartograms when you're looking at actual numbers.  OKC core plus we talked about car brands which are average and bubble charts are version of those last night to make sure that everybody had the term in their mind or ice a redneck rap Maps. You see this when you watch the weather and here it is information that is plotted without related without taking consideration into which state is where information just bought it with that in the background. So I mean by that is we have is smooth and continuous. So these lines happened to fall over different states with the states don't constrain what information is where so they shows are showing at the patterns as a exist across the United States, but it's not summarize within one state or one kind of one County within a state. So it's just a smooth measure that you put on top of a map. So these are common for temperature or elevation or rainfall.  All right. So we're going to test all of your knowledge now about the ways you can visualize information that is geospatial. So you want to visualize how many people were affected by the flu this past season in the u.s. What would you use?  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Italian 57% saying cartogram with coroplast being the second most frequent. So here I wanted to visualize how many people were affected and if you want to visualize how many people were affected not just what area was affected that is when you would use a cartogram you want to see which states have the highest rate of the flu. That would be a question for a coroplast.  I wake you when I get to lies to rain across the u.s. How would you go about doing that?  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  ISO 59% saying isorhythmic grass and that is the correct answer when you're talking about to rain here. You have the map in the background, but the train isn't constrained by States or the size of a county which here in core plastic are grammar summarizing some information within a region in three. We just put the information on top of the net so that's a nice a redneck crafts.  I ain't going to visualize the relationship between income and years in school.  perfumer seconds  3 2 1  All right, we have a wide winter here with scatter plot. So you are looking at two quantitative variables in the relationship between the two of them in order to look at that on a choropleth. You would have to have two coroplast where you compare visually back and forth and a scatter plot is really where you would want to see that so you can see the relationship clearly in one single grass.  And I could as last time you went to visualize unemployment rates in the US.  a few more seconds  3 2 1  Okay, and here this is where we started when we looking at rates of things rather than absolute numbers that is appropriate for a court of law for looking at one single value. And this was the map that I showed you. The first of choropleth map is what you want to use when you're looking at rates across a Mac.  Are any questions on good practices for visualizing chloroplasts when we would use a choropleth versus a cartogram versus a nicer with McGrath?  Alright, so now we talked about how you would look at the data and what what types of data were working with on but we haven't talked about why this is an entirely different type of analysis and to do that. We have to talk about spatial statistics. So we talked about so far. So these are correlation or t test or linear regression. They don't work. Well when you're starting to talk about things that are related to one another in space to go back and look at the assumptions we talked about in the inference lecture, you'll see that spatial data violates the assumptions we talked about their  Tell about opportunity we have is to be able to look at data and the relationship between data and a new and interesting way but that also requires that we learn new approaches. So we have to start thinking about things like distance. So how does something in 5.8 differ from something at point B and if you're further away, how does that start to affect it which is something we haven't talked about any other types of analyses. We haven't talked about adjacency. So something being near one another near noticing. How does that affect their relationship between those values and the interaction that occurs because of that and how Neighbors being more similar to one another then somewhere distance. And how far is something a neighbor? How far does that similarity go is something we just haven't talked about another analysis.  So the reason you need special statistics at all is because they just make sure they don't violate all of these things that we're going to talk about. So their spatial autocorrelation modifiable areal unit problems and defects which is also known as the boundary found the ecological fallacy and the non-uniformity of space. We're going to walk through what each of these is to make sure they were on the same page as to why it is to get an entirely different type of analysis.  So we're talking about spatial autocorrelation. We talked about autocorrelation in the inference election example, I gave where the fact that you couldn't use regression for stock prices because those were autocorrelated the value of one day is correlated with the value on the next day. So they're not independent of one another hearing the same idea except your autocorrelated in space and a good visual to think about this is when you're talking about New York City population what's going on here at this point is very similar to the points around it. But those change as you move further out on so the data from locations near one another and space are more likely to be similar to the data from locations that are remote from one another and places where they say you can think of is that the housing market houses in a neighborhood 10 to an increase in price or decrease related to one another elevation change. You don't have one point that is a mountain and right next to it. You don't have a mountain if there is a relationship amongst them over space and temperature is the same idea. So when you think about the fact that things near each other  Are related to one another and those are correlated with each other more than a distant remote area. You're talking about spatial autocorrelation.  Another big problem that talks about a lot and spatial statistics is modifiable areal unit problem. So I showed you all these core-plus that were either summarizing at the state level or summarizing at the county level, but those units that I use are somewhat arbitrary, right? Like we as humans decided what states were it's not something that is defined by the data, but how we decide to summarize information affect the results of a urinalysis so the aggregation units so the state the County however, you're deciding to aggregate the data are arbitrary with respect to the phenomena under investigation. If you are looking at employment, it's likely doesn't just affect a state all the same way or going to Define it at the state level does aggregation units user going to affect the statistics determined on the basis of the day to report in this way and we're going to show a show a picture about this in a second. So the special unit. So how we Define what we're going to Sunrise over in a particular study were specified different late. You might observe very different patterns and relationships. So, what are you  Buy that here. We have the same space. So think of this box as a map. I could Define the units using these squares or I could find it using these lines and if I summarize the information in this region or this region here, it would give me a different answer then these summary that I would get from what's on the left. We are the arbitrary the Divine we have these weird old map lines that we've decided as humans and I'm going to start trying to draw conclusions from them. So the how you draw all those mats matter.  This was an example where I showed you before where we to find them at the state level you could imagine that this date of this map would look somewhat different if we did it at the county level.  I'm a good real-world example of William AUP is a problem is gerrymandering if you are unfamiliar with your Twitch gerrymandering is it is how the government decides who votes in what district?  And there are lots of ways to do this fairly and there are lots of ways to do it unfairly. And we as a society have chosen to every time a different party gets in into Power continue to do it unfairly to the other people as if you had 50 people wear 60% of them voted blue and 40% voted red. If you wanted to perfectly represent these individuals you would put all of these red people in one District always another and then each of the three districts would be blue blue districts and two red fluids.  You can do this in a compact, but unfair wise what if we do the lines of that this was a district and then this was a district. This would result in all of these districts voting blue would win but it's unfair these people aren't getting represented.  What is neither compact norfair? This is what we tend to do depends on which party is in power. We decide to draw he's like really wonky lines so that if you are a Democrat and you see that white people in one area going to vote Republican you like what we're never going to win that will put them all together. So that votes red but then will grow wise as elsewhere to make sure that we maximize the blue and then went our changes a shift and they try to adjust these lies to make it more favorable. A lot of these cases have gone to the Supreme Court in the last year, but really at the core of this is the fact that there's is modifiable areal unit problem that you're not representing things by any real means you're just arbitrarily drawing lines in the real world this these are the congressional districts in North Carolina. So you can start to see that crazy lines have been drawn like there's no reason to think that this person down here in this neighborhood. We be more similar to this person up here. It has just been gerrymandered to everybody's Chagrin at this point. But if you were to optimize compactness, you would get things that make a little more sense.  Listen to think that these people might be more similar more so than what was on the last one where these lines are drawn in crazy ways. So there's a lot of math behind people trying to draw the lines for undetermined districts that people have been proposing and these mathematicians have ended up having to talk before Congress, which is something that mathematicians to not too often have to do this is a really good example of the modifiable areal unit problem in the 2000 election and the 2016 election where in the 22,000 election that is single County could have had a different County a different outcome and it would have determined the presidency differently.  So we talked about Mau pay we talked about spatial autocorrelation to space autocorrelation is where you have things that are near each other are more similar and they have correlated values. We talked about the modifiable areal unit problem when you're starting to summarize your drawing of arbitrary lines and you're going to analyze data within that are retarded spot and that your results would change based on how you draw those line.  The next one is the boundary problem too often. We just take a bunch of data and we take them all of Independence. So measure from person a is different than measure from person be but if you're summarizing information using that map we should have before and you're summarizing everything in a to have one value and everything in it to have a separate value. You're not taking into account the fact that these people share a boundary and that these people are going to tend to be more similar on because they share this boundary. So that is something that has to be taken into account when you're analyzing geospatial data.  But I started using the same idea here is the ecological fallacy CT collage of a fallacy is a situation that can occur when a researcher and has his makes an inference about an individual based on aggregate data for price of t r i summarize and I say that there is crime rate here and then there's a different crime rate here and it's a different crime rate here and then I go back and I try and save for this individual because they fall in this area maybe one of these do they have that specific are more than they're more likely to be a criminal relative. Everybody else. You can't do that. You have to understand that you've summarized and aggregate for this region and that doesn't apply to a single individual and you'll hear people I'm try to do this a lot on the news where they Brothers crime rates are higher here. And this person's been more likely to be a criminal which isn't how this works.  So you might observe a strong relationship between income and crime at the county level and you might see the lower-income areas are being associated with higher crime rates and you might conclude that lower-income persons are more likely to commit crime or low income areas are associated with higher crime rates are low income counties tend to experience higher crime rate. These would all be examples of ecological fallacy. You can't go back to the individual level.  Political hair results from aggregated data, if you're summarizing at a region level you cannot apply them to individual people. So it said Beware of the process of aggravating or disaggregated data that is concealed or variations on that would be visible at that would not be visible at the larger aggregate level.  The next point so we talked about autocorrelation. We've talked about Mau P. We talked about the ecological fallacy. I may be missing the third one on the fact that people share a boundary has to be taken into account when you talk about space.  The last one is non-uniformity what it is looking at a map and you suddenly see that there's a bunch of crime occurring in this region.  You might assume that there's higher crime rates there.  What if these were all where the bags were cuz Banks tend to show up in the same spot and bank robbers were sequestered but that's only because the banks themselves are together. Non-uniform it is that people don't put up places randomly. There are streets that are full of houses and their streets that are full of businesses in their areas that are Financial District and by the fact that we put things in places in a non-uniform way that is not randomly distributed affects how you analyze spatial data. So this just tells you the banks are here and that these banks that they extended it robbed in this area and not that there is higher crime their relative to the rest of the region.  All right on through those I'm going to have you all take a look at what's going on here chat with each other and explain which of these Concepts is going on.  Are there some dissension amongst the vote? So I think you all should chat with each other and decide if you want to change your vote talk with each other. What's what are we looking at? What's going on? What are the conclusions you're drawing?  and change your vote if you feel the need to  I'll give it a few more seconds and then I'll have y'all describe to me what's going on.  3 2 1  All right, before we discuss exactly what's going on. What am i showing you what's going on up here?  Let's break it down. What did you learn from this left hand side?  What variables are we looking at? What date are we looking at? What's the answer to the question?  Yeah.  Tourism app that gives different so the water each differs based on region. Okay. So we have some GI illness rate and then we have the average water age in that region and we see some relationship between them explain what's going on on the right hand side.  We're going to take a vote as to whether or not these data on the right hand side are the same or different than a data on the left hand side to raise your hand if you think they're the same.  We got a few hands right behind you think they're different.  Are we have a few hands which means that we are getting sleepy at the end for some of us may be. Alright. So what's worse. Make sure they were all getting this concept here. So the question I ask is our today to different or the date of the same.  The data here all these points on it within the square fall in the exact same spot on the left hand side. We've summarized it within a map region and over here. We've summarized it using a square grid so that all of the points in this region would be aggregated together where these would be separate when we see is that when we change the unit of how we summarize the data if we plot the results we get a very different answer. So do you use this map we see that ate their water age in a region is correlated with the rate of illness, but over here, we don't see that when we use this Square grid. So is that explanation? I was talking through I'm going to allow you all to revoke. I'm on it. So what explains what's going on here?  Give it a few more seconds.  3  2 1  I thought we had some more agreement that we had more than half the class saying that this is a modifiable areal unit problem, which is what it is. So what's going on here? Is that how we Define the regions where we're going to summarize an aggregate or information and then plot it changes our results by using this region definition of an area. We get a strong relationship by using the square. Grid. We don't see relationship. So when changing the unit changes your results or how you aggravate your formation that is and that you paid  Are the next one in Baltimore Police spend more time in a few neighborhoods crime rates are higher in those neighborhoods. What explains what's going on in there?  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  this is what I anticipated. So it's similar numbers of people saying ecological fallacy or non-uniformity. So we'll talk about those two last just make sure all the correlation would mean that weird you have to take him to the fact that one neighborhood say has similar crime rates of The Neighbor Next that we're not necessarily getting at here and how we draw the regions which we're going Saturday over which is not what we're talking about ethics has to do with that boundary problem that we have to take into account the fact that people along the boundary or more similar. I'm overdoing analysis. So that's not exactly we're getting at here. We're getting at here is the fact that there are more police in certain neighborhoods and the crime rates are higher.  The reason is not ecological fallacy is cuz I'm not trying to say anything about an individual in that neighborhood on thing is there is a neighborhood and there are more police there and there are more the car has higher what goes on in Baltimore which if anybody's following the news in Baltimore right now. There's a whole lot going on with the police that are really really concerning but the idea here is non-uniformity the police are there in a spot and then I see more crying because they're already there and why is it being a cycle that you see an increase due to the fact that delete people at the police are in an area? You can't really determine how high the crime rate is just because there's a non-uniform amount of people of police in an area the issue here is the fact that there's a non-uniform distribution of police and they tend to go to a neighborhood more and detect more crying because they're in that neighborhood at the time.  This is a thing that also happens at Trader Joe's just opened in a neighborhood nearby homes are now worth more money. What is this an example of  give me a few more seconds.  3 2 1  I3 almost majority saying on a spatial autocorrelation so that that is in fact what's going on here at the house is all nearby because they're all correlate with each other 10 to increase at the same rate when Trader Joe shows up in the neighborhood. So they're home value is now all correlated with with one another due to the fact that Trader Joe's just showed up in the neighborhood. This is an actual thing that happens when Trader Joe's Trader Joe's is super interesting if anybody wants to look into it more. All right with that that is everything up to be covering on a second exam will have the guest lecture on Tuesday. Feel free to ask any questions you have before you head out today.
