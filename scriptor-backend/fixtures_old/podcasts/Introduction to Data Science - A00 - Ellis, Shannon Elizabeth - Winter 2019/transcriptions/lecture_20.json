    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Play Welcome to the last day of cause 9 or so more cookies up here. Feel free to get up at any point during this and have a cookie and whatever's left the pan come up and get it and take it.  I feel like it's probably a stressful time for a lot of you and luckily for you all when I'm busy. I spend a lot of time baking which is counterintuitive. So I spent an unusual amount of time baking this past weekend and you all get to eat it so that it's not sitting in our house, but it's only two of us. So feel free to come down.  And just like we normally start will start with reminders. Your final project is due Thursday. I did send out a Piazza announcement for the serving for the end. It's really helpful, especially for those who have already participated in the other surveys for me to get a full picture on so everybody who has time. I know it's busy if you have a few minutes, it's super super helpful and it's extra helpful cuz I went through responses today and somebody pointed out that I had mistakenly not put the background example on the finals laboratory notebook up to like that one cuz I want to hear th I've been doing all of the examples and I think he did a stellar job. And of course then I dropped the ball on this one. So if you order me to copy the background isn't in there if you make a copy of the example is in there for the background for your final project. So feel free to go back to the link if you already made a copy, I'm so super fish ate all the responses so far. I'll leave it open for a week or two.  I'm keeps coming out. I would love to have a super high response rate.  All right, so we covered a bunch in this course of the last lecture is just about the future of data science over to talk about the field as it currently is what you all have accomplished and then what the future holds for data science in a few of the things that are going on that'll happen in the future most likely so we're just going to start with where are we now I'm going to be showing you a bunch of data from a report that has been going on since 2015 and it was initially by a company called crowdflower. If you see these like dark background pictures those the ones from the 2017 report they change their static a bit for the 2018 and are no longer name crowdflower the date and I'll come from Figure 8. It's just a rebranding.  And when you think of all the things we talked about the score so far whether or not these are good visualisations and think about the date of that they're showing so here we have 2015 and 2017 and what they're showing is at 25% and 35% of the data scientist that they surveyed in their report. I've been on the road for less than 2 years which suggests that people are either neither roll or new data science completely. So there a lot of people entering the field. It is a new field on Thurman to point out that there are a lot of people that are new to their jobs just like you all will be the first time you enter into the field.  And the reason that these data are collected and that people talk about data science as the sexiest job of the 21st century after the fact that you were here. So this is the second or third year in a row data science has been rated the number one job. And the reason isn't just that people make a lot of money, which the salary starting at the median salary is pretty high. It's also because there are a lot of job openings. There's a lot of opportunity. I can't be the best job if nobody can get the job and also people that job 10 to be happy overall. So these are data from Glassdoor.  The one that I think is particularly important and helpful is the fact that people who are data science tend to be happy or very happy and that's increasing over time. So this is a report from 2018 to this is the most recent report from data scientist. And we're seeing this upward Trend when was 90% of the people who respond to a survey or data scientist said that they are happy or very happy in their role as a I don't really care. If a ton of people make a ton of money if they're miserable, so it's great that they're making a good living and that they're generally happy.  Another point is that people who are currently employed in the data science field are constantly getting recruited to other jobs. So more than 90% are almost 90% of the data are recruited are called at least once a month with some people getting contacted several times a week with that being actually the most common. So if you're in the field and you're currently are in high demand, if you're already in the field, it's more difficult by Sean talked about on Tuesday to Baby break into the field. So there's projects and approaches as he talked about to get into the field. But once you're in there, you're a highly valuable at this point.  And this is something also from glass door that we talked about a bit. So these are the skills listed in the job postings for data science drop the top three won't come as much surprised you the 72% of the job postings are looking for somebody or never mention the word of python only a few percentage last mention the word or the skill are and I'm here 51% mention that they wanted us some people experience. I would gather and this is just a guess that you expect to be excited and no sequel or become familiar with it. Once you're in the position. They just didn't put it in the posting another number of other technologies that have to do with either scaling or statistical analysis or data visualization.  So I mentioned that they do scientists are in their positions. There are lots of positions those that are there are happy. But what is it that makes them happy so they looked at what takes up the time and was the Day's Night is so this is from the report from two years ago. And I mentioned they had some interesting visualization. So here they have a stopwatch and then their pie chart is in the middle of their time and they show that and this is something that we talked about the 51% of their time is spent collecting labeling cleaning and organizing data and they spend less time actually answering their questions of interest and 8/8 percent is other I was just here that is included meetings and Communications like prison presentation this whole pie chart would look a little different and that's just not one of the things include it so often as page talk about in her guest lecture, you're talking to stakeholders you're talking to your higher-ups you're talking to marketing you're trying to explain your analyses that you've done to others.  Sophia may be the most eccentric visualization. I'll show you this one here doesn't really apply to the data described to the David and principal cuz there's a lot of Ink on here that doesn't really show you any information. So what they asked in the survey was the three tasks you enjoy the most versus the three that you enjoy the least and then you can see those along the bottom. So we have is collecting data sets cleaning organizing. So you're doing and getting your data over here and then you have your modeling data and asking questions and here with this rainbow bar with these unicorns on top. These are the ones that they decide to said. They enjoyed the most I want to see the skeleton over here. These are enjoyed the least and so this is a common theme with in data science is that people like getting the answers and like having to do the work to get the answers a little less. I'm going to propose doing I've been trying to I'm going to work on making even more interesting next time to say that this this doesn't have to be as boring as you make it out to be if you are set out to understand your data that more than anybody else.  In the world and to find things that could be wrong. I think of it as a puzzle. It could be a lot more fun than we make it.  So aside from what people spend their time on what makes them most exciting want to talk a little bit about the types of data that data scientist 10 to work with this is from the 2017 report where they asked at a significant amount of your work involves, unstructured data service bars or unstructured data set easier images your text your videos where as structured Ada County Nurseries your spreadsheets. Most of the time people said I was about half and half where a significant amount of your work is all done structure data about half spent most of their time with structured data, which is what we focused on most of the time and its course.  That's the question a little differently in the most recent report. And their question was do you work primarily with structured or unstructured data on acid this way primarily people said that they work with structured data for the type of data we can talk about in this course was 30% work with unstructured data.  When they been looking at what types of unstructured data people work with the most most frequently. It was texting has always been a day talking about text analysis on but we didn't talk a ton about images or censored a audio or video Spencer Davis becoming more popular. We have wearables you have Fitbit Apple watches and people are sending out sensors to gather data from individuals all the time. I'm so there lots of unstructured data the data scientists tend to work with  This is also just a bit about how do scientists in the field get their data most companies have system setup where they collect data from their users internally or they generated from internal systems based on how you interact with the system. What do people do collect their own data sets and use publicly available data and sometimes companies will have data scientist to work with the data that another company has collected. So that's outsourced collection.  All right. So Sean's meant to say talking about how to get a job in data science. And he said that there are different paths that there's the tried-and-true where you get the internship. There's a hustler where you're doing projects and getting the experience based on the products and the work that you've done on your own and I both of these can be successful and he mentioned Vicky boy kiss at the end of his talked and shared a link in the slides to this blog post and her title regardless if that data science is different now, so she's been in the field for a while and she is particularly concerned about the fact that there is an oversupply of Junior data scientist. So before there was no data science major anywhere and now there is and lots of you are involved in it and it also been discontinued media hype of his eyes. So people know what date of science is now or excited. I don't know that it pays well and know that it's a good job. And so she wrote a whole blog posting. It's a long while coasting. It's a good blog post. I don't agree with everything that she says. I think she makes some good points and she said that there's a ton of Junior Talent on the market.  And so when she used to see 20 applications for a job, she's now seeing a hundred and she's heard of people getting even 500 resumes for single opening. So there's a lot of people find a job in this gets back to where Sean said it's not personal there. A lot of people interested in these positions. There are a lot of these positions, but you may not get one that you may be qualify for it because somebody else might be equally qualified for it. So her blog post goes through and said that maybe getting a degree in data science isn't the right route and suggest that you should maybe think of something else and I think that assumes that getting a major in data science only allows you to get a job as a data scientist and I think that if you have experience working with data and the skills to work with data, you probably have the ability to work in data science Rules as well as many other roles and I think that's something she didn't consider in her blog post, but she does go through and explain why it's different now and it's harder and she's afraid that people aren't going to get jobs that they're expecting to get but she says that like, it's still a great job. She still loves at the field.  Is welcoming and so she offers advice at the end of this largely Echoes what Sean said on Tuesday that if you learn SQL and learn a programming language and how it works really really well, if you're familiar with how to work in the cloud like things with working with Amazon web services that you are able to be successful and lots of people are so successful. So I didn't want to make it this job is super exciting you're going to make a ton of money and it's going to be really really easy without discussing the fact that it is getting harder but there are still tons of jobs. And the last thing I want to mention up here is that Vicki put this in her blog post and I think it's a really important note that this is hard for everyone and if you're struggling and stuff seems typical know that it's probably difficult for everybody and you're going to have ROBLOX and things some projects aren't going to pan out or they're going to hit a roadblock and you're not going to know how to solve it and that's okay. So don't get discouraged keep trying if you're interested in it and passionate about it. It might take some extra effort, but it likely will work out if you have the skills.  Okay, and this is a gif I showed before in the programming lecture and it's one of my favorite ideas at the bottom is that hard things are hard and it is under my pillow stock advisor said to me all the time. It's like if you're doing something worthwhile and that it's difficult. It's going to be hard and it's going to be worth it at the end. But there's going to be a challenge in the middle. So if you're doing super exciting stuff it's and that if it's cutting-edge a new it's going to be more difficult than stuff that has already been done remind everybody about that any questions about the current state of the field getting into data science jobs at John talked about  Yes, ever heard of the role of data designer. Yeah, so actually took out a slide about the different like types of data science jobs in the roles in this bill that would need in there. What have you heard about the designers?  Yes, it is. Yes, I do designer idea there is that as for now, it's getting the data and telling the narrative to like form your question a little bit better is that designers to as helping to guide to the project and also designing the way there would be communicated. There's also data engineers and a dungeoneer's have typically have had more DCF background Sevierville Computer Science Background. These are people that are working on the system that allow the data to be used by the analyst or the data scientist. Are there a lot of different like diversifying rolls are having a data science. So they're used to maybe a company be one data scientist and they kind of had to be a generalist. I know how to do all the things but maybe not know how to do all of them super super well and not a lot of companies are diversifying where they'll have a data engineer who knows the system data scientist who does the analysis and ask the questions and then we'll maybe have a data journalist or somebody who  Communicate it out to other people. So companies are taking different models as to whether or not they're spreading it out or they're getting teams together with different skills. So that is all happening and I'm curious to see like what models go forward and I think from what we're saying that different companies are going to continue to use different models and just going to be dependent on the company. There's from that data frames podcast that I showed once there's an episode with somebody from from the head data scientist from I Robot vacuums that like go around and I'm clean up your house. Her name is escaping me. It'll come to me sushi, if you look at the different and I Robot she talked about the way that she's managed data science mean that how that change over time and what models she has found has worked. Why can't I think of her name?  Come back to me any other questions about jobs in data science.  Show me to take a quick journey through what you all have done. And what's going on here at UC San Diego. We talked about the field. Let's talk about what's going on here. But am I science major is still new lots of you are in it and there's been a lot of changes that are going on within the major trying to get soon as funding so they can pursue these projects are they have the portfolio going on there scholarships for undergrads to work with faculty and they're trying to make sure that students have money to go to workshops or conferences or to bring in guest speakers to the baby get experience to a wide array of different people with any Institute. They're working really hard to find people with very background. So data visualization machine learning software Engineers to make sure that they have all of these varied experiences in the same place that you were students can talk with them and looking and considering hiring a data journalist. This is something we haven't talked about a time newsrooms across the country are hiring people with data science experience to work with data and incorporate data into their stories.  Arthur Davis Kind of a Pioneer in this and I've shown some examples from 5:38, but I know in Baltimore there is a date a journalist and that is a pretty small newspaper and really they're being hired across the country to know journalism and to know how to work with data and how to visualize it for the general public and also working on getting office space for data scientists and their work on an exchange program where maybe a data scientist would work at a journalist and the journalist would come work here and we would start to get more understanding of how data science journals and works cuz we don't currently have anybody with that expertise.  That's what you said here in this class. You all have gone through in the beginning we talk. Just how do you ask questions? What is an ethical question? How do we approach ethics and privacy it within a data science projects. We talked about reproducibility and Rec book ability and how to manage files after that. We started touching on programming. We didn't talk in detail about programming in this course on but we did talk about how the data would look in it. Is that where you would get that from and how to Wrangle it be then spent for lectures talking about data visualization how to describe your data and how to explore and then we spent the last couple lectures talking about how to analyze it. So we talked about statistical inference and machine learning for prediction. We talked about algorithms and gave examples of a few and the limitations to how we talked about text analysis and geospatial Analysis and there we had to guess lecture so paid featuring he came and she talked about the work she did on recurring donors from her work.  Classy, we're trying to figure out how to help their nonprofits that they work with encourage people to become a grinder and donors because they figured out every card donors give them lots more money over time ever saw on on Tuesday your ta he talked about getting a job in data science and what that takes and what it could look like.  Okay, so I wanted to thank Tas so that Jason is not here today. So Sean just so you all know that like what goes into making sure that we had a Scantron that would work and I would get everybody out grades done quickly and efficiently Rob who's way was behind putting a lot of the examples as I mentioned earlier into your assignments. Everybody did, grading and Zayn was invaded. They also help run section and degrading de Lune with one who generated the work books that were used in section by a few of you. So every helps guy get this course going and I wanted you to know they're not here to give them a round of applause and you all Round of Applause for your appreciation.  So they cannot hear that on the podcast cuz I know that a lot of them to listen to the podcast cuz they give me questions and feedback from it, which is also very helpful. So I wanted to read through the CDs and determine which of these explains your understanding of data science before and now again frequency code is a d and no answer here is wrong. All of them are valid.  cuz every few more seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so we have a lot of people saying that they knew dating signs was before but had a better understanding now and I didn't really know before and have a better understanding so as an instructor like I clearly would like understanding to increase but I don't think it is. There's anything wrong with the fact that it maybe you don't understand it as well as you thought or maybe I didn't do a great job explaining what it is to either of those would be possible and then here if you understand you didn't change. That's also totally fine. Maybe you had a really great understanding of what data science was and you still do it. So I have another one.  about  your interest in becoming a data scientist. So again, all of these are valid.  I might have follow-up questions depending upon how people answer and you don't have to answer if I'm just curious.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  okay. Lots of people interested either equally or more those Rd. NE some people in see who are interested in something else which is totally valid and don't feel that what they learn to help them. And that's great to the people. I'm curious to hear about are those who didn't want to be their scientists still don't have a data scientist and I'm curious to know what you want to be and how you think cause and I could help you. So if anybody wants to share that I would love to hear about it. You don't have to  I really want to understand what data is and like  okay, so you love Comfort Systems and really want understand how data what it what day are and how it interfaces with that and don't be scared of it. Yeah, cuz there's a lot of data out there and I can be intimidating. You know, how you what you would want to use this in so you don't have to  Interesting visualisations, and you don't need to say talking about data visualization at 2 p.m. So I can give you more information about that if anyone anybody else, so if you look that up and he's interviewing with hdsi.  Figure out how to click boom. Boom  I'm just like there's so much data is so much of the borders between understanding some funny cuz I'm getting to the truth is something where the stolen data science could be used other thoughts and if you don't want to share  but they're interested in doing how cuz I would help them totally fair.  So we talked about that people are data scientist that they make of the living that they enjoy it that they're working with tons of different data that they're answering interesting questions. And that's what they like most talked about. What we did in this park that we work through what a data science project would look like talk about the ethical implications talk about where you get the data and how to answer the question answer the question now is where we going  Solicitor from the report the two years ago, and this was a question about self-driving car. So, when do you think you'll ride in your first self-driving car and most people said within the next 5 to 10 years, they will have ridden in a first self-driving car a couple people already had but that was not the majority. So this is clearly a topic that is up and coming there's a lot going on in the field of self-driving cars and I wanted to show a few short videos today. So will this person will be about the minute?  The current generation of driverless car is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for Schumer's they're trying to learn traffic rules, which is bright to be simple and coping with human unpredictability, which is more challenging.  Which which would happen when whole cities become driverless. What do we need traffic lights would we need links? How about speed limits? They never stop at red lights in the first driverless cities. You would have no red lights and no lines and when all the cars are driverless and connected everything is predictable and reaction time minimum. They can drive much faster and can take any Russian initiative that can speed them up all the cars around them.  So instead of rigid traffic rules regulated by a massive Dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms.  The result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth trigger of German Auto Buyers and the creative Vitality of the intersections of Mumbai.  Would be functionally exuberant it would be liquid like our blood.  Okay, so I think he might be a little idealistic in this happening and eventually we'll get there so  Didn't hear interested talk about it talk about how we could model this like blood in our veins and it's an interesting talk, but don't remember the example. I talk about the elevator.  Saitek on elevator where you push the button before you get to it and when you get in there, no button for you. It tells you which one to get into people freaked out when he first started that they didn't know how to handle it here. We're saying we're going to give up all control. Let me know that humans like control over talking about driverless cars driverless cars. In fact, so we know all the data show that driving is way more dangerous than flying but flying is a way more common fear then driving people get in cars all the time. We know that's more dangerous than flying, but people are really nervous about flying.  Your thoughts here.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I thought about including that today. So I didn't talk about to the following. There's a lot going on with Boeing right now and I've been grounded and flights are being stopped all around the world because of automation. If you are in the field of flight, you should work slowly and carefully and not try and push forward to the times we can push forward quickly and try out for them that as long as it on packing light. So yeah that is a way to find can be dangerous driving is still more dangerous despite what's going on currently and it is when you're flying you're giving up control self-driving cars require the same thing too late. So don't just like assuming everybody's to be fine going to driverless cars doesn't take another fact that we are using humans here and humans don't aren't comfortable and they lose control of things that they once had control of.  So I think this point on this display, which is confusing but I'll walk through it. So they asked data scientist in green and they asked ethics professionals the same question. Would you rather drive yourself or use an autonomous vehicle data scientist? 75% of them said they would rather use it all Thomas vehicle. But 75.5% the exact same amount said the other direction that they would rather drive themselves. So I think it's afford to keep in mind that liked when you were in a data roll and you're talking to a bunch of data scientist that you're likely not getting a representative idea of how the rest of the population is. You might feel your way more comfort with automation or self-driving cars and maybe the general population and you have to keep that in the back of your mind when you're thinking about these technologies that you're super comfortable with but knowing that other people would be less comfortable with them.  Okay. So stop driving cars are clearly an important discussion that's going on right now. The technology is there were moving forward with it. And I want to do then switch and talk a little bit about algorithms. We talked about them, but I want to know how they're fragile and they're not always a human like this is a scientific paper that built a predictor to predict images and put us by images what the label should you apply to it so over here we can see that with these were all with 99.6% certainty uncertainty predicted based on their neural net. This was a starfish. This is a baseball Edison electrical guitar and are human brains looking at this day. Okay, I can see how you might think of the baseball but that's clearly not a baseball. This is not a remote control that we can see why the model may have thought that so we haven't built out and get that are able to think and see exactly the same way humans would so they're super powerful and they can do really interesting things. But if we just make small talk,  Instagram we can have their certainty obviously not reflect with actually going on.  So they're fragile. They're not always as smart as we want them to be and I always doing exactly what we think they're doing if we don't understand how they're working and wide is mistakes are happening which we often can't we're not to be able to move forward to really have everything reflect what humans see and images. This is an example of a case where this happened. So this was a few years ago. We haven't talked a lot about algorithmic trading in this course, but algorithmic trading is when computers and trade on the stock exchange and we train is out how to do it in New York City around where the trading 1/2 ton of a real estate hasn't bought up around that so that the people who servers are closest to the trading happens milliseconds faster than people that are 10 to 20 blocks away.  So he's like you were working on a millisecond scale here where it is advantageous for you to be able to trade millisecond faster than somebody that ten blocks away. So they like taking huge buildings in your city and then gotten rid of everything in, just put their servers in there so that they can do their trading milliseconds faster than the people walked away. And when you're doing is trading what happened on this day was that there was this huge drop in the prices of the stocks and to this day. We don't know why this happened the reason that it didn't continue on it because the computer did have a check on this and saw undetected sharp decrease and then stopped everything and then saw that they had recalibrated and were able to open it things back up. So they didn't have that stuff in there. If they hadn't just before whatever reason we don't know why the computer decided to allow this mini crash to happen, but it stopped because the computer detected it, but if you're not keeping an eye on this or you don't have that. This could become disastrous and we wouldn't on  Why decisions have been made we would know exactly what drove is cuz we can't even after that determine why this happened.  Okay, so I ruined your fragile. Sometimes I make mistakes if they don't really understand how they're making their decisions and they can't explain to us how they're making their decisions. They can lead to things that we don't understand but they also are powerful. So I wanted to talk about on human-based computation has everything a recaptcha before yeah, we're going to talk about them a little bit too short clips from his talk so we can chat about captchas Andre captchas.  Is a few minutes.  I was one of the people who did it. And the reason is to make sure that you would be out the form actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times. The reason is because at least non-visual encouragement from writing a program that can buy Millions tickets to at a time from the Yahoo registration page random characters that happened to be shown to the user word w a i t which of course spell the word about the best part is the message that the out help this got about 20 minutes later.  special person thought  okay now call recaptcha and then about a year-and-a-half ago from the following realization.  But then I started feeling bad.  So then I started feeling bad and then I started thinking that is good for Humanity. So that is yes, and this is what we're doing now. So what you may not know is that nowadays while you're typing in caps are not only are you offended getting yourself as a human but in addition you're actually helping us to digitize books to let me explain something trying to digitize books. Google has won. The internet archive has one Amazon Kindle books.  And then you scan it with every page of the book journey to be able to decipher all of the words in this image. That's when using a technology called OCR for optical character recognition, which takes a picture of text and try to figure out what the problem is. I O C. I was not perfect especially for older books where the ink has faded and the potatoes have turned yellow OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words for more than 50 years ago. I was worth taking all the words of the computer cannot recognize people to read them for us while they're typing a couch on the internet actually work that are coming from books that are being digitized for the computer going to recognize. The reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because you see one of the words  He's going to present it to you. But since it doesn't know the answer for it cannot grade it for you. So what we do is we give you another word for correct word for the system already knows the answer and we have one more word which type accurately so this is how the system works and basically since we released in about 3 or 4 years ago.  Okay. So what are you doing a little bit more about this and why I've been in this juice. I want you all to understand how captcha and recapture Works generally and what you're all doing at the cut in the back.  Answer my question was when you have images rather than words. And you have likes is this a stop sign is this a car? And the question is is that for self-driving cars? I don't know the answer to it fully. My assumption is always been that it's for that or for just general image recognition so it could be used for that but could also be I'm going to get to face recognition in a little bit other technology, but it's certainly not just being used for that one purpose anymore. It used to be so used to just be captured those images were just but now it's being used for research to and understand more, but I don't know for sure.  okay, or are and I just wanted to  got another minute.  This is my favorite number of recaptcha. The favorite thing that I like about this whole project. This is the number of distinct people that helped us at least one word out of a book The recapture 750 million, which is 10% of the world's population has helped us digitizer human knowledge and it is really big things that you might have gotten together and done with historically example of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the moon and they were all done with about the same number of people. So weird, you're all done with about a hundred thousand people. And the reason for that is because before the internet more than a hundred thousand people  So essentially impossible to get more than a hundred thousand people to work on a single project before we just saw that he has seven hundred fifty thousand people working on digitizing books as I had accident in De that you can collect on the internet you have the ability to help and solve problems are a lot bigger than we've ever been able to do previously. So I think the future is more and more of these large-scale experiments and of course, there's a lot of excitement around that but as ethics is going to see him if everything I talk about this course is also a potential for danger.  So come down and talk about self-driving cars. There are a lot of data out there and they could give you misleading claims. So this is an example of a paper that was written about Facebook data. And the title of the paper is private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior. And they know that using information on people's Facebook profiles. They can predict whether they can predict High Intelligence from things like thunderstorms The Colbert Report science and curly fries. Where is low intelligence is indicated by Sephora. I love being a mom Harley-Davidson and Lady Antebellum.  And others do stay there is no obvious connection between curly fries and high intelligence. I take all of this with a grain of salt because we're not really understanding anything intuitively about intelligence when were correlating things like this. And in fact, we might just be reinforcing stereotypes that have little to do with anything. So some of these things reliably has been allowed to put back into the how accurate this was but there's a lot of data on Facebook and it can be used for cool things interesting things or slightly silly things like thing that people who like curly fries are highly intelligent.  But that one is one of the amusing things that people try to do from these data that we have on hundreds of thousands and millions of people but I want to talk about some technologies that were like sci-fi when I was a child that are now realistic. So the first one is a short video.  I came up with the idea for a translator.  French girl  listener  Kentucky  Okay.  Damn in French.  But this is awesome. But how you doing translation technology to allow people to speak different languages, but still clearly understand each other. It's the dream know I like on Saturday. We have language barriers no longer anymore. It's real.  Okay. So this video is more marketing then showing you anything like technical that's going on here. And it's cool that two people that didn't want to communicate before can't communicate with the applications of sry Pratt. So in my own work, I generated a online course for people to learn data science with no back on another computer. I put the top of the world for free for someone English and there are a lot of people in the world who don't speak English and so we're using technology like this to translate Oliver videos translate all of our texts and to make sure this can be used by more than just ourselves and it won't be perfect translation technology is good, but it's not great. We might need to have people go in and check it after is it a large majority of the work and be done and certainly work that we wouldn't have been able to do as a team. So this type of technology is being used in education and in the government so that people from different countries can communicate so it's super cool stuff and I used to just be an idea in sci-fi.  Here's another idea of stuff that happens in has been sci-fi fiction for a while.  Working on this reflection and refraction.  Give me an answer.  80705 Ridgemont Drive  Okay. So this is been in TV shows forever that they were able to do crazy things images that weren't actually possible at the time, but now you all probably know who these two images are two very famous images. We have Abraham Lincoln on the left and the Mona Lisa on the right.  And we now have technology that can take these images and recreate what the their best guess is his but the higher res image would be so we have here on the left is a low-res image. What used to be the the our best approach Kier is now using our image technology what were able to get to and on the right is the ground truth if it were actually the high-res image you can say for most of these we get pretty darn close between what was used in the neural net and what we can what is actually the high-res image there companies that are out. There is one called a hand that I owe where you can go and put a low-res image and it will create it for you know that when you're doing that you're giving them data. So they're obviously making this a free platform so that they can increase and prove their technology, but you can go on and put a small image on and see what it comes up with on and see how close it is to what you were expecting or what you wanted and it today  This is just a cool example using the same idea. There's this photo style transfer. So this is all available on GitHub. So you can see how this works is you import an image and then you tell it what style you want to use and the output image takes the structure from the first photo and then uses the style from the second and it can be used for lots of cool pretty photos. But can also be used for images and you can create very realistic looking people that don't actually exist in real life. I'm so well, it's a cool pretty technology the fact that her that this can generate images that aren't real that look very real and it starts to become obvious when we start talking about video. So here's what happens. If the input is a video from a person and then you also input what you want that video to look like and then the output uses the emotions from the other input and the video then has the emotions of what this person had throughout the video rather than with the initial video look like in a very  Real looking way does the reserve a table like edit video but it hasn't looked really good or real and now that technology exists and it's pretty darn good and it is cool and it's really interesting technology, but you can see that there's lots of implications that could have negative effects. So what if you make a video of a politician saying something that they never actually said or try to tell somebody say that somebody committed a crime based on a video that is not actually real so manipulating reality is now more possible than ever and we need to have ways to combat this and we don't we aren't as far a hot head on how to combat it as we are on the technology.  So I think this is a short one minute video about an MIT researcher and how he handled his child in the first year of birth by putting microphones all over their house.  Zoe ball, I'm sure seeing time lapse videos where a flower blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech Forum my son soon after his first birthday. What's a Gaga to mean water and over the course the next half year. He slowly learn to proxmate the proper adult form water. So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds no video here. So you can focus on the sound Acoustics of a new kind of trajectory the water.  Journal it didn't they?  Okay, so he put microphones all over his house recorded data for over a year and then they gave it to all of his research assistants hard to analyze it and it's really cool and really at this and I story but there's risks of personal privacy here. So if you have an Alexa in your home, it's recording from you. There have been discussions about how much it's learning from you. So it's constantly collecting data and figuring out what you might want to buy high-end determining how they might Market to.  What's the ethics of recording person that doesn't know they're being recorded the ethics of recording a person who doesn't know the recording back the law differs state-to-state so it can change depending it like the legality of it determines whether or not if you're able to and in many states that you just have to one person in the conversation has to be aware that is being recorded. So like New York has that I can wear meditating Pennsylvania. You have to inform the other person. So a lot of the times when you're on calling helplines and they inform you that you are being recorded for quality control assurance that is because of the legality so the ethics of it, I think personally.  People should all be aware that they're being recorded and when they're being recorded, this is a debate in the field as a whether or not that's true exception. So if you are an investigator on a crime there are places where if you got a warrant it would warrant using the only one aware select on wiretaps and stuff like that. But I think in day-to-day life if you are being recorded you should know and so it Alexa you buy that I put it in your home and some people say, okay. Well you put in your homie turn it on its allowed to record you at any time other people say, the only time I should be able to record you is when you say hey Alexa or whatever it is, they say to do things cuz I clearly don't have one of my house. So I think and it depends who you talk to you on that question polyp.  The ethics of recording your child. So the argument in the field would be that you are the parent you're the caretaker. So you get to decide the similar argument is made in medical care. So you get to decide for them because they can't yet decide ice to end there are debating their baby has no control over the fact that his data is now being analyzed. I think he didn't have any say in it. I think their arguments on both sides of the really great question.  Similar ideas of privacy came up when these are the sorts of things and Technology take over. This was a few years ago worth you put an image in. Kate Middleton. Google will let you know what famous artwork from around the world best matches that image. So this was a 60% match to a piece called strolling along the seashore Inn. You can see that there are similarities here. And at the time there was a lot of debate in the field of like hey, what do they use in a state of a red? Like you're just giving your picture to Google when you do this to her telling you what artwork you match two, and it's using something cool to do that. But this is the way the Google to quickly get a bunch of pictures from people around the world this interesting ly was not a technology available in Illinois or Texas because they have privacy laws against this so it's there's something to do with private soon as I thought they would allow the technology to roll out into of the states.  The same idea and same question to ask when that 10-year challenge happened a few months ago where Facebook before posting a picture of them 10 years ago and her picture. Now this gives Facebook a ton of data to look at facial recognition and how things change over time. I've been amazed that Google in my Google photos can look at a baby but it was 6 months old and then three years later of my friends kids. It's able to identify. That's the same child and to me like this is only going to improve a technology. It's really cool. But also do you want to be given your data way and that is up to you to decide?  So I have a another question about which of the following ethical concerns worries. You most for the future.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so it's pretty spread across the board people are less concerned about self-driving cars and they tend to be about how and I will be used in healthcare when it comes to privacy Insurance predictability of or Automation in Warfare and intelligence and then given by a program to the machine learning with your talk about a bit a few people said none other. Does anybody have any other they want to tell me that they were thinking of?  So this trend is pretty comparable to what we see in the field. So the question was asked a little differently you could say you were concerned about more than one the most popular was the bias that our machine learning. This has been in the news. So it's assault on a lot of people's minds in the data science field and then people were also concerned about AI in intelligence and tell me about self-driving cars surprisingly to me less concerned about Automation in healthcare and how that could be used to terminate or not accurately predicted these based on the oven as we come up with.  This is another place where I wanted to point out that when your data scientist, you might not think like everybody else. So here is an interesting visualization not how I would have done it. But may I will be either good in the world's the dark is 4 bad in the world or no change as light as far as you can see that 75% of people or data scientist think it will be good. We're at the professionals think that the they think it's most likely to be bad in the world has in mind when you are pushing forward with your AI that you should probably consult people that are not like minded as you to see what they are concerned about here. I want you all to take a look at this and I want if anybody can tell me what this is trying to show cuz I've been confused by this for 2 days. This is really just you all try to tell me what this says cuz I'm confused of it up at the top the question. If you can't read it is a I more or less biased than people would a scientist turn green and ethics professionals are in grey if you want to chat with each other and then I'm like really hoping somebody can tell me why I don't understand it cuz it was clear to you. I want to hear each other. What is the showing?  What is the take-home message here?  Westbrook  32 Green Line train  All right. I've heard some confusion. Mermaids do people have interpretations. Yes.  328i engine  letter A  Okay, so maybe some gas of these numbers don't add up to a hundred. So you think maybe there's three categories less biased not biased at all. And then they just didn't show the more biased that was the closest. I got to understanding this and we have a different interpretation.  Is an artistic representation of a bias that we don't have all the data. I like that any other thoughts.  outside of their  okay, so maybe that there's not a big difference between the two and that there's not a lot of concerned. So there is there neither less biased or Not by as it also. There's not many people that are more. Is that the capture your thought more time it mess it up.  Clothes that is not a ton of concern was the name.  I so I don't know the answer. I read the report. I don't have the date of a used to generate this. I phone the words they use in the report. It seems to me like ethics professional were more concerned than data scientist. Where is worth more likely to say not by us at all. I have a feeling they just like didn't check and edit this one as well as they wanted to cuz they words and a put picture didn't really sit together. So I was mostly just I figured I'd have a few minutes where I'd have you all tell me if I'm completed because I don't really know what this green bar represents. I think this is not by Estelle and I think these are left for the question was more or less by so I'm still confused. So the last thing that I went to say was that the number of responses for people saying in which of the following scenarios would it be appropriate for a guy to make decisions without human interaction so they started it. So the things were people more people said it's fine to not have humans like select the entertainment. A lot of people are fine with Netflix.  Choosing for you what you might most likely want to say C next smle for populating social media kids are like fine with computers doing that but we are less fine with determining jail sentences hiring job candidates or determine College admittance without human being involved in the process of this is the current state of field and they'll run is each year so we can see how it changes over time. Where is some people said that none of this was okay that humans should always out have some save last few slides. You are all the future do science or doing cool things with data. So I was going to tell you what I think I would like you all to remember from this course if nothing else so probably no surprise. The first thing is that they should always be a priority in your work. I want you to consider this when your boss to tell you to do something you shouldn't do or when you are thinking about your questions whether or not you should be answering them. I also would love for you all to go for it and think of data wrangling as a puzzle rather than something that's super boring.  When you all know that there's nice is competitive but rewarding so you have a chance to make a big difference in might not be easy everywhere along the way but it's still rewarding and I wanted her to know that the greatest course is probably not predicting the future so you could have struggled in this course or not done perfectly well or not like the way I talk about data science and still going to be super super successful or you could have been really really well on sync data science is not for you and boring and all that aside and get other data points and do projects and see if you like it and hope is that you all go on to continue to be good people who are happy and successful and thanks for taking time to time.
