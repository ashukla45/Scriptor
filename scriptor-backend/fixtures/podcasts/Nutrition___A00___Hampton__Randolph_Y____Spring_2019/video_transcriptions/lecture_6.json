I just I'm still kind of reeling from that like who would steal a little eraser. This is so wrong. Okay. Anyway, we'll figure it out. I'm just going to buy like 50 of them and hide them somewhere. That's the plan. I'm not even going to tell you guys were going to hide them. Anyway, we're going to do some cool stuff today. We're talkin about fiber and glucose and I'm learning a lot and I think you'll learn a lot too. And it's it's kind of the thing about this class is this issues are pervasive. They're just everywhere and everyone has an opinion. So it's it's really going to be very interesting to experience this information. I think before that I want to talk a little bit. So I'm gone next week. I'm going to a scientific conference in beautiful Cold Spring Harbor laboratory is one of the advantages of being a student here is you get to get Top by working scientist that I'm one of them. So that's good.  The bad news is I'm away. The better news is Nigel Crawford who actually devices course is going to get giving you two of the lectures. He's a great lecturer a true expert in nutrition and you will benefit enormously and yes, the material he goes over will be on the exam or at least it'll be exam eligible now about that exam. I haven't told you much about it. It's the week after next and I don't have a slide today. But I promise you I promise just like you promised to look at those young egg study raising my right hand. I promise I will not only post detailed information about it, but I will also email all of you through the Triton wet Triton, so we will have it all together. It's going to be very straightforward exam. Not nearly as hard as the one Nigel rope.  I'm in it wasn't you who know me? I'm not about like hammering you with difficult exams. I'm about making sure we're all on the same page or the same seven or eight pages. Okay, not really. It'll be during class time.  A week from today to wait two weeks from today. Okay, so we'll figure it all out. Okay. So now we in discussion section. We are talking about an article that that discusses the Zhong egg study, right and I noticed something a student ask me a question yesterday about this article the article here that I've asked you to actually read this article here. It's 6 big print pages. They ask me a question having read one page. Did you read the article know that I looked at the first page? I totally get that you guys are inundated with this massive ocean of 2 inch deep information call the internet and you're not used to it. And I and I don't mean this in any critical way. I did not grow up with that kind of information source, so you can be like, you know, those cool birds as Roseate spoonbills.  Free by skimming the water for fish. There are the top you can do that for your whole college career, but you got to also learn and I know it's going to sound like old guy stuff, you know, like when I was a kid, we need to make our own beef. You don't like that kind of thing. It is really useful to also be able to board deep into a topic you have to learn to do that is awesome to be able to skim broad vast expanses of of information in the internet allows that in a way that didn't even exist don't even like that when I was young but we weren't sitting around waiting for the internet to be invented. You know, we were boring more deeply into stop and so you know for us it's been us people my age. We have to learn to expand into be the more the more broad analysis of things which is delightful, but you also have to learn to dig deep. So when you get a 6 page article, you have to have a little faith  Reading all six pages is a good idea. I wanted to break it up into 22 separate weeks, but it was just too much work. I thought that might help so so you have to trust me a little bit and that little article this one here, which is you're not nearly as dancers John's eggs study is actually really puts into perspective a lot of things about how this particular topic and nutrition has been dealt with over the years that something you want to know. Anyway, I like I say it's this is not for Jordan at all. It's a totally different stress on the system. I totally get why it's hard to read six or seven pages when you're used to reading small bits of stuff from all over the place. It makes perfect sense to me and I have noticed that I myself find it harder to sit for an hour and read a book than it was 20 years ago. It really is. I'm just as drawn to that brought expensive data so I can get it together. We're going to work through this and learn to dig a Little Deeper.  The airport Pickens so I decided you because we were complaining about all of this inability of find his young eggs study information about how they actually found out what I wrote. I wrote John and his his Pi this is Zhang is the first author on the paper and Allen. Nicola. Allen is be What's called the senior author that she's actually a person who funds the research and it's in her lap. So I wrote I said congratulate we can do it is going to be okay.  Congratulations on your egg study. I am teaching a large coffee UCSD full of excited undergraduates and many of tomorrow's Physician's another biomedical professionals. I go on as a mother flattering stuff. I say I'm a biochemist and Analysis Buy trade-in. So I'm not good at extracting even obvious of the expert Reader information from Hardcore large medical studies. So after trying unsuccessfully to find out this information myself code write a better paper, please I am going straight. I'm going straight to the source big you the two corresponding authors exactly was the Jada about eating habits collected. I am sorry to say I cannot tell from the primary paper or the supplement how this information was obtained and we talked about this in the discussion section. I am fairly sure that this is simply due to my lack of understanding of the terms of art that large-scale study. Pdi's use ISO. I'm taking the ignorant road, so I am worried that this  Might be a reveal of my ignorance if that is the case. So be it and if so, I apologize in advance. So I asked despite the fear of looking dull exactly. How is the information about eating and diet for the cohort members? Collect it?  Amazingly he wrote me back like an hour later that I got to get back to my hotel, but I'll fill you in cigarettes back dear Doctor Hampton. You are so welcome.  You know, I'll get through it. It takes to get the information. I don't give a shit with John things of me right though. Your question is excellent in nutrition epidemiological world. We, these food frequency questionnaire. I knew that part that they have a question to collect dietary intake for a specific time. Mostly in the previous year attached is a nephew he's actually sent me the one from the to Framingham colors in her steady ffq was developed by dr. Dre and Amigos on other commonly use dietary assessment tools include 24-hour recalls diet history and said you can easily obtain these I'm Googling each method. Please feel free to let me know if I gave you enough information. I'm happy. So what we want to know is how often were the people query where they queried each year every 5 years once okay, and if you read be on page one of the article, you will notice they complain vociferously that they  Ask everybody once what they eat and I want to know if that's true. So I wrote Vincent He's My Pal now on first-name basis. I mean Victor I wrote Victor. I know really well.  Just keep that between you and me Victor back and said how often did you use these forms or we're going to fight where to get to the bottom of the egg study, but it is actually a pretty cool thing about science that you can do that like that's pretty awesome. You know this guy and his PIR, you know, and another University who I'm just some dude from UCSD and write him a letter and within an hour you get information about us. That's pretty cool. I like that a lot. I think it's it's one of the great things about the internet. It really is pretty awesome. It's the great leveler why we have a text message General the iPads working today, so it should be possible to get some of that stuff flowing if I can just figure out how to operate this phone. OK and Anna and a Laura if you send me a whole bunch of axes are some character. I'll know that it's working. So send me something wherever you are. Where are you?  Your way up there you got signal.  Awesome. Okay, maybe it leaks through the back of the room. Okay, good. Okay. So we're we were talking about carbohydrates and we're talking about first we talked about the digestible ones in monosaccharides and disaccharides occasional trisaccharide. And then we're talking about the undigested ball actually make a terms Chorale. I never remember to photograph it but it just helps the class flow. I think it's some iata other than the text message could be the photographic Record Keeper. That would be super helpful to take a phone shot of this cuz I never ever remember to okay, so we haven't the fiber and fiber of the non-digestible non.  digestible  carbohydrates and their into category C soluble and non soluble  Now it's not surprisingly because he's our plant products and products from nature there. They can be very complex. But there's a few basic ones were talking about we're also we're talking about benefits of carbohydrates because your sister do I do the carbohydrates are all bad and we went through how is glycogen supports muscle power glycogen is needed in the liver a sufficient Supply the glucose protect us from going ketotic and using up all our protein to make the glucose we need and the last benefit was the carbohydrates that we consume provide fiber and that's what we're going. We're going to talk about fiber for here and actually pretty amazing because we can't digest it yet. It's unbelievable in for a long time. People. Fiber was just a completely unimportant non because it's non-nutritive Supply a lot of energy, you know, it's not a macronutrient at least in the traditional sent people even thought it was just unimportant. In fact a lot of processed food goes to trouble to remove the fiber from  Switch to make them more palatable easy to chew easy to consume more calories. Then the fact is it fiber is amazingly important in a lot of incredibly interesting ways. I think we're just facing the beginning of the fiber Revolution and part of that because it's so involved with the microbiome. Okay. So fiber has the number of both mechanical and biochemical features, that would be one I thought about this mechanical hydrodynamic and biochemical features. Okay. So Polymers of glucose link beta one for so we hardly any other organisms can cleave them. So they increase the bulk and soften the stool. They've been make the solid waste management flow better in the colon. The key features of fiber is fiber gets through the small intestine without doing any without getting hydrolyzer digested and so the fiber ends up in the colon or either  Has hydrodynamic and mechanical properties that are useful like I just mentioned or interesting bio chemical properties because the microbiome can digest and metabolize these things. Okay. So one of the great things about the the physical features of it is it causes left pressure for elimination of the solid waste and it turns out that actually has important clinical features. It reduces constipation, which is a comfort, you know issue but it also reduces the risk of two common aging-related gastrointestinal problems hemorrhoids and diverticulitis. Now, you've all heard of hemorrhoids with pet Preparation H. You can buy it for diverticulitis is actually a really amazing thing and I didn't know about this but I'm glad I'm teaching a class cuz people my age have to worry about this is a diverticulosis is when Pockets called diverticula form in the walls of the digestive tract. So it's really like a herniation. It's a hernia  Mission of the intestinal wall from back pressure and from overexertion and probably other features as well. So the end we got the spotlight. Let me return to the inner layer of the intestine pushes through weak spots and it actually looks like this so this is a diverticulum. I mean, that's pretty this this one looks pretty like these kind of labs, but it's pretty terrifying if I was one of the things it's amazing about the population may be partially because I'm so good. So it didn't happen in the lower part of the intestine in this is the percentage of diverticulitis. It happens in in that population. So you see that by 60 this is my age bracket here.  Is when patients come in with this problem if they're put on a diet rich in fiber that simply through those hydro hydro dynamic and mechanical process. He can really help it. So it's actually a pretty simple nutritional solution. Now that were the only function of fiber you might think that's not that interesting but there's also Bible fibers are in a number of different things some of them carbohydrates. Some of them actually not carbohydrates are various plant products, but none of them can be digested with many of them for my gel assertive a gel with water hydrogel. It actually improves a satiety makes us feel. So one of the tricks so early, not soluble non-digestible fiber.  And pectin is in apples and pears, you know in the meat of the apples and pears and pectin actually is formed this nice hydrogel into one trick people use to increase satiety meatless is Eden apple drink a glass of water right before a meal goes into the stomach. It forms a hydrogel in and occupies more space and you feel more full and fiber generally tends to make us feel more. You can see that removing the fiber from food besides make it more pliable and easy two packages things like little burgers in Patty's it also it makes it less filling and so you eat more of it. So it's you know, that's a great strategy. If your marketing food will talk more about that in the manufacturing and food supply thing. I added benefits of soluble fiber and finds glucose. O these fibers are basically like, you know, solid-state nature seems like you might use in a lab and a buying glucose. So they tend to release it more slowly as it passes through the gut.  I started a carrier a bind cholesterol and bile. So one of the things that happens with both cholesterol by the cholesterol has to be absorbed by the gut with you learn about and bio which is made from cholesterol. I told you those pictures of guy Bob Bayou there cholesterol based molecules. They are reabsorbed in the gut and so the fiber can also keep keep cholesterol from from leaving the gut as quickly as efficiently. So it's it's one way to two more limit the absorption of cholesterol. I can eggs at reduces appetite. So it's clear that fiber increases satiety in this reduces the calorie in Flex from eating and perhaps the most interest ending the most I should have colored the most interesting feature is the effects that the that the fiber have on microbiota and so the microbiome as we've learned and we talked about it again in a key is kind of cool just keeps popping up and it's cuz it's so important in nutrition in this is all very new like the last  In five years or ten years is the microbiome is very different from us that it can digest a lot of these different soluble fibers and create all sorts of products from them and it turns out those products have incredible effects on the GI tract on the immune system on the outcome of different diseases and on our general physiology and I can say are clearly this is the tip of the iceberg here. Like this is brand new kind of stuff that people are thinking about and much more will be revealed. But so some of those features we can talk about so in microbial much I've got houses trillions of microbes to eat what you eat many specialize in fermenting soluble fiber and legumes fruits grains and vegetables. The byproduct of fiber fermentation nourished cell lining of the colon. So one of the things that happens if Colin is the colon cells are specifically adapted or evolved to to use the the fermentation products of of the of the microbiome in one of them.  It's super important of these scfa. Anyone know what that stands for.  Give me at 5 second thing.  Short chain fatty acids check you get a star. Yes short chain fatty acids easier for 5345 carbon fatty acids, and it turns out that you may have remembering 102. We study the the metabolism of propionic acid is of the three carbon fatty acid. You might have just making us learn that cuz it's hard to understand but it actually propionic acid is a is massively produced by the God and have many beneficial effects. If you can metabolize it short chain fatty acids are produced along with many other things. I promise you. This isn't the only thing that the gut microbiota are making but the cool thing is that they have all kinds of important physiological facts locally on the colon and on cells that that work with the colony as well as peripheral until talk about some of that.  Trump meme I just I left this life. Like I want to add some pictures do it. I didn't miss dietary fiber is very complex. Like if you go and Google the chemistry of dietary fiber, there's tons of different structures are the winds like lignin and aren't even carbohydrate.  lignin  There's various gums. Like you've heard of gum arabic is added to a lot of things. There's beta-glucans are all sorts of different dietary fiber is in the bottom line is none of them can be metabolized by the human abased enzymes, but many of them for you to Tablo Eyes by the microbiome. Okay. So there's a number of incredibly interesting and still not obvious. Why studies that have emerged? So one of the most remarkable is that the consumption of dietary fiber seems to correlate with a lower risk for breast cancer and that is not an obvious connection. Like why would that be you know, I'm one of the powerful thing about epidemiology that can make connections that don't have mechanism yet. But it's also the perplexing thing cuz what epidemiology a large observational studies to do is create interesting and important new questions. Like what is that about? Is it real? What does it mean? How can we explain it? So this  I realize this is a good opportunity to eye to the sky. So this is the kind of day to you. See what's called a meta-analysis. So this comes from a study called that dietary fiber and breast cancer risk a systematic review and meta-analysis a perspective and prospective studies. Does anyone know what a meta-analysis is?  It's not being meditation from loving-kindness that's better, but it's different. Okay, so it's a meta-analysis.  And what it is.  Is an analysis of the analyses so that nothing means referring to sell, you know, where separate higher level and what it is is there studies that specifically take already done investigations of the same general topic and try to combine them to see what's going on at the largest populous kale. Okay, cuz what you end up having lots of separate epidemiological studies of fairly small effects, like, you know, if some if some dietary manipulation gives you a 10 or 20% increased protective effect, that's super important in terms of your Wellness in your well-being in your choices, but it's a very small effect and it's hard to tease out of his study and also is probably something is subject to a lot of variability that's hard to control observationist study. These are what people do when they want to see what's going on in a whole field of different study. So this is one of those example, so I met analysis  Time does rent in here at is a quantitative formal epidemiological study used to systematically assess previous research. That's the meta studies to derive conclusions about that body of research is the Whole Body Research Now on the connection between fiber in the diet and breast cancer. For example, something a bit different. How do you integrate that? What's the meaning of that? Okay, and so I'll come from a meta-analysis may include a more precise estimate of the effects of treatment of risk factors for disease are there are come to any other individual studies contributing to the pool of an examination of variability of heterogeneity studies results is also welcomed the benefits of meta-analyses include a Consolidated and quantitative review of a large turn off and complex. Sometimes apparently conflicting body of literature. Like you got eight studies and two of them saying there isn't an effective 6A there, isn't it back? What does that mean? How do you even start in it?  This is one approach to the snare people who make a living doing that are experts in this sort of the epidemiologic statistics in the analysis. And also a big part of meta analysis is actually doing this kind of thing. So I know there's a little hard to read but they have basically have to identify the study just involve massive literature studies. Are we going to look at and it involved screening knows that if you have time criteria, cuz if you're going to compare like 10 different studies are bunch of nice to have some criteria about what you're going to how you're going to compare them. Some things are just too much like apples and oranges for the question is what are the apples to compare and then you have eligibility. So you have to set a bunch of criteria to do this to make your comparisons in a quantitatively and scientifically useful way and then you have the analysis. So this breast cancer Med meta-analysis actually pretty amazing and I just want you to see the numbers here. We'll use the spotlight.  Perfect, and I'm fakking oil do bring the lights down on hold on. Hold on a Lot Erie yawning cuz it's Thursday. So you how you get off the hook. So okay. So check this out. They have 3723 record papers that somehow pertain to breast cancer in fiber and they have other records excluded from that. They have 2100 full text articles meaning things that are actually subject with Jada 628 articles excluded for not fulfilling their criteria to have a set of criteria. Okay, 1500 + Publications included with the right criteria, and then they have these Publications report on topics other than dietary fiber 26ft. So many of them get lost cuz they're not directly religion of fiber 26 potentially relevant Publications reporting.  Dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk, then they have nine Publications are excluded for various reasons that have to do with publication so that it was 17 Publications. It's not a whole lot. I wasn't but Seventeen Publications Eastwood studies involving thousands of people is a lot of data so you don't don't be Bamboozled by the fact they start with thousands of things just mentioned breast cancer and boil it down to 1717 studies. All of them are all prospective studies meeting people were followed it to the tune of thousands of cohort members for many years. Understand. This is a very powerful possible data set is what they did and what they found out this is kind of amazing and now she's up and look at you had some kind of a line with there's no additional changing risk. That's this by enemies of the statistics from the separate studies. And then this triangle is the combined study here and what they found was that that soluble fiber clearly  Add a benefit to people about getting breast cancer lowered. What's going to Hazard ratio. Where is insoluble fiber did not really do that. So it seems like a viable fiber is the thing at least by this very elaborate meta-analysis. So the thing that's great about that is that leads to people being able to actually do experiments to figure out what this means what's going on? Okay, so there's another and so this is now we'll go to the other end of the scientific Spectrum. So when one chance that a large-scale epidemiological advanced tools to even figure out what the state is your telling you that the meta-analysis on the other side of the spectrum are detailed highly controlled animal models and those Studies have also told us that fiber consumption despite its apparent disinterest in terms of diet is super important. So this is actually really interesting study in which they discovered the gut microbiota.  The gut microbes in my sin sin Mouse study really helping abrogating and Asthma model so asthma something is on the rise in lots of people experience it and what's involved aberrant bronchoconstriction and response to different environmental stimuli. There's allergic asthma and other kinds of asthma and so these particular researchers in night in 2014, not that long ago decided to explore using a mouse model of asthma weather dietary fiber had any effects in this cuz there had been epidemiological indications of high fiber diet help lower the incidence of asthma. So this is against this is a study that was spawned by epidemiological observational study. And so basically they gave have a model and one of the real Slim Model turn these lights to one of the readouts of the model is this red staining that has to do with the with the effects with a mucous deposit than a response to their asthma model and what they found is it  Low-fiber diets he's animals with the same pretty patient had a much bigger responses red is a bad response. This is a positive in this assay and amazingly. If you gave a high fiber diet, you got better the control so controls. Okay, low-fiber diets worth high-fiber diets better pretty amazing. So mucus in this is mucus in the lungs and I won't bore you with this. There's many pieces of data in this in this in this study, but they also showed that bronchoconstriction is affected in a number of other effects of Stoli fiber is affecting that and what they were able to discover in this is actually pretty cool. It's because you can feed these mice and analyzing very accurately. They found that feeding them up fiber, especially soluble fiber change the gut microbiome change the population of microbes in the gut. So there are millions of microbes in the gut and they break down to a number of different families or bacterial family and these families have very different.  Biochemistry, they also CrossFit each other. There's a lot of ecology only just beginning to be understood like this is going to be an incredibly important field as you grow through biomedical science, but the cool thing is they found is pretty simple idea and they also did micro micro the micro people are the microbiome people are very good at taking massive amounts of data in and making it palatable Seuss a little pie chart involving four different families of bacteria, and there are many more microbes and families in the in the gut microbiome in humans and mice what they found is that is that low-fiber diets limited the amount of this particular red bacterium and increase the amount of this particular turquoise bacterium. So this is Sydney and back to Royce after at least I'm not very good at pronouncing these and people who study the store very good at it. But what's incredibly cool about that. So this is just the two extremes. This is a low fiber diet versus a high.  Her diet and so it shows this incredible a huge effect on that on the Ecology of the got like this is a giant difference. It's like in USA Today political chart, doesn't it?  California Wyoming alterations with a composition that got we found it a diet rich in fiber increase the proportion of back to rest today a back to Roy a disc CD and notably small chain fatty acids particularly propionate. I just mentioned that and have been reported to be potent growth stimulators for bifidobacterium comparatively a low fiber diet Linda microbiota that were dominated by firmicutes. He's particularly those of the family which has also been noted in mice exposed to Western high fat diet. So they're these really interesting connections between high-fat diets that are low in fiber and changes in the microbiome. So really pretty interesting.  Macy's just paper went on to test their Mouse model by giving them only propionic acid. They said can we substitute just the fermentation product for this fancy fiber processing in the day to look pretty convincing that propionic acid produced by the microbiota at least in this animal model our involvement pretty amazing. Okay, then we go back to the biggest picture wall. Also there's the studies that really just look at mortality total gross mortality. Like this is sort of the biggest big pictures. Anyway, you can die is is computed de fiber affect that and the amazing thing is in this is another meta-analysis. You can now see the Hallmarks of a meta-analysis disease in a separate studies lying against the risk ratio and then a statistically significant degree of statistical significance and they found at 17 perspectives studies of over a million people between 1997 2014. You get a 16% drop.  In death over on 10% drop per 10 grams per day of fiber. So there's a let's go to proportionality law that the more fiber you eat in this rain the less chance you have of dying of all causes, you know, in in in in this particular study. So it seems like in probably in many ways eating fiber is good for you. So Grandma was right. So the question is how much fiber do we have to eat in this is where it gets depressing as I actually did a little calculation yesterday when I was working this lecture on my shitt. I got it. I got it up my fiber recommended daily allowance of 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men and you but the US average intake is 13 to 17 grams per day. So really pretty low. And what's amazing. This is actually an actor. This should be this is University of california-davis here. We got to fix this week. Hold on. We got to fix this.  Uh, oh something bad has happened. Okay, we got to fix this. I wouldn't want to dis my people you University of california-davis is it was actually studied there. So you CD their average and they know this cuz they have an incredibly detailed nutritionals school is just 11 grams per day. That's really low compared to recommended daily allowances. So it's something to think about is eat your fiber. I will say this and Nigel actually told me I said it was that a misprint is it was the UCSD course now, it's UC Davis. He did a sabbatical there cuz they have one of the best nutrition science departments in the country. So if you're interested in this kind of thing UC Davis is an awesome place to go for vet school tuition incredible vet school, but they have a lot of very good sort of interpretive science going on the outside of an amazing oenology Department that's winemaking and they doing deep science on wine making  Used to Know mix so probably a pretty awesome party school nutrition fiber is whole plant-based Foods vegetables beans nuts whole grain so kind of things that we tend to shun unless we go to those hippie coops right brown rice whole anything about the fiber is you have to be sort of you have to do many many different kinds of foods to get enough of it unless you just eat some massive supplement of it. And so here's a nice example in this depresses me cuz I really love white rice and I really hate brown rice. But but I guess I have to change. This is a beautiful example of simple food choices affecting you this is comparing 8, oz of cooked long-grain rice dances of cooked brown rice and really what white rice is brown rice at where the husk of the grainy fibrous husk has been taken off to make it soft and palatable and fun to eat it.  Honda right. So but and you'll notice a measuring is there almost identical calorically very similar protein content similar carbs or fat and five times as much fiber. So really eating rice 8 oz in tears right about that big is not a lot really a good idea. Here is a good news. I have good news popcorn popcorn is actually a fantastic source of fiber don't go to the movies and popcorn cuz it's full of fat and salt air popped popcorn corn is only 93 calories, which is very few right very few and a latte is 120 just without sugar in or just some the milk. So, you know, I'm kind of put it in perspective here. So that's 3.5 grams of fiber. So I knew popcorn was awesome. And now I know why it's not. Okay. Let's do a little quick. It's been awhile.  It's been awhile.  We've missed it.  All right ready?  day trading  rating  raffinose is a trisaccharide a disaccharide or monosaccharide a complex carbohydrate. I want to see if there's been any absorption.  Or let's get you his hurried up flickers.  Turn it up.  All right.  Many of you know this yes, this is a trisaccharide is problematic because it has that Alpha galactose bond that cannot be hydrolyzed in the gut just like a TV version of a soluble fiber guess it all gaseous Hell Breaks Loose. Okay, that's really cool that you know that I'm glad  glucose is absorbed in the gut by the action of a glute transporter by the action of the sglt1 transporter by the action of both by the action of insulin regulated for which is it  best answer  there's a little bit study hall.  All right, let's go.  stop  I need to look at that even progression.  This is the power of guesswork know it is a see it's the action of both and we started describe this that the the the ape the basic the apical surface has the sodium co-transporter has glucose is low. So I didn't I so you take advantage of that great and then the glute to Transporters on the other side, so they work together. Okay. Well, let's do another A variation  A weight glucose is absorbed into muscle.  By the action, it's the same set of questions by the action that one actually or D. Which is it.  All right. I'm going to stop here so I can great stuff to talk about.  All right, stop.  You are well-trained. This is true. It is the good for transported is regulated by insulin is the primary source of resting muscle. Now, if you took VIP and 108, you will know that there's a whole other route of glucose entry in exercising muscle that is very interesting and separate from this but we're not going into that. It is actually really important aspect of exercise mediated benefit, but we can talk about that when the gut produces excess ketones when liver acetylcholine levels are elevated when blood glucose levels are high is one of those ones in a fully explanatory answer but it's the best dancer, okay.  I want to talk more about ketosis.  Okay.  Somebody in the last texting app would it be no were in a suppository form? I thought that was an awesome idea. I think you would get propulsion.  ketosis  Ready?  Do you more?  Can you stop?  All right.  Sweet. Okay, many of you know that ketosis one of the aspects of you just as critical as a c Toco a levels are elevated quite high in the liver cuz the liver is struggling to make glucose.  Krebs cycle activities low because those molecules are being shunted for glucose synthesis fatty acids in the meantime or powering the process. So is helical a builds up. It ain't got nowhere to go. It combines to make these Ketone bodies to help the low glucose problem. It's a beautiful biochemical adaptation. We'll talk more about this later. Okay, so stinky glucose. I want to start a few questions here we can deal with them. Here's one is how can food frequency surveys be reliable. If most people can't quantify how much vegetables they ate in a week measured in cups. This is the critical question and one of the hardest things about nutritional studies, especially observational studies and epidemiological studies is the self-reporting of food is notoriously difficult to get right.  And you can try it yourself. It is very hard to know how much you're eating accurately. It's very tough is Metamucil safe and actually good source of dietary fiber. I've heard that I don't really know. I'm going to look into it. How would you know if the eggs are the primary source of cholesterol if they could be eating a lot of other high cholesterol foods. This is one of those two reporting things. So when you do these analyses a big part of epidemiological studies is figuring out surveys that are going to help teeth out that information figuring out how to do that. You know, it's really challenging.  In a meta-analysis can they combine studies with using different city designs or are they all the same thing on this is that that's a beautiful quite all questions. You're beautiful. But that is the challenge in a meta-analysis as you want to get as much data together as possible, but it has to be comparable in terms of study design and so does burial everything's alright over 35,000 publication to go down to 17 is funeral by applying the criteria to see what is a what is a comparable you knowing that you and I'm not an expert in this is one of the real challenges of doing that Ms. Is how do you get the biggest bread but the best you know comparability. So those are the two things working against each other. Let's see if this is good my aunt who practices traditional Chinese medicine heavily emphasized the role of eliminating enough. What's the Western perspective on the number of times elimination is needed per day. I'm busy once  One giant one. Who knows? I don't know but don't bring the newspaper in there. That's just trouble or your iPad or whatever. That's just trouble it. What is considered a complex carbohydrate carbohydrate that is polymerized that is you know, many many monomers are then there are usually have to be broken down and then there's not digestible ones like cellulose and other things like that and digestible ones like start all good, but they're usually better than someone to review blood glucose regulation and we're going to talk about glycemic index glycemic load diabetes and that kind of thing. So, you know, this is a very Salient set of topics for for any of tomorrow's biomedical scientist send one of the things we never said management of glucose is a huge challenge of people get older eat poorly don't exercise.  Anda and consumed by low fiber highly manufactured food. So this is yet another a picture of how blood glucose is regulated and one way to view it is when blood glucose is elevated the pancreas release insulin. So the pancreas has two lies and pancreas has this life of of releasing bicarbonate and other materials to help digestion, but the pancreas and a bunch of enzymes and proteolytic enzymes but it also has this life of the smaller islet of langerhans cells to produce these potent and contradictory hormones insulin and glucagon at work sort of opposite of each other and so insulin, you know is is the hormone is produced when glucose is abundant when we just had a meal and is involved in storing glucose away getting it taken up by the tissue made into glycogen in both muscle and liver to store and also uptake  And storage of fatso insulin is like they say the hormonal plenty and then the other side gets low and glucose is gone and glucagon that's used to remember it when glucose is going you get glucose going and the pancreas releases glucagon from a separate set of cells called alpha cells and that involves the breakdown of glycogen to produce more glucose any Kris synthesis of God says glucose is gone. We got to make more we got to release more insolence as glucose is coming in. So I just made that up and so you have to store it in always rainy day is here rainy day is coming and really one way to view our physiologies. We're just in a constant state of feasting or famine, you know, we and one of the great things about these hormonal and storage systems if you can eat a meal and then do other stuff for 8 or 10 or 6 or 7 or you know five hours this is really an awesome feature of being an organism that can do this cuz you can  Culture write a poem go to a class write a bird whatever you want to do instead of just foraging for food. So that's pretty awesome. So insulin and glucagon they respond literally by blood levels going up and down. So this is actually before and after a meal. So this is this line here is when a meal occurs your blood glucose Rises very quickly within minutes. This is 60 minutes here and what happens if insulin goes up and glucagon, so it's going down and another feature. That's it. We're not really talked about his insulin regulates glucagon released. So the alpha cells have insulin receptors that sense influence Darwin influence. Hi Google guns turn down and they work exerted against each other in this very valuable waitress a push-pull kind of mechanism here and turn glucagon go down. You see this mean he's dead or just physiological measurement but as blood glucose charts going down eventually glucagon goes up. This is after a long fast here and blue Coast.  Here are pretty low enough around here. So you get this constant oscillation of glucose. And so the interesting thing about sort of human physiology off easier cuz all animals do this all glucose. I think insulin the lowest organism is the simplest organisms that is called a sea. Tulip Searcy to him is basically like meat on a stick. It looks almost like a plan but it's in very very primitive animal and you can find insulin immunoreactivity in those things what it's doing there in like hormones in almost all his own vomit is Owen. So it's a very common regulatory axes. But what's amazing is it that you were kept in a pretty tiring? So hyperglycemia is defined as above 125 milligrams per deciliter and milligrams per deciliter. Is this really common term but it's a weird me the number of milligrams in 100 ml of plasma or blood so, I mean, it's  I don't know why they came up with that but it's been in the literature for so long that it's a familiar term and if you buy a glucose monitor a default state is milligrams per deciliter. You can switch them to Millen millimolar if you want to I bet it's like three or four for $5000000 the same thing so hyperglycemia urination kidneys filter out glucose and released into the urine which causes dehydration and put the chronic condition. So the acute condition of hyperglycemia is not a big problem. You can eat a huge meal in your blood sugar will go up briefly Spike and come back down and that's not a problem. But the chronic condition of hyperglycemia is really, you know, you have vascular problems eye problems all sorts of difficulties it have to do with elevated chronically elevated glucose in the truth is that it isn't totally obvious. Why high glucose is many interesting models about how high glucose affects all of these different tissues and it's a hole  Glucose pathology. It's it's really it's pretty complex and probably multifactorial hypoglycemia. If you have hypoglycemia to the tune of below 50 milligrams per deciliter, you will definitely feel that you know, that thing about being hangry when you're hungry and angry a lot of that is the way hypoglycemia feel and if you are ignorant nervous irritable headache brand is losing to I don't exactly know if that's why a headache is cause I think that's Nigel being imaginative cuz I grabbed it from the slide, cuz I think headaches more about basket of cheer than actually your brain not being nourished. Anyway acute condition can be lethal. So this is the interesting thing about hypoglycemia is it is acutely problematic hyperglycemia chronically problematic. So they're just very different parts of the same Spectrum in this is this is simply review. This is you know, insulin and glucagon with this is actually from an earlier Slide the insulin increases glucose uptake  Chris is glycogen synthesis industriplex blood glucose. So when you have hyperglycemia blue, you get the blue hormone doing his thing when you have hypoglycemia red you get the red hormone doing its thing. This is I'm hoping his review why glucagon goes up just before eating food. I think that's just a physiological date. I don't think that's a real thing. Okay. Can you ever consume too much fiber? Yes. Apparently there's I looked into this. There are Mayo Clinic designed low-fiber diets for people who have trouble with a too much impact in so this is probably sweet spot of fiber, but we're okay. So that's best used in terms of connecting nutrition to glucose is called the glycemic index and you probably heard of the glycemic if people talk at nothing about the glycemic index of food and basically what it is, it's a measure of how quickly glucose monomers are released into the blood.  Stream up upon eating a food so different foods tend to release glucose. So if you have a complex starts with a lot of branches, it will be different from a simple starts with the be different from straight glucose, whatever so people want to go decided on a way to compare the tendency to raise blood glucose for a food with glucose. So it's basically a normalized i normalize measure of glucose production in the blood. So this is like a typical measures you did here was spotlighted you feed 8 to 10 volunteers basket overnight. What is going on over there? Someone's getting hurt in 50 grams of equivalence of carbs monitor changes in blood glucose for 2 to 3 hours. This is average over time when people do the standard glucose for the test and and 4 test food then take the ratio in * 100 in EU you take  Blood glucose you getting a certain. Of time with the food you compared to the amount of blood glucose is released by actual glucose and you normalize that you can already tell from this that glucose is going to have a gimmick index of wine because it will be glucose vs. Glucose. So this is the fancy turn. The ratio is glycemic index is the change in blood glucose cause by the test / the change of blood glucose cause high glucose itself 10200. So it's a percentage so it's a percentage. Okay, and this is an indication of how quickly food various would cause blood glucose to go up in India in after consumption and so less than 55 or low 55 and 70s intermediate and above 70 is high. Okay, so I'm about 70 is meeting you get a plastic move in and you need fuel.  Of your biking up a mountain on a trail and you are you know, you are running out of fuel high glycemic index is fantastic. You know, it depends what you need to renew your you know, what I'm missing and you need your energy because you just spotted enemy activity, you know, you don't want something is going to deliver glucose over the next 3 hours you need something now. So it all depends on the other hand. If you're eating lots of high glycemic index foods and you spike blood glucose really high a lot. That's you know overtime not a good thing. So it just depends right but it's been to be not surprisingly glycemic index has been measured extensively for many boozers huge charts of glycemic index partially because one of the strategies in managing diabetes is controlling diet and glycemic index is a very reasonable thing to be thinking about four people have trouble controlling the height of their blood sugar. So this makes a lot of sense. So this is just a little example of this.  All the fun of high stature. I didn't grow as big as my brother's cuz I hated eating everything but it's okay, I exercise and they don't they look like pears.  So anyway, I love them both.  So here's like brown rice white rice spaghetti. And what's interesting is that younger races have pretty this is a glycemic index really turn the spotlight off is driving. All of us crazy. White short grain rice is much higher than these brown rice or long. Grain rice is good to know. So short grain rice. My favourite has the highest and then there's his term glycemic load, which I'll tell you in a minute. It's related vegetables have pretty low. Although potatoes. I can potatoes are basically starch in potatoes are awesomely delicious start and they are very quick to release glucose. This is why fries are awesome when you're tired. Okay, then this Dairy Foods dairy foods are pretty low. You know, they don't have a lot of carbs in the carbs are really slowly and then there's legumes.  And they have pretty low glycemic index and they have low amounts of carbs to see you. See this term here glycemic load like what is glycemic load and that basically is a practical measure when you take the glycemic index and bundle it with the amount of glucose involved. If you have a food that has a high glycemic index but not a lot of carbs per gram. It won't cause a big perturbation of glucose. If you have a food that has a low glycemic index but a ton of cards for granite will have more of an effect than you might expect. So the load combines Jesus of the glycemic loads are pretty valuable turn to buy Scenic load is just the glycemic index X the grams of carbs in a typical portion size meaning it's telling you you know, what it is bundling the amount of carbs present with the rate at which their release so is a useful tool for a food actual tendency to raise blood glucose and both of them are considered. They're both useful. Okay, so that's the  Missy we got here.  There's something about fasting and autophagy very fancy, but we're not going to talk about it here. You must be listen to Peter attia could hypoglycemia directly caused an increase desire for sugar and sugar definitely causes a desire to to self to self note to self nutrients to self-consumed need to consume. And if you are hypoglycemic, you will feel a strong tendency to eat. And now the question is whether that is innate sense or because of you know, the thousands of times you've eaten when you're hungry, you know, what is is palatable? That's an interesting question. You know, I think there probably is a combination of the two so high glycemic load promise there are problems with high glycemic load his number when you get a more rapid return to hunger and that's because high glycemic loads cause a spike of insulin they say which causes a wrap it up taking it and and hunger after that so somebody's been asked me about you know after you are going  A carb, you end up hungry because you have spiked your glucose in your you've activated a lot of insulin at supposed to gradually producing insulin to this one possibility. You have an increased risk for I think that's CV to cardiovascular disease are particularly for women. It seems like high glycemic load. Nothing else has an even bigger effect on women and men in terms of risk for cardiovascular disease in this is epidemiologic reasons behind that aren't so obvious yet and then a increase risk of insulin in sensitivity and diet long-term consumption of high glycemic load food seems to cause a propensity to develop type 2 diabetes which leads us to the next topic. Okay. I want to talk a little about insulin and diabetes large and interesting and important.  Field I guess you could call it and it's definitely a field you're going to run up against if you're one of tomorrow's health professionals because of the massive number of diabetes cases that are arising. It's also something that you just will think about if you have loved ones who are growing older and especially loved ones are growing older who don't eat that well and don't exercise because it's definitely correlated Sophie's the initial observation came straight from animal physiologies. If you remove the pancreas of a dog is dogs have a very similar glucose regulation and cardiovascular features to humans as hard is it to imagine using dog as an experimental errors of his dogs are so awesome. It's still you know, they're really great research animals and so in the late 1800s people found the simple observation, if you remove the pancreas of a dog day completely lose glucose control to get super hyperglycemic. They produce a lot of urine because of that hyperglycemia. They have a wasting disease and they don't live very long.  If you take the pancreas and put it under the skin of the dog, so it's still looks alive. They don't get those symptoms meaning it probably is releasing something so you probably all I've heard of Banting and Best these two people here to Toronto who discovered insulin and everybody knew that the pancreas is producing insulin or something that control blood glucose, but no one knew how to get their hands on it and be thinking was so Banting. This is actually a great series Banting with a a researcher who came to McLeod's apartment in best was a medical student. He was a first-year medical student. He lives in the annals of scientific and biochemical history and he was a med student needed a summer project at so he just latched onto Banting at by any interest in years is between 2 guys named best and Noble and Noble lost out in best one in became famous for forever in the annals of of biochemistry, but standing in best went to Professor McLeod's lab who's ahead  A big department and Physiology at Toronto and what they said if they said, you know, the pancreas releases all these proteolytic enzymes like we've learned about so maybe if there's a way to get the pancreas to stop making those nasty enzymes may be that those other things are hurting this factor in Bucyrus. They didn't know anything about it. So they figure out a way to tie off the pancreas to make dye off except for the longer on cells and able to extract a fact that when you injected into these pancreatic to my eyes dogs, you got glucose control back and that's a cool story, but it is such a more elaborate store in that so I know you don't hang this old guy still he got to dig deep can spread out of it. But this book this is a book that is absolutely amazing. I like a couple months ago. I read the whole thing, even though I am to completely drawn into the shallow broad information Matrix of the internet. I'm a victim of that too, but this book called The Discovery Bay  If I buy a guy Michael Bliss is just absolutely fantastic. It's really interesting. Anything about is Banting with a complete nut. Like he was a crazy paranoid about credit. He hated McLeod who is his Department's York. Ski always thought I was trying to steal credit from him and and undermine his work and it's just it's elaborately dramatic story. It all ended up for the best because everybody wanted to give diabetic children insulin. So maybe they're sort of a beautiful impetus with a constant turn of crazy drama all the time that the end when they got their Nobel Prize Banting and they wouldn't even speak to each other. Like I said, he didn't know anything about biomedical science and he went through all the lab notebooks and figured out what really happened. It's just he also goes to the history of the whole because everybody knew the pancreas.  People try to do with banding invested and some people probably even succeeded and a few of them even published before bending it. So it's very complicated story really is beautifully written. I know you got enough to read got the eggs study. Leave me alone. I want to read a book but this book if you're going to be a physician, this is a really cool book to read one of the things you will learn from this book right away. Is it is it diabetes? This is a terrible disease before in toes invented. So basically would happens and diabetics who have poor or no control of glucose insulin is when they eat a meal their blood glucose spikes and just stays really high and this is actually pretty mod Madison an untreated diabetic the blood glucose can go up incredibly high and they also need truly untreated diabetic. There's more problems. This is sort of a a picture of blood glucose after meal for what's go reactive hypoglycemia where I can talk about normal people diabetics and kind.  I saw this what is diabetes. Once you know, it's a syndrome that involve poor response to insulin. That's really what diabetes is. So this type 1 diabetes which accounts are between 5 and 10% of cases and it's usually juvenile-onset. Although that is really interesting new cases of adult onset type 1 diabetes. I'm weirdly. I know three different people who have this. I think it's a science cluster. I'm not sure but most of the time is juvenile onset and what it is is a complete loss of the beta cells due to autoimmune attack. So this is an autoimmune illness or reasons and still are not cleared is definitely genetic propensity for it tends to sometimes run in families, but not in the way that you have is no single Gene is involved. It involves an elaborate array of autoimmune attacks it once they get going there's no way to stop it and basically people who have type 1 diabetes, they lose their beta cells in a very specifically loser baby. So I was there glucagon producing cells are still there.  And they develop a symptomatology where although there's a bandhan glucose the body thinks there's no glucose. The liver is completely unaware is because the only way to liver cells know there's glucose is by insulin telling and so you basically get a state of extreme starvation, even though there's plenty of material to take up. So the treatment is insulin injections and assertive. There's an irony about this did highlights the difference between hypoglycemia hyper is offering diabetics can suffer greatly and even die from over injecting insulin by accident and getting hypoglycemic shock which can be like I know a friend of mine is a scientist in in College Station, Texas and he's been a type 1 diabetic and I've seen him before talk and I cannot be able to get up and he needs like a cousin orange juice because he's gone hypoglycemic from injecting his insulin and literally Mason is 5 minutes later. He's up giving his talk. It's like incredibly fast the effects of hypoglycemia in reverse.  This is something that we don't hear much of insulin for all its problems has completely changed the face of diabetes in the 1990s before people who had type 1 diabetes. We're on the road to death. They were going to die. It was sort of like age in the 1980s. It was a death sentence and that's changed also and so this is this is an incredible turn one of the great things about the discovery in phone book is it talks about the very first patients who came into Toronto and were cured literally or alleviated. This is a particular patient who's actually featured in that book and this is her before treatment. I think she was in 9 year old girl and 4 months. I dislike looks like someone who's basically going to start it. It says someone is well-fed is starving to death with their body can't use any of the nutrients that are available and this is the same person after 4 months is just you know, and end this particular individual lived into adulthood and was a very vociferous a fan.  Banting and helped him get credit for you know, I mean these dramatic cases the problem with the discovery insulin as soon as it was realized everybody on the planet wanted it because there's lots of diabetics. There's a holster geopolitical corporate aspect of the insulin Discovery discovered in his book 2. So you can type 2 diabetes always the more abundant kind is the more is the man it's not like type one isn't important. It's incredibly important us and it's still like thousands and thousands of people have it but type 2 diabetes and I don't mean that in any penny weigh the majority of cases are type 2 diabetes. So something like 80% of them are associated with obesity and what this is instead of losing its unfortunately called non-insulin if non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, that's what niddm stands for niddm which is sort of a  Summer because it means it's not depend on insulin missing and it's actually insulin treatment is used for type 2 diabetics also, so it's not a great name. Non-insulin dependent diabetes is not missing. There's no attack on the beta cells. Okay. So what happens is it to do to a collection of prophecies some genetic propensity definitely some lifestyle choices a mix of things cause a decrease in sensitivity to insulin and that increasing sensitivity insulin causes a number of difficult a pathological problems that are related to the type 1 diabetes, but not exactly identical. So you get and the treatment in this case is medication including insulin for type 2 diabetics take insulin also in order to improve their glucose update because they're they're not insensitive to it are resistant to insulin. They have a lower sensitivity and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise the overview diabetes if you add up all the  Hey sis, it's about 10% of the US population. That's fine. I had to said 14% but I think it's gone down to 10% which is a good thing but that's still a crap load of people. You know, that's 40 million people with type with diabetes has six leading cause of death but beyond that is also a cause an enormous to pathology that aren't lethal. So at least the leading cause of blindness cuz their eye problems of kidney failure of amputation and one of the questions is to what extent is it due to poor uptake of glucose vs. Pore removal of glucose from the blood and its path its toxicity in the missus ongoing you also can get cases of ketosis. So one of the most extreme ways to see ketosis used to have poor uptake or poor sensing of insulin percentage of glucose in the liver. The liver thinks then that there's no glucose. It starts making gluconeogenesis been doing ketosis sew a tie.  When diabetic has been treated as overt ketosis because it started the extreme case of a beliver thinking there's absolutely no a glucose around so like that. So this is basically the profile of a of a of a diet of low and high glycemic index food. So one of the obvious things is if someone has Type 2 diabetes and struggling to keep their blood glucose or type one even it's a reasonable thing to look for its low glycemic load low glycemic index foods. And basically when you eat a high glycemic index food, you get a blast of glucose above the desirable range and then you integrate that over thousands of meals over 20 or 30 years, you know, you you're old you're often in this not so sweet spot and low glycemic index foods keep this peak lower. I mean, it's a pretty simple idea and this is something that can easily be dialed in and where is there's incredibly tragic examples of dietary.  Is a type 1 diabetes it really basically only starve before children more. So I'll because trying to lower the blood glucose type 2 diabetes diet is a very reasonable part of a management of this illness. So you're one of the most important things is involved in this current diabetes and obesity epidemic and you can see their interconnected 80% of type 2 diabetics are obese. There's clearly a propensity to become type 2 diabetic with obesity and that's probably how does obesity promotes insulin insensitivity and sensitivity Alters lipid metabolism in the feedback on each other in ways that are being worked out but one of the most important nutritional changes in this is massive is the amount of sugar that each of us. Okay. So this is a little chart of going from 1820 to 2013 is the amount of sugar people 8 per person in the United States and it went from 7 lb  50 lb to a hundred pounds it is easy to find someone who eats a hundred pounds of table sugar a year and it's even more so in the 1600s the average person ate something like 5 lb and of course that map to people who are wealthy the wealthy people got the sugar there's a whole other separate incredible socio-cultural aspect of the of the way sugar came to be such a huge product and its really we don't have time to talk about it, but it involves geopolitics and slavery and oppression and it's incredibly this ride from 1820 up here involves in a labret a collection of corporate process is both good and bad that have added up to doing this has been amazing story. Thank you teacher whole class in sugar. Okay, but what's interesting and important for us and for you tomorrow biomedical scientist is even from 9 from 1978 total.  Powdered sugar consumption is continue to climb upwards. Okay and Carter, that's because even though sucrose can something slower. It's because there's new forms of sugar including high fructose corn syrup, which I already hear high fructose corn syrup, which is actually a product made from start made from cornstarch. You can get cornstarch as them days. It will be abundant product. It is everywhere. There's a huge going into 3 + in about 1960 a laboratory figured out how to take that cornstarch and converted into equal parts glucose and fructose are about fifty-fifty descendants 40/60 and 1964. He doesn't really matter. It's basically identical nutritionally to sucrose the table sugar, but the thing about how is corn syrup and high fructose compared to having all glucose. It's about fifty-fifty. It's not like I'm an overdose of Bruto since the same as heating table sugar butt.  High fructose corn syrup is cheap that can be shipped in big tank trucks that can be made without plants having to make sucrose and you can put it in everything. It is amazing how many food products have high fructose corn syrup? And if you take next time you eat something that has a label on a barcode. You will see almost all cuz it's delicious. I'm a huge fan but is problematic. Okay. So this is actually a description of the high fructose corn syrup and consumption. So this is different countries consume. I think this is about eight seven or eight years ago. But the USA is the is the make America sweet again. So USA is is really the magazine reported. That's because the Industrial Pipeline is is very active in the United States. Also, we love our delicious foods. Okay. So where is all this sugar coming from in our diets? Where is this?  Hundred pounds coming from and the fact is at least right now and maybe this is changing. Maybe there's a changing although a lot of people like this is the massive amount of sugar is coming. The average diet is soft drinks like soft drinks are a phenomenal and remember we talked about they are not only are they incredibly Rich energetically. They have almost no nutrient value. So they have a terrible nutrient ratio, but a fantastic energy ratio sugar is in candy go into any CVS and it's like a universe of candy facing you when you go to the cash register cookies and pies all these things stomach Mary Poppins cakes cookies and don't be fooled you go to Jamba Juice that's a huge amount of sugar in one of those healthy beverages. I love them. They're delicious, but don't be fooled, you know Dairy dessert places, but it's mostly these highly commercialized sugar sources so added sugar as has  Ricardo Vasquez I have one minute left. Let me see. I was going to talk about artificial sweeteners to but let me just say that cardiovascular disease risk is elevated by increase sugar content. This is clear from meta-analyses. There's a definitely a relationship between high sugar consumption and risk for diabetes with the pancreas is working too hard. No one's quite sure but it is so what to do about it what to do about it artificial sweeteners, you know the drill you probably all use them. There's sugar alcohols that arenot can be metabolized or sweet, but they don't cause tooth decay. They have some caloric value and then these non-nutritive ones that are phenomenally sweet. This is a chart you can get on the down-low, but when I want you to know is even this is probably not a solution because we now know that they're these weird connections between artificial sweeteners and problems in both animal studies and epidemiological. So I'll end with this is all  No, artificial sweeteners are developed data and data and both animal and human suggest the effects of Artemis. May contribute to metabolic syndrome and obesity epidemic, although sweeteners appear to change a host microbiome lead to decreased satiety and Alder glucose homeostasis and are associated with increased. I will see you the week after this one. "
