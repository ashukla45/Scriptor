I can already tell this is going to be an incredibly interesting class because I am learning so much from it and it's just that it's a beautiful thing to understand the science behind something. We do seventy thousand times in our lifetime. So I'm pretty stoked about that. Let's see a couple things were involved in the Bold experiment text question and we did have as of today a text Master General meeting the person who was going to integrate the signals and then send them to me in a more time order the single user version, but I forgot my phone it's in my office and I was halfway here and did not want to be even later than I normally am. So a SIM card failure. What the hell  The hell is that maybe we're not going to get anything out of this anyways.  Okay, that's crazy. Well, anyway, we'll figure it out as often these difficulties. Let's see.  I got a phone to give you Randy cellular data failure to find cellular Plans available in your area. What?  Search again. Say what?  Or UCSD protected. We'll see what happens. It may be a moot issue. Anyway, okay, so  Get rid of that.  It's just a general failure of signal here.  Okay. Well, we'll see if that works. If it doesn't it doesn't normally it works. I don't know why someone gave me a flower very nice.  No one Tritton said they'd lectures are posted. I actually posted today's lectures, but it was about 45 minutes ago. So you could right now down if you can get Wi-Fi all power to you if you could if you have Wi-Fi.  No, some no said. Yes, I see yesterday. I know you do and you don't what better antenna. I don't know. What is a gas. They're protected protected. Whatever. I mean that's where you're sitting next to each other one has been doesn't electromagnetic waves. Go figure. Anyway are there they are available for the smart money is to grab the lectures a few minutes before a class if you want them coming in. How is the Triton 5K? Will you move your office hours ride? That's interesting.  Deirdre fashion in spray from Steve Jobs in the same time. I don't want to make any decisions. I don't have to so invite. My spouse is a banker and just a dress to the nines cuz people don't give people look like me a couple million bucks to secure it. You know, they give people that look good, but I just have a stack of black t-shirts and is to yes. Yes. No anyway so that if we've got that now also and Triton that we have our terms listen to study this is growing. So the end of the week, I I update them. So they are, you know, they're basically the terms and the Future 2 Concepts you need to know and as I said all the classes we had if you know the terms and the things in the state of this you can't not do bad that's a double negative you will do well and I got even devised the exams from the terms of the study list so that we're all on the same page. So it's you know, and as I've said,  These classes are to a large extent language classes. You're learning to speak a language. That's part of a field. So it makes sense to have it in here. We have the term Corral. I'll say this lecture today has a lot of term for not going to try to write everything down, but they will all be on the terms list, you know, this is useful for things that aren't on the slides that pop up that I want you to know and one of these years I'm going to remember to photograph these terms with us after I leave class. So I ate we seem to just now I seem to not be able to do that. I don't know why. Okay. Let's see. I want to say one thing. This is my stand corrected. So this is I'm going to stay in self-corrected is I try to be funny. I'm sort of a humorous person. I think it's important to add a little bit of that the class but I made jokes about a term called triggers now, I understand. This has a lot of different import and I want to explain something. I am an addict in recovery. I have 36 years clean and sober. I'm very happy about that. It's a very important  My life is before any of you were a good idea. All the trouble happened now, it's gone. But I still meeting I understand the term trigger into in that world. It's a very important part of recovery and addiction and many other things. So when I can about it, I'm just trying to take the power out of a term that is important, but I don't want to dominate. However, I understand the different people have different ways of processing that term and I'm not trying to belittle or make anyone uncomfortable things that make them uncomfortable. So forgive me if I made that joke and it made you fit if it triggered you forgive me weird backflow in that but but really I wasn't trying to make anyone on the last thing I want to do. Okay respect.  Okay, so I stand self-corrected. So we were talking a bit about nutrients and things in food. And and we had talked about this elaborate set of GRA State daily recommended intakes and there's ones that are that limit how much they wanted to find how much how little you should get & Beyond there's averages and then ones that you know, when does a whole collection of 1/3 of an acronym hell and the trouble with those are their highly defined they're done by this national food board that is in a group of scientist are based on gender based on Age based on different aspects of a of an individual's time through life and and they're not that useful as general tool. Cuz one of the things that is a sort of a challenging nutritionist figure out one thing you can say to everyone it's generally useful now there's sometimes you just can't do that, you know, an athlete needs different fuel in different amounts of energies and someone who doesn't know people of different medical needs hyped.  Diets, so, of course there's a there's times you have to be very specific but one of the things that that is useful as other way to just recommend to everyone what they can eat. So there's this idea of daily values that is put together. The generic standards are developed by the US Food and Drug Administration because Dr. Aziz daily recommended intakes are aged gender-specific. There are various Inc in the daily values are much more pragmatic and that's what you see on these food label. So this is one of those great paradoxical wonderful things about our food supply. So it is incredibly great that anything you buy in the supermarket you can get a pretty accurate description of what's in it and especially amusing is the the stuff down here the X in Crazy list of ingredients many of which are friends weren't scientist will ask you what they all are one by one and you'll go food science.  Chemicals, but the fact is that these are all daily values. And so what these are our integrated from a lot of different science a lot of different studies and research when it's possible or estimates when that's all that's available to give one number that's pretty good for a estimate on how much you're getting of all these things about this stuff is so if you want to just some extent avoid no one goes to these letters. Okay. I'm getting enough vitamin D here. They go and say I'm eating way too many of these calories oshit. That's a lot of sugar, you know, so just that these lists are useful because they often telling us that we don't want to get too much like I'm starting to get obsessed with salt because I'm older and people in my age bracket. So I have to start thinking about salt star nursing. How much salt is in the manufacturing food diet. It's incredible and I can tell you a simple way if you weigh yourself every morning, you will notice it after you go to a restaurant you will worry about it.  Half a pound more or more than you think you're going to because you're retaining so much water from the delicious salt salt makes things taste good and it's one of the things that manufacturing restaurant foods are very very Avid about putting in and you can even watching people are cooking on a shorter to go. They have one of those big canvases the song. They just got like this like it's like a snowstorm, you know, when you cook at home, this is something I I now know that I have a more domestic life and I know he constantly manufacture food. So then why are incredibly useful it's good to have a weariness, but if there's a label on it, that means it's processed in manufacturing food. No one has figured out how to grow a barcode onto a pepper yet. So so the downside it's a double-edged think it's great to have this awareness, you know, when there's a lot of details to go over including even little tables of the actual daily values for things. You know that are a pretty pretty  Pretty elaborate but it means it's manufacturing process food. And that's probably as will learn later in this class something that is worth avoiding or worth at least being cognizant. That one is consuming. It all kinds of things are manufactured food that are there to make the food supply chain work better commercially, like it stayed last longer. It's easier to you know, it's more appealing but it isn't necessarily always so good for you at last long time as a very long shelf-life amazing studies where they found Hostess Twinkies from 20 years ago that are just fine and they're fine. So, you know, there's a there's a huge fan of Hostess Twinkies. Don't get me wrong. I think the greatest food ever made but you know, that's cuz I'm a child of the 50s, right? So I'm so what are the things that that is is worth at least thinking about is this is actually a pretty large study done of of average eating Tendencies from a large group of people on the North American.  And it just sort of goes over in a simple way. Are we eating too much or too little of things that are good or bad? You know, so this is a fairly dense chart what it basically says is Orange is either too little of something is good or too much of something this quote bad and felt like years added sugar is saturated fat sodium or salt and these are the things that most people say we should eat more vegetables fruit total grain Dairy not lots of dairy, but there is pretty healthy protein foods oils. These are all things you want to have in a certain amount and basically tend to eat lots of the bad thing. So they majority of people reading above the recommended amounts and below the the limit amounts for the things that are considered good. So this is basically is a trend that were sitting on a very large scale and you know, this is a very hard thing to approve and scientist don't prove things scientist test things. I just examining its it seems almost  Convertible that the industrialized food chain as incredibly convenient as it is is probably you know at fault for a very large number of biomedical and medical problems that were observing today in modern culture all over the world. Not just the United States any longer but that is definitely the epicenter of this it we're going to talk about that for sure. But now we have to start at Square One my people my grandchildren if you started square one and talk about talk about the digestive system digestion not means the gastrointestinal tract and it is what are these things like, you know, I teach mostly cellular and molecular kinds of things like biochemistry and stuff like that and that's why these classes exercise in this so enjoyable for me cuz I'm learning so much about the integrated large-scale view of things, but I tell people off and if you look at the biochemical Pathways in the Krebs cycle amino acid synthesis and breakdown, you know fat  Yes, as soon as bad as to break all the stuff that you heard it. And then you mediately try to vaporize to make room for the important shit like anime, you know, is that five years? I thought that caused by August. I had vaporized all of it and had it and I'm a biochemistry PhD so I totally get it. I get that you forget a whole education and say you're going to get your going to get cold serrated in Biochemistry, but I tell people I said, you know, there's so much going on in each cell in your body and you learn this from the biochemistry class and other classes. Do you believe you're just nothing all day? She'll be just doing times. You can just sit there all day metabolizing and B, you know have good credit and B-Legit working super-hard at the molecular level and I realize it's the same way and Physiology 2 is like so much is going on unbeknownst to us. Thanks the involuntary mechanisms that really work.  I'm just doing nothing all day. I never said that I'll take it up the podcast but you know, it's kind of beautiful example of extraction Factory events going on in our bodies all the time. See if you know a lot of this is probably refocusing the physiology that you learned and also there's no question that review and restatement of things is a great way to solidify it. So, you know, if you've heard this in physiology class, you know, my guess is that if you you know a lot about half of what we talked about if you remember every single thing from your physiology class, it would be hearing things and putting it into the context of thinking about nutrition and and and such is valuable because there's no question that nutrition starts with getting it into the body into the bloodstream in processing and what happens with that. So basically there's a long track the gastrointestinal tract in many many animals except for those  Words that have the same exit and entry Port Lowe's deuterostomes or whatever, you know, we have a gastrointestinal tract. We have a mouth and esophagus to stomach small intestine large intestine the number of accessory organs that all work together basically to take the food we eat and you know, one of the great things about mammals, especially these mammals what we are is where phenomenally omnivore we can process a lot of different food. It's amazing. It's one of the problems is that you know, like the reason is 58 different diets is because we're omnivores and we can live on a lot of different diets in the questions of whether they affect us this way or that way are really hard to answer an open questions, you know, there's some like I just koala bears eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves their eucalyptus oil for the jam their diet restrictions are much simpler. I've offered that we should put koala bears in the Eucalyptus Grove across campus cuz they want you're not going to go anywhere.  But I guess that I guess they are pretty ornery. You know, they're just not very nice. So they're cute and you want to pet them and there could be an incident, you know, a terrible incident and apparently eucalyptus leaves make them lose he or I guess they're alkaloids phytochemicals in that make them even more arnary. So perhaps having koala bears eat eucalyptus good weekend like this collection of organs and their Arrangement and we're going to sort of figure out what they do. And so the book has he's very fancy pictures that sort of an anatomical layout. So basically gastrointestinal tract is, you know, a linear flow system. I bet it starts with the mouth and salivary glands esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum. And anus and this is a you know, there's there's a collection of voluntary and involuntary.  Terry prophesied it all work together to allow us to consume food and one of the really great things about our digestion and part of this is down to the level of biochemistry as we don't have to eat constantly we can eat occasionally and have nutrients delivered to us gradually and also we can store them as glycogen and fat and really your valuable ways. And if there's no question that human evolution has many periods of Great Famine for we learned, you know by shuffling jeans in the cruelty of the darwinian experience to Us store food in ways in which stand for the fan. So this is you know, a part of it is and part of the digestive system is it's a gradual delivery of nutrients over. X safe. So I'm you know, I table of the functions that we're going to go over them bit by bit, you know one by one as we have the mouth basically that involves chewing and some digestion and its allies salivary gland we have you stopped.  Guess which is critical not only for passing the food would do it in a way where we don't choke ourselves a turns out. This is a very elaborate beautiful mechanism that separates breathing from eating and the email many drop some of you experience when that goes. All right. I'll never forget. I was eating a tri-tip meal at this restaurant down in PB house with a bunch of friends and I swallowed a piece of steak and plugged up my larynx life like how you literally was going to choke and I was like I never dis is never happened before I was actually incredibly, maybe it's my homies and Mom when I stopped cuz I live  I do not know how to tell people that nor do you want like a heimlich your wrestling match going on if you don't have to it's like so I just stopped and I said you must breathe out as hard as you must cough. And breathe out as Harding Academy is in Norma's Pizza steak, and it was the weirdest thing because I realize that that if I had probably breathing even a slight bit more who knows if I'll even be here cuz it was really like there was no air nut.  And I tried calculating how long do I have to live? So it was exactly is Borat function of that sort than you think is pretty amazing in the stomach and we have the processing killing bacteria. One of the amazing things about the stomach is it's really a phenomenal biochemical Gateway would be weird exception of those prion proteins that you know that are tightly folded and can you propagate their Miss structure to other proteins? If you not heard about them this incredibly interesting bio chemical phenomena, very cutting-edge disease stuff, but the stomach protect us from lots and lots of different Intruders that come with food at all. But you know, but plenty of them in the small intestines involved in the final digestion and that's where most of the nutrients get absorbed in the large intestine is also involved in in residual water minerals, and it's not listed here, but the really exciting part and I know this has been the exciting part of the houses the microbe  Most of the the gut microbiome and that is turned out to be an absolutely incredible field of modern science is the is the microbiome and I told if I were like 20 and going into science now, I would one of the things I'd seriously consider is going into microbiome research cuz it's just it's an incredible Vista it and you know, if you give you been inside those long as I have your very skeptical of new stuff, it's like your heart right great the genome. What's that people known there was an elaborate ecosystem of microbes enormous in the gut, but I don't think anyone realizes up till about 10 or 15 years ago how incredibly important it is in controlling tons of different mammalian functions, including mood calorie harvesting tendency towards obese just lots and lots and lots of things and you know, I was skeptical but now I'm  But I realize that it is a phenomenally important to a part of the of the human biology experiences this elaborate ecosystem that were harboring the bacteria. Like he's our life support system work here to do this. It's a pretty amazing and then we have the the, you know, the elimination function supercritical especially want to control them, you know, very important social Dynamic issues there and if you were Runner, you know that this is incredibly important cuz there was no better laxatives on the planet than running a mile absolutely Runners, you know that they participate intensely and Solid Waste Management before a race. It's absolutely critical and then we have the 303 Auto ancillary Oregon deliver the gallbladder in the pancreas and all three all of these work together to create basically a labret flow regulated bio.  Testing device that is both biological and mechanical and enzyme logical and straight chemical. So it's an amazing thing. We're going to take a trip through that this is actually useful for studying this table. I have your we're not going to go through all these things but it's a lot of detail from your book and sometimes it just valuable to have something like that in your notes in the slide in the podcast. This is a very detailed description of what these things do and it's it's valuable that way. So first of all that starts it all starts with chewing  And the human jaw and the job the mammal is amazing apparatus because it is so over muscle that has so much muscle as omnivores. We want to be able to tear me we going to be able to break, you know things with our teeth but we also don't want to have such a strong jaw that we can't speak, you know, so we have and we can't communicate in more subtle ways. So our job is sort of a compromise between the primates Osso primates off, you know, if you ever encounter like a rhesus monkey or a gorilla they have phenomenally strong Jaws, like it's amazing amount of power. They can generate again like cracking nuts stuff. So we are sort of a compromise if we have a very substantial amount of muscle. So these this is the  This is the joint the trend of mandibular joint this here. And then this is basically is the jaw that joint where the door opens and closes and there's this elaborate Hoops elaborate sheet of muscle that goes all the way up to the side of the head when someone is too and you can see, you know, their Temple oscillates and stuff and you know, that's you know, if you've ever bitten your tongue by accident that's usually a very subtle bite you realize how much force is involved and Mike Tyson. We need to save one of those big matches a little before your time enforcing. Boxing technique is has not lasted so it's up but you know, it's a whatever it takes I guess so you have this basic layout and the jaw muscles are phenomenally strong. This is a picture from Nigel's lectures and you know this basically is there a little wacky it sort of America's Got Talent in the jaw muscle but this person who is a phenomenally flexible Cantore.  The Nest is also able to balance using only their jaw muscles on this tripod, which is pretty amazing. It says a lot about the phenomenal strain you also if you go to the internet you can see all these cases of people lifting weights with just their jaw muscle with the leather thing. We have phenomenal strength in our Jaws. Okay. So the functions of the mouth, you know, many of these things have multiple functions the function of the mouth are to masticate break the food in the small part of oh, that's the fancy term for chewing is to masticate we do some digestion. We have salivary amylase is to break down carbohydrates important to realize this is only about 5% of the carbohydrates. It's not a whole it's not like you're producing lots of glucose from this secrete a great deal of mucus that is mucus is basically a set of glycoproteins that have really good a friction properties, you know, mucus is really good for lubricating food and keeping Aaron and other patches ways.  Moist and it's doesn't evaporate easily. So we lubricate the food and then it's antimicrobial also their license times that we produce that break down bacteria. So it helps for dental health another other bacterial protection, but it really important part of this alive experience is creating a solution of of molecules that we can taste and although you know, you might think it probably depends on who is teaching it. But you know, you could look and find nutrition to purely is biochemistry like breaking down carbohydrates and you know, glycogen production elapidae of not only eating a nutrition but also the kinds of things that are that are thought about and manipulated for good and for bad have to do with the taste of food and the S appetite when we talked about hunger and appetite and hunger is about fuel in biotech.  Chemical need an appetite is about the way these Foods, you know motivate us then they're both super important, you know, like it's they're both super important but a big part of what we do with the mouse is create a a taste environment is also when we talk more about the food chain and Manufacturing food. I want to get into this there's a whole science and what food seemed like to to the person eating them and theirs is actually a wonderful term called mouthfeel. I'll write it here in terms of this mouth though. It's getting a little ahead of our time that we will talk about it. So now I feel is an actual food science term bond house food field in the mouth and it's a giant part of manufacturing food and making it appealing. This is just one example of this goes Way Beyond in just the biochemistry, but what are the things that that is clear is that we have a labret sensors for tasting things and it turns out the Bayou  Neurobiology of these things is just fascinating. It's something people go into this field of how we perceive taste and make a living doing it cuz it's so interesting in involved so that you know, how long would be incredibly important for speech is also incredibly important for Taste and probably it was important for Chase way before it was important for speech seems reasonable that off on it that are in map there and then a set of what are called taste buds and taste buds are actually little collections of multiple cells and B cells have expressed a street sceptres and their receptors in taste.  Taste receptor cell with a call that TRC will get that. Let me see if that's here. Yeah, it's just taste receptor sound of taste receptors. So I'll go back now. Sorry getting a little ahead of myself. Each of these each of these cells within a taste bud is a conglomerate of cells that each Express a single taste receptors are thinking of it and currently and there is you'll notice as he's a review article from nature from 2006. If you if you PubMed and and restricted to reviews and put taste receptors you get hundreds of review articles about this is very active field research parsley, cuz the science is so interesting about signal integration and processing and also because it's so commercially important like, you know, the more that the food industry's understand about what makes things taste the way they do the better or the worse depending on your view. Okay. So basically they're these different ways. The tongue has taste buds Rangers gif  Regions Enterprise learn this you know high school that there's there's different parts of the tongue that are more sensitive the flavors in other parts, you know, when you can throw to play around with this but the receptors actually have so far there's six different receptor bass taste and I say this so far because this is as I mentioned a very active field of research and all the molecules that that all the genes that encode taste receptors have not been fully worked out. Some of them are deposited like this probably isn't a precept others have been cloned and sequence is mutated understood very deeply. So it's it's the messiness of an active feel that some of the receptors are deeply understood some of them, you know are almost not guesswork but hypothesize, okay, but the flavors and the cool thing is these flavors were worked out way before anyone had any molecular biology and you can do these simple for the cycle physics experiments and find out what people so they're sweet for things like glucose and plant sugar is in tasty stuff.  Salt for salty things, especially the electrolytes we need better. There's Umami Umami is the Savory flavor that MSG enhance is the reason people put MSG in food is doing is to help tickle those Umami receptors that are basically Savory things and if you're like me when I'm ready to be allowed to have a Savory thing and a sweet thing and I also wait between eating an egg, you know like that. So it's orange juice and baking right same idea. So Savory sweet and salty that's my bacon is so awesome. Right and then there's sour that's especially important for fermented but not only that you lemons and citrus and then this is kinda interesting as they now think the carbonation itself is a flavor that's registered because there's is wonderful experiments. You can show the carbonated water causes a very strong neural response in the tongue in the flavor sensing and at this point, it's not clear. What is the carbonation sensor?  You know, if a lot of people like I almost only drink carbonated beverages and part of that's just my childish behavior from when I was a kid, I wasn't ever allowed to answer when I'm grown up. I'm going to drink nothing. But yes, sir.  Barney  Can it be the carbonation for oppressor don't you drink any of the crew and my brother has the carbonation is Independence the questions that could it be the carburetors on a pair of the people who do this. I answer to get that and they know you can't a carbonated liquid so don't have sweeteners in them too. And you get him the interesting thing is you get a very strong almost like a ticket. These molecules are called paste in like an old fashioned and you get a very strong tasting signal from purely carbon dioxide being dissolved in water. So it seems like there's a carbon dioxide or carbon Nation signal is distinct and Prince absent room you start combining these things you get very strong response is so that's actually true like but there's an interesting. I believe I read out of this is there's a whole industry now of beverages better taste their flavored but not sweet. You know, I better like there's a kind of water called hint and hinges not carbonated and its flavored and someone made a fortune off of that.  Cuz it's like zero calorie, but it's better than drinking water or more tasty been drinking water. And now there's just there's a brand of beverages with bubbly. And this one's called Lacroix that I have you seen a fancy flavors like papaya mango and raspberry lime, but they're basically carbonated flavored water, you know, and they hit people are freaking out like why but that's sort of the thing but I'll save it a V6 different flavors. There's there's thinking that there's other things that we can sense that aren't that well understood including certain ions. So this is an ongoing active deal. Okay. And so this is actually a really nice review from my 2009 and there's other ones common sense about taste from a most insects. And one thing that special about this is this guy Charles zuker is incredibly great scientist who used to be or he was here for years when I was here then he moved out to Columbia to be with each other. There's a there are people there who cares  Cadre of people have won the Nobel Prize for for both olfaction and other neural things and so they have a very strong critical mass with no sense. And finally they lured him there. He was a great Professor to have here incredibly interests. If you see a chance to hear Charles zuker speak I scraped zuker is is Spanish for sugar or Sweet and if he is he's actually one of the people is cloned a lot of these taste receptors and he gives it absolutely amazing talk and sort of taste perception and using super fancy, you know, optogenetics and stuff to study Tay signaling very cool very cool science. But anyways, this is a review article in this is just a graph in from that article know you don't have to know this of I'm showing you this only that you know that this is a very active very complex field. So I'm going to be in put the lights down low. So this is actually some of the receptors in these are ones that are very well-known and then these are ones that are less well understood so  For the carbonated they think it might be that the receptor is is carbonic anhydrase because there's your car battery has an enzyme that very rapidly converts carbonic acid back in to see if your CO2 into carbonic acid the interesting about this particular Carbonic anhydrase is it's anchored to a cell membrane. So it's sort of looks like a receptor but it's there to process CO2. So that's that's the level that they really don't understand much about that one. But so this is just show you that it's complex. There's lots of different tastings, you know, it seems like the bitter ones are our evolve to protect us from you know things we might sample out in the world and toxins that can arise where is the sweet salty Umami her about attracting us and making us consume things that you know are good for energy type fuels. Okay. So this is that again  And as I say the taste buds have these beautiful taste receptor. So so there are they really are a bun with Bud shape. There is little round a collections of cells along the tongue there's hundreds of them and each each taste bud cell or ttrc taste receptor cell is expressing a different separate Jean know how they know to do. This is another interesting will I go to buy a logical problem, you know, and and so each taste bud a sort of a Reception Center for different flavors and pretty cool. And like I say that the way these taste bud connect up to the neural system the way that you get the wiring on the way that they repair themselves in these are all incredibly interesting science it we're not going to talk about cuz we're going to focus on nutrition. Okay. So one of the things that we know is is you might say we'll shoot their only five taste receptors and there's millions of foods and you like some you don't like them to one of the things we know is it tapers receptors interact with each other?  No question that there's a sweet spot for salt salty and sweet. That's really irresistible to eat never have kettle corn kettle corn because I love it so much. I'll do things like like this is pathetic, but I'm just want to relate you know is all go to the store and buy a thing of kettle corn like this big and I'll eat too much of it. And then I throw it all in the garbage if I feel like all that fiscal bulimia, like I threw it in the garbage because I don't want to eat all of it and I will end this thing about the energy go to a carnival where they making a big Kettle. If you can't stop eating it if you can't even in my car driving with one hand going like this, but it's terrible. I think should probably be texting kettle corn and alcohol in that order a danger in I'm going and that's really just a sweet spot, you know an optimal space between sweet and salty at Lisa's friend.  I've had people friends of mine who didn't never had it out of here try this and then next thing you know that can you open a universal sodium but you know, it interacts with the salt receptor unless in 100 ml of sodium attract when we have that much so salt in food or you know that kind of concentration on the top song in the saliva. It tends to send a more positive signal that works with the other things that you know, you've been taste buds are working in one way but 300 millimolar sodium too much sodium what it does is it activates of bitter and sour receptors? So it cross-react with those receptors and turns them on to make us a verse to sodium and then there is the kind of experiment. Charles area crew are incredibly good at it. Don't take mice and knock out certain receptors and see how they didn't respond to different flavors in and you know inputs and you can prove or if you can show that if you get rid of the sweet and sour receptors the anime  Who is there a verse in the salt that they will just eat that does not have a high point where they'll stop beating it, you know, but this is Sweet Spot is very evident both in manufacturing food. And in the kinds of things that we would like to eat and I like okay another example, there's this incredible donut shop called of modoo donuts see what other news I should teach us cuz his ime give me empty calories in as many as possible. And so what day is a donut star that starred in Portland, Oregon and now they're in Eugene in Seattle called boo do donuts and they're very all you know, everyone in there has at least a pound of metal on their faces and you don't need to remove them from  Yeah, why do some people I mean there's a lot in terms of you knows food preference. There's a lot of variability and some of it might be difference is a receptor but a lot of it can be what you used to cultural in a we also beat the physiology of fencing things is definitely let you know adjustable at the personal level is a great question because some people you know, like other people can't stand it. A lot of that I think comes from just what you're used to also, you know, it's you know, I'm people are people who eat out a lot, you know, go to restaurants all the time. No, find home cooked food near pretty bland it first and I'll add a lot to it. There's a great story about Henry Ford, you know, the guy who invented, you know, oppressive industrialization, you know for a job like amazing job, he'd go to dinner with them and watch if they add insult in their food before tasting it he wouldn't hire them because that means  I bet they were do something out of happens at a thinking. I'm getting a call. That's very weird is like a we're not going to think FaceTime Mom. I thought you were dead. I'm about to say that, it would be weird. If I'm on FaceTime on a clear that up. My mother is long gone. I've no wish for my mom to be gone. Okay?  So Henry Ford, okay. We're back to stop. Okay, but what are the things that's amazing is because they have these molecular tools to study receptors. Like you can one of the great things about molecular biology and darwinian evolution combined as if you have a gene for something you can study where that came from how it changed your different species how it rows. What's a lot of wonderful fascinating things to learn about the past from the present. It's like a giant molecular retrospective study if you want and so one of the things people have done if they take these receptors and they are combined it with with your behavioral experiments as well as observation experiments and say what kind of things can animals taste. So it's quite clear that a whole bunch of carnivores don't have sweet dick can't taste sweet. They can't taste sugar in this is actually first learned in cats. Okay, this explains why my cat has a Love's yogurt that doesn't care at all about sweet things. He is.  Addicted to Goat yoga. That's a whole separate story kind of fun. But it's like pretty much all your day has been telling him know you can of goat yogurt until that one minute in the morning and women in the evening when he gets it in. The rest of life is not worth living. Well, he's sleeping but they don't send sweets their school. They're receptor, which is called that I don't have it. But there sugar receptor that you can see the sweet receptors a certain subclasses highly similar but most medals has been converted into what's called a pseudogene and cats no longer expressed. So this group actually who first discovered that up for the cat has this is gray one because it's he's all the red triangles are diamonds are animals that no longer have a functioning or present sweet receptors of the whole bunch of carnivores. And what's interesting about cats is cats remember from remember from  Metabolic, we talked about gluconeogenesis and that's a way to make glucose and it's one way to keep your blood sugar up. If you haven't consumed a lot cats pretty much all of the sugar that they have in their bloodstream synthesized. They are constitutive gluconeogenic glucose makers they actually and it's because they eat nothing but mice if you look at a mouse or screws or little birds, they're almost no carbohydrate. Yeah. Yes. They have a little bit of Livery Luggage in but it doesn't amount to anything. It's a miniscule amount of the total. So an animal like a cat that he's nothing but protein to make their glucose. They have to make it all of it from car and you know, you all know if I'm taking 102 from me or Erin Coleman or any of the other awesome teachers that you can only make glucose from carbon skeletons from amino acids are from glycerol. I can't make it from fatty acids. If you don't know that go back to 102 so cats. Basically Ark  To be making glucose and this is why it's so easy to get a diabetic cat because those foods like the Purina Chows are full of carbohydrates that they don't need a real thing to feed a cat besides goat yogurt is is liver. They just they do really great on Shirley carnivore diet since like the catkins diet, no carbs or protein are biochemically set up to do that question.  Wonderful other possible there other cases registered there certainly are and that's a very tough nut to crack. Like how do you know an animal's tasting something? That's different. I mean, it's a wonderful question. I think possibly Mike molecular biology might help cuz you might find in the taste bud cells of an animal I'd receptor. We don't know about the one of the end there are what's call the orphan taste receptors. So so this is a term when you do molecular biology, you can through signature sequence to sequence signature say this is clearly a taste receptor. We don't know what but it's measuring and this can get completely crazy. So you've actually so one of the things is but just six receptors and you don't have to be a Gourmand or a gourmet to know that people will talk endlessly about the way things taste like them has a crappy strawberries and leather a little tannic where do the six receptors come from here to strawberries a little tannic, you know a bit of Whiplash and some anger, you know, whatever.  And the fact is that is a huge part of tasting a huge part of it is to olfaction and the olfactory receptors a whole different animal of the same species. So unlike states were there 6 maybe a few cryptic ones? We don't know about there are thousands of olfactory receptors. So here's this is a really neat picture of what we think animals can smell. So what this is a very good and you can already tell from this at this field is super mature because we have information like that. So the red or the number of functioning olfactory receptor genes are actually the cool thing about olfaction is they are almost all the same receptor subtype called a g protein-coupled receptor. You may have learned about biology yet and we just make hundreds of different variants of these and now this is why there are so many subtle smells like a human. Can I think recognize a few thousand different smells you can easily measure that and  Reason we can do that is because even though we're very low on this totem pole. We only have 386 functioning receptors opposed to the elephant which has 1948 functioning off that are receptors. Are we still even with 348 that is a lot of combinations and they're not triggered by individual thinks they are activated by things but any combination of foods remember a cup of coffee as a thousand molecules in it is a whole beautiful Matrix of different degrees of stimulation of receptors. So now it's easy when you add this to to tasting things to get a very complex set of flavors the crazy thing about this and this addresses the question. It was just asked these receptors are known about almost entirely through molecular biology. It's quite clear that they are. Yeah, I'm beat me the genes are expressed only in the olfactory epithelium in the each each cell makes one type in that neuron goes into the factory bulb assembly. It's incredible wiring diagram very beautiful.  Most of the we have no idea what the molecule is it stimulates and we don't know what the basic molecule is. It called the all faction. Some of them we do a lot of them. We don't see these are mostly orphan receptors that are waiting for some smart scientist to figure out what stimulates them. But the whole thing about that is it creates this this elaborate set of information that tells us that were eating and that were liking it or not like it like that and it makes a lot more sense in food preference can be so varied because you know, you have a lot of different signals going on. It's a lot of variability in how you know, what a what a food will take psych but it is interesting that probably most Foods taste the same different people. They just responded and they've either like them or not, you know, so next thing that happens if you have to swallow once you chew up the food is called a bolus. And so this bolus is partially digested. It has mucus it as enzymes that has lysozyme. It's you know, fairly neutral and pH and it's quite  Swallowable and so that Bolas ends up going down the esophagus and there's actually two parts of the upper esophageal sphincter, which is so sprinklers have a terrible, you know, a terrible word association, but they're unbelievably important in gastrointestinal physiology. They basically control the flow of favor called biological control valves, that would be much cooler in a few biological control valve, but they're phenomenal important for for controlling the flow both involuntary and voluntary. So the upper esophageal sphincter is the only voluntary sphincter until we get to the very end. And that is you basically when we initiate swallowing and the cool thing is that there's a little a little bit of tissue called the epiglottis here and the epiglottis is an amazingly important control device because when the Epic when we swallow a bolus the epiglottis this way and closes off the larynx.  Now when I was eating at tri-tip, here's the tri-tip and here's what happened to me. So I needed to push air that weighs super quick with presents of Mind by sight show this to the epiglottis actually protect us from really catastrophic occurrences on a daily basis without us having any awareness of it, you know, and now I'm and it's it's one of those things. Also if food went down the trachea even small bits that didn't make you choke it can cause intense infections and problems in the long because the long is a very sort of immune is if it's a pretty protected environment so long infections can be insulted just a massive amount of surface area to so thank you epiglottis. And then there's a lower the lower sphincter called the lower esophageal sphincter of the cardiac sphincter that controls the opening and closing of the stomach and the esophagus and I will talk a little bit more about that. So then the next  Can you have the stomach flu stomach is located here in one of the beautiful things about the GI system as it's highly asymmetric near one of the sort of wonderful problems in in developmental biology. How do you take a zygote? That's perfectly symmetrical and make this wildly asymmetric organism. That's a whole other field of biology. But this is one of the best examples of that your stomach's hear your liver's there did you do and so the stomach is is this, you know, basically a sack and the cool thing about this is it can go from a few milliliters in volume two are almost over a gallon if it's completely full, you know, so it's it has his phenomenal ability to restore great amounts of liquid or food or not when sperm gets in the stomach this bolus that you swallow or multiple Bowl Li cuz you're having a meal with many bytes. It goes in there in the stomach actually has a number of different cells. So we'll talk about that.  It is basically the stomach solubilized. I just moved both mechanically as well as a biochemical Ian. And the main thing is stomach. This is a sidify the food God create an acidic environment. The pH is Route 1 to 2. And that's a pretty a pretty low PH. Remember the lower pH is the more acidic it is and it does it by secreting hydrochloric acid. So the hydrochloric acid is released the acid denatures proteins to great denaturing and inactivates salivary amylase, which is not here. No there hydrolyzes carbohydrates dissolves minerals killed micro activates pepsinogen and so pepsinogen is a precursor of pepsin that self activates by cleavage and it's an acid dependent produce. And so basically the stomach releases pepsinogen that's a precursor to pepsin which is a protease of Cleves is peptide bonds pretty across-the-board. It releases mucus to keep. Things lubricated and keep things in suspension.  And it releases a substantial amount of acid. Another cool thing is the whole gastrointestinal tract has two layers of muscle to do peristalsis in mix into the stomach has three layers. It's an incredibly muscular organ and it can squeeze in a lot of different ways. He's Incredible movies from gastrointestinal surgery that show the stomach moving an oscillating and it's it's it's amazing actually Saudi the stomach is arranged. The surface has sweater called gastric pits. So gastric pits go down in here, and then there's three kinds of cells. There's parietal cells that release HCL. There's Chief cells that release pepsinogen and their surface mucus cells. It also release mucus. I have not that of a clever acronym for parietal cells, and she sells their Chief. We're releasing a pepsinogen. I don't have any idea why that's useful to remember. They're just this Earth terms that are not easy to remember and if any of you come up with clever acronyms for why parietal cells release HCL, please tell me  Because of that school I'm so they're going to rain just a beautiful arrangement of all of this. You don't release its really like almost like an industrial level Factory where you have this processing going on, by the way that they you might think how in the world is a stomach release hydrochloric acid, like first of all the time and the mucus that we reduce also protects the stomach tissue from this hydrochloric acid is in a phenomenal tissue because it can withstand such a low PH like a pH of 1 is nasty, you know, if you ever regurgitated you will notice that that time is really uncomfortable. And the first thing you have to do is get it out away from tissues and are protected. But the great thing about this, is it the parietal cells to who sells that released the release the acid do it by a very clever combination of I am transporter. So there's a heightened is a bicarbonate chloride.  Antiporter. So that's a term. I've used it before but will caught an antiporter.  Yeah, I use this because of the mouth feeling destroyed our own thing. So and antiporters are transported. It moves one thing one way and the other another way to keep the charge balance the same usually not always charge bouncer other antiporters, but it's a transporter in a memory that moves things in opposite directions as its natural function. And so what happens is you have this lovely production of bicarbonate to Carbonic anhydrase. This is an enzyme you've heard about before that will dissociate naturally. It caused by carbonic acid does dissociate and physiological pH bicarbonates pumped out chloride is pumped into than another pump pumps protons out in the chloride is passively removed to balance charge. So you get this really nice production of HCL a separation of its negative charge and a concomitant replacement with chloride that allows HCL to the tune of a pH of 3 or 1 in the gastrointestinal tissue. So this  Beautiful examples for the highly highly evolved usage of substandard. I am transported in one of the things that people cell biologist study is he cells are highly asymmetrical like every cell is facing the bloodstream one way with a bunch of Transporters in one side. And then on the other side, it has all these chloride and hydrogen transport a silver. The movement is is is vecturo many tissues in the gastrointestinal system and other places that are highly asymmetrical. So there's a top and a bottom a basolateral and an apical membrane is called that allow that so this beautiful developmental biology. Thanks to the one of the things about the stomach. Is it becomes this way gradually when we went when we approach after were born so one of the places it's real important in medicine is this idea of the infant stomach the infant stomach is not mature. And so one of the reasons that you have to feed babies, is this baby food, you know, this is this infant food is because their stomachs  Not yet ready to wish to respond up to solid food to a baby of lesson when you're one of the this is just some anecdotes that have come up as you should not feed a baby raw, honey. And you think it's natural organic but raw, honey that you get maybe straight from a beehive, you know, a lot of farmers markets and it hasn't been you know, pasteurized can have botulinum toxin in it. Now. We normally a botulinum spores in his custody and botulinum, which is one of the most poisonous bacteria. I figure there's no Botox people in your pie safe making that joke with clostridium botulinum spores in their stomach and not kill them if they're not big enough acid and it can be catastrophic. Okay, so it's interesting also that there's a transition between a milk Thai food.  Breastfeeding and and solid food I run 4 to 6 months. It's a real it's just the stomach gradually developed into the sort of young adult form and it for months. It's at you can start feeding a child and it's actually a whole scientific literature on when is the best time to start eating a child solid food? And the thinking is that between four and six months is good. And if you switch to early this is been correlated not with a lot of mechanism yet with increase risk of diabetes in adulthood obesity in adulthood and celiac disease and the actual mechanisms that are not well understood but these are the epidemiological comparisons it seem like there's a sweet spot for when you switch a child and it has to do with the stomach being mature.  Choke the stomach has two speakers at to control valves. When is this lower esophageal sphincter? For some reason? It's not clear to me. It's called the cardiac sphincter. I don't know why that is maybe cuz it's up near the park but it does nothing to do with heart function. Do not be tricked by it the lower esophageal sphincter and the pyloric sphincter. The lower esophageal sphincter is super important for not getting refluxes into the esophagus and people to get older start having gastric reflux and not just older people. But some people have poor control of the esophageal sphincter for a variety of reasons and they can get acid reflux. It can be very uncomfortable and then is the pyloric sphincter in the pyloric sphincter if I soak your hair is the pyloric sphincter is separates the stomach from the from the small intestine and this is actually an amazingly important dial because the stomach is full of Highly acidic kind it's called that's what that's what after the stomach material is made its called kind.  And again, this is on the slide for this a lot of this that you know, you can if a term isn't here you still may be responsible and it will be on the terms list. Okay, but be so the pyloric sphincter releases just ml is at a time in the day end of the small intestine to a full stomach takes a long time to release the material which is good and get a gradual reduction in calorie that we got to talk about. This so-called a time is the first part of the intestine and you'll hear people using both terms. So I looked into this both are okay. You can say duodenum you can say duodenum or duodenum. Those are both. Okay. And so if you hear someone going painful don't think they're being arrogant or mispronouncing. They're both. Okay? Okay. I don't know. It'd be fun to clicker up and see who did you watching them into the duodenum type phenotype tomato and tomato, right? Okay, so we have that.  And then as long as we're talking about this, this is the major control valves a major sevinc. There is that are important in in this process and they're actually all really want the lower esophageal sphincter protects from reflux. The pyloric sphincter controls the flow into the intestine. The hepatopancreatic sphincter sphincter is the one that allows the secretion of bile into the into the gastrointestinal mix. We'll talk about the Elio rectal sphincter controls the movement from the small intestine large intestine and that's critical to keep bacteria from the elaborate microbiome out of the small intestine and the anal sphincter is incredibly important for controlled release of the solid waste. So these are all very important control valves super important part of it. We can do a little quicker but you know what I'm thinking I was just do some quick run the boss if we get behind what is that?  That doesn't mean you should click slowly. Alright. Alright ready get your clickers out. Let's do this to this.  Ready?  When are movie I?  we ready it's a a  Ready?  When a movie I buy their popcorn I sneak in food alternatives.  I don't eat food in the movies. I don't go to the movies.  All right.  Nice turnout. I'm actually curious about this. So a substantial number of people almost 30% by the movie popcorn and you will want to stop doing that. I actually buy the movie popcorn and I always miss I get the child that's almost everything and then many of you sneak movie movie theater. Now, they have those computers to help you by the illegal food. Can they give you like a fake pocket in your shirt? And then I don't go I don't eat food. I don't go to movies, people if I stayed home with a 90 in screen, right? Okay, so that's cool. Alright, very interesting. I thought that that is interesting to me. How much of your food is prepared by The Loving Hands of someone making food.  or machines  less than 10% between 10 and 50% almost all  turn this environment. It's quite possible.  All right.  Etsy  I am  So lots of you have at least a third or half of your meals, some of you most of your meals are our cafeteria and I make sense because it's so convenient. If you're a student here supposed to be live on campus that would make a lot of sense so and some 100% of meals and it is one of the conundrums we face as if you know where the industrialized culture is the convenience as well as the deliciousness and prepared food, you know, it's it is interesting conundrum the occupation I would like to have this is just pure I'm purely. There's no right answer to this, you know, but I'm curious I'd like to be a physician a non-physician health professional a biomedical Sciences something other than a b or c which is again, there's no right answer to this time purely purely curious.  That will be our texts Master General, but I forgot my phone, okay?  All right. We're almost done.  stop  few more time to decide you're not going to be held at this answer. All right of C.  Lodi want to be Physicians about 40% I would have thought it was hire non. Non-physician health professional.  Biomedical scientist other that's pretty, say that one that's interesting to me.  And again, there's no judgments. It's all great. Great that you can even think about that kind of a future. Yay. A luxury problem. Okay vitamin C is a I'm just curious if you know this a phytochemical zoochemical a source of calories a molecule of the Krebs cycle, which is it. Just answer.  best answer  Okay, we have to stop.  A phytochemical that is true, but there's an incredibly interesting Twisted is somebody observed many many years ago it awaits. Those are the Alaskan, you know, the native First Nation Alaskan Earth Sweet Nothing But Glover what you know of seal blubber and stuff didn't get scurvy call of the Scarab III the British Sailors who have to go on a long enough Boyd start getting terrible joint problems and college in promise to the vitamin C's importance and maintenance of collagen in joints in a wood screw me and it turns out that those animals they eat are actually producing vitamin C from a biochemical pathway that we have about 90% of but we've lost inside executor jeans release certain Oceanic animals of the annuity provide their vitamin C. Is that awesome and wild crazy thing my friend. Jim Wilhelm made me  Is he is a questor. Okay, so normally it's a phytochemical but it can be a zoochemical that's not a trick question. That's just a crazy at most of the places we get vitamin C is from fruits and vegetable you'd have to really go to a lot of links to get your vitamin C from meat. Okay 5 lesson. Did you run the Triton 5K? I'm purely curious.  denture  or walk enough to run participate participate  Wow.  All right last  they'll be more science. I promise I promise. All right. Well, okay.  Hey saw a bunch of you. Definitely didn't run it. Okay.  And only 11 people in the class ran it over then and then no and then 28.  All right, that's awesome. Okay, I just was curious. I thought it was super fun. 4,000 people that race. All right in the middle of this whole thing. I got there's a lot of questions about taste preference receptors in much of that is not known and I certainly don't know it but one of these is the cardiac sphincter is named that because people call acid reflux heartburn as a burning sensation to seem to come from the heart pretty good. I wonder if that's true. Is that a Google thinks I'm a Google it sounds reasonable to me it also you feel it up around here. But I've no idea this true another question when we were in a fasted state or haven't eaten. Well do our stomachs over instead of buying cause increased damage is actually very regulated in terms of when is producing acid as a response to be the parietal cells are actually very good at their stimulated by hormones and we'll talk a bit more about that's a great question though. How many people on your team beat you at? 171 people that came in 13 beat me? Haha. So there we go.  Okay, so then we're going to talk about the intestine intestine as a generalized structure of two layers of muscle and it can do multiple things. You can do the peristalsis, which is the movement of material along it but it also can do this oscillatory motion where it it grinds and mixes or young mixes material. So once the liquid enters the intestine of the small intestine, it's highly acidic chyme and it's put in a little at a time and one of the things that the pancreas does his release bicarbonate so you probably know the pancreas is glucagon and Insulin but that's actually a minor Supra a minor in terms of quantitation, but it's super important function of pancreas of those metabolism controlling hormones, but one of the pancreas is released enzymes and bicarbonate and it has to release enough bicarbonate for many many Livio many liters of acid is produced in a day. So the bicarbonate the pancreas releases  So basically there's the small intestine has three meters total length in Inhumans 3 ft long and wide is the duodenum. However, you want to preserve. It describes about 10 in the first part and it releases sodium bicarbonate from the pancreas releases sodium bicarbonate into it. I saw somewhere bio is added to it to be mixed with a kind and it is a jejunum and ileum that are all part of the process again. It ends with the ileocecal sphincter, which is prevents the colon contents from from reflecting back into the small intestine. So it's all compartmentalised. Okay, and so the intestine has just kind of out of a look with face you happy.  Stomach the pyloric sphincter that controls the flow the duodenum or duodenum and it's here that you also have that Pacho biliary sphincter that is important for a release of bile and pancreatic liquid. Okay. So the thing is so that time flows from the stomach to the small intestines controlled by the people are expecting her. It's worth a few emails at a time so we can get neutralization and human digestive completed involve. So in the small intestine is where most of the most of the absorption of nutrients but it is also involves enzymes are chemicals produced by the pancreas the liver and the small intestine including bio lipases break down fats protease enzymes break down proteins. Chymotrypsin. Trypsin glycosidase is the Cleve sugar changed and amylase. Is it break down that break down start over the whole bunch of Pang of enzymes that are being produced by these different sources that allow  The production of these small molecules to be absorbed. So this is where the absorption of most nutrients and minerals happens in the small intestine. Okay, as soon as I said pretty incredible structure, it is basically a two but is it to with many many many structural modifications to give a huge surface area. So it basically has what it called Villi. It looks sort of like fingers these are protrusions and then the Villi also have cells that that produce order called microvilli to add to the surface area even more and so the basic way to look at it is there these cell calls and the pink eye be the small intestine each villus, you know, this is one Villas has a whole bunch of epithelial cells in each of those epithelial cells has like a hairy Bart Simpson top, you know has his see how these microvilli so these cells are highly asymmetric. Do they have a bottom layer that faces the Lumen of the small intestine in of the Lumen of the Villi be  Pinterest extracellular fluid and then a top part that's facing the the the Lumen of the of the intestine. Where is a very important word to understand to I'll put it here illuminous just a space created by a closed issue or closed cell or enclosed organelle or compartment. Okay. And so what school is that? Each Villas has both capillaries and and lymph ducts called loot eels. And these are the two liquid systems at harvest the stuff that comes out of the intestine both lymph and blood. Okay. And so the total sorry the total surface area of the intestine by this increased Villi and microvilli is 600 times the surface area of just a three-foot-long to about that big cut open. So take a surface area and it allows us to absorb calories for a fishing. This is a really neat picture making that more clear is this is the Lumen hear the in  Space and all of this is Villi and microvilli produced. Okay, so it's basically it's like a a a sort of a dust mop through a liquid is flying with lots of surface area in one of the things about intestine. So the stomach is it turns over is tissue but it's also highly protected by the secretions that are produced but the intestinal cells their strategy for dealing with all this constant chemical in salt is to turn the cells over. So the intestine turns its microvilli epithelium over every to every 3 to 5 days. And so one of the reasons that chemotherapy is so problematic for intestinal for absorption and nausea and promise would be with the gastrointestinal system is that growing cells are very sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents chemotherapy 2-inch basically do things to screw with cellular mitosis, and when cells are going super fast that's invaluable strategy to protect.  Call from rapidly growing cancer cells are rapidly like Scout sells or intestinal cells suffered greatly from Madison downside of chemotherapy. This actually shows a this is a y a micrograph of alliances a micrograph of a few Min Villi after chemotherapy. Okay, and this is a three-dimensional picture what they look like. These are the finger-like projections to Dad surface area. So if you know, it's an important part of the whole thing for the Regeneration of the said the small intestine lining happens every 3 to 5 days of constantly renewing it and every generation compared Villi are destroyed and can absorb nutrients can be caused by malnutrition. Okay, cuz you don't have enough parts to build it. So that is something we're long-term fasting or starvation could be problematic how pathogens chemotherapy toxins and information to inflammatory bowel disease, which is a complex interplay between the, you know, the things we need in our response with them.  And not that well understood is in an endo inflammatory way to hurt these cells then we finally have a large intestine and the colon okay in the colon is pretty much be is the has a few very important function. So it's involved in absorbing electrolytes in water is about 30% of the water. So the amazing thing is only 1% of the water that we consume comes out in the in the fecal matter. So 99% of the water that we consume that passes through the gut is absorbed about 70 through the small intestine and about 30% of the small intestine. This tells you why I it is my diarrhea is such an easy to acquire syndrome. Cuz if you take the water that you are reabsorbing and double the amount you don't reabsorbed meaning it's a very small fraction program from 99% to 98%. Does a drastic change in the composition of what comes out even though it's a very small change in what's being  Very sensitive indicator as we all know from our own experiences of that of illness for Sleep goes away pretty quickly. I think I have the stop now cuz it's 3:20, and I don't want to make you Russell so "
