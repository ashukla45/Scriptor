    "Full Transcript": "All right.  Okay. Alright.  so, it's Thursday a  We're continuing with our discussion. We're a lecture behind but I'm the boss. Just learning how to do this. All is well and we will just adjust with Nigel Crawford Luxury Salon, so don't worry, they'll be no jarring in past 2 weeks from now not next week, but the week after I'm going to be away for two of those lectures at a fancy scientific conference. So I will but Nigel who created this course will give you two lectures and I'm sure they'll be quite good. He's very diverse than this baterial. Okay. Let's see if couple of course of course things.  How do we assign credit? I know this is an issue because all my discussion section I-80 is going over and it's a fair question is very fair question. So basically the way we sign credit is there midterm is 200 points. The final is 300 seat numbers are just completely arbitrary cuz we do it by a percentage. So it's just the more points on a midterm the easier it is to assign credit. So don't freak out that it's like a lot of points. The discussions are 20 points. I want you to notice. It's a very tiny fraction of the total. So if you do in your wisdom choose not to go it's probably not going to be a big impact, but I don't want to hear  That you decided not to go and then you missed your 20 points. Okay, we give full credit for 70% participation 0 4 Less you make sure it's fair cuz everyone has the same ratio that's called Fair it maybe it's a little unkind but here's why is the discussion sections work by people coming in participating by forming a discussion group. So going to out of 7 or 10 times is not useful to anybody. Okay, we want you to be part of a discussion group or you discuss stuff. Okay, so that's why and again it might seem Draconian but it's a teeny fraction of the total of 20 points out of 530. So it's really not a lot the clickers even more so it's 10 points out of the total because we'd like to have you here. We like to use the clickers both of those things. But again, it's not the other one at 70% for just participation. There's no right or wrong in clicker world. It's just doing it.  That is as good as this. Okay. So that's the way it works. I'll post these on the on the  on the Triton add to that would be there. Okay, the final will be cumulative but it'd be 2/3 new stuff went through it all with the caveat that these courses you can't really divide the old and the new because I might mention a nutrient in a new thing and you have to know where that nutrient is. So, you know what I'm saying, but will try to parse it a little bit. Okay, I'm speaking of discussion section. I'm trying something new. I'm excited about this and one of the great things about nutrition and attrition literature is it you all know this just from Reading, you know news feeds and not as there's a massive amount of study going on all of the time about what we should eat what we should meet what's good for us was bad for us has lots of interest in that there's lots of money in it. There's lots of a scientific question still open as lots of controversy and a recent thing that happened was a study came out then once again said eggs are bad so many years ago people.  Eggs are bad people aren't so bad. Then people said XR. Okay. Now we're back to eggs are bad again. So this is the actual study their bad again study and it looks all fancy. You know, it's in Journal of American Medical Association. So it's a very legit Sirius through it all and what I did was I posted this that the first author's name is Zhang. So that's why it's called is Young eggs study here. Let me do it this way or let me Spotlight the drawing a study for you song egg study. Okay, and so I want you to have a look at this. You don't have to read it. You don't just study it. You just have to have a look at it. I want each of you raise your right hand.  I swear.  I will at least have a look at it.  So help me Randy. All right, that's pretty pretty arrogant of me. Right? So help me Randy.  Is like magic, you don't even have to lift a piece of paper just have a look at it the scroll through it read that the beginning of this a little abstract thing with inclusions are and just look at the mess and sectors. I want you to understand how incredibly complicated be studies are the problem. And so what we have a problem is some everybody wants to know if your not I'm a big fan reasonable question. But if you go to the primary literature you see you look at you. I don't know how she'd eat eggs are not from this study clinical value of eating eggs half of the time. I don't even know what that means like a little egg an egglette. So have a look and what we're going to do in distinct Wisconsin sections talk about a secondary article where a journalist went and interviewed a bunch of epidemiologist nutritionist for their opinion about this and that's quite readable and fun and I think it'll create an interesting discussion. So it'll be an article a short like few page article off the air.  Internet about this primary piece of Science and I want you to also see how the journalism process take science grinds it up and spits it out. And then sometimes it's incredibly useful since it's incredibly on you spell cuz when this paper, you might've remember was suddenly in the news on CNN one for girl becomes black and white when it gets journalized. And so this article you're going to look at increase gushing actually said it takes it back in the interview a bunch of you know, hardcore nutritional scientist epidemiologist cardiologist and ask them what their feelings or opinions are about this. He's our expert opinions. Not just you emotion-based and then you will know something about it when your friends in the cafeteria go should I eat eggs funny? You should ask that first have a look at these young study that may be all legit and such. Okay, we're Square involved in a bold experiment the text question. Is he  Be working pretty well.  Would you please turn the volume up? How did I get a text free? I didn't I shouldn't be I shouldn't have that open. I should have to remove for my phone. But I love those the X's anyways, so I'm supposed to get these from Mom from Mom. Okay, turn the volume up. Here we go forward that to me.  Awesome, it works. It's so Melissa is our texts Master General. So she just proved it works and you got a good feet for Sun Tan City near the door helps with the Verizon in but not okay for online and it's actually this filtration helps cuz everything's temper there to that. It's a little louder, isn't it? Feel like the whole? Okay. So angry so we were we were we were finishing what we're talking about with the digestion and then we're going to go in to talk about metabolism. And so to me the metabolism is is a lot of it is review. I hope but we will go over or what. I'm hoping, you know and we'll find out a few things because when you start thinking about metabolism in terms of nutrition and whole body Phenom, it's very interesting and it's really sort of why is worthwhile to take 102 in those courses because you can really think in deep and interesting ways about metabolism, but we were we were stopped at the colon. So we were discussing the colon like everyone.  When does an. So I wanted to hear we finish that up. So the colon has several incredibly important functions. Most of the absorption of nutrients come from the small intestine not shocking cuz it's incredibly login as a huge amount of surface area and it has a number of different features and functions and structures that help absorb material so that Colin has three sections and the ascending transverse and descending colon and then the rectum and anus to to control release of solid matter connective tissue fiber. And so the main functions are absorbing some of the water about 30% of the water reabsorbing ions, sodium potassium serving ingested ions solidifying Mass including connective tissue fiber bacteria and feces is full of bacteria and actually turns out this is an incredibly valuable source for analysis for the microbiome it is, you know, literally  Microbiome researchers on The Cutting Edge of this new feel that are shitkickers, but they do it at the level of PCR and so it's great. It's actually an incredibly straightforward way to understand the microbiome and then the end of microbiome has a number of functions. I'm going to focus on that little as the GI tract is the home of hundreds of microbial species. Mostly doctor. There are some viruses in the intestinal microbiome is a very complex ecosystem and it will be centuries probably before we fully understand it. But already what we know about the the microbial ecosystem. It is an amazingly important Tournament of a phenotype of mood of obesity of calorie harvesting a propensity to disease is it is incredibly rich and dance field of biology and environmental science just a really interested in some of the leaders in microbiome are here at UCSD. So it's a really exciting place to be involved in.  Kind of research and it just it's one of those things that impacts any any organism by the microbiome and its impacts in ways. We had thought possible is really important. So now the colon is the hero of modern science is supposed that the back side and so I need the number of organisms is about a hundred trillion microbial cell. So the number of your number of genomes that we Harbor is just astonishing and if you think about it microbiology or molecular biology crew out of manipulating microorganisms and manipulating bacteria, so the idea exists that we could even maybe take recombinant Lee altered microbes and see the microbiome of those to do really interesting things. That's just the incredible feel incredible feel and maybe some of you will go into a mini of you will it will impact on your work you do as as Physicians and maybe scientist do so, it's cool. So this is sort of a picture of the integrated absorption.  Tracking one of the problems with this very good text book. Is it sometimes sometimes sacrifices informational Clarity for graphical beauty is a very lovely picture but the words are incredibly tiny. So I just extracted them and got rid of the cool looking picture. But so basically this is the integrated functions of the GI tract and this is actually really worth knowing you have one and also you're probably going to deal with clients patients people or research implements that our research situations where you want to know the size of the stomach absorbs about 20% of the alcohol in some water and I love the stomach's really not in the business of much absorption. It's mostly about processing creating a certain time and grinding everything up small intestines really were a lot of it happens is 70 to 90% of the water most of the alcohol you drink bile acids to get reabsorbed vitamins fats amino acids glucose a lot of good stuff.  And I showed you that beautiful structures in Vilnius.  You know, the Villas has the end of these beautiful epithelial cells here that you know are asymmetrical and they release things and they also take up stuff and then you have this capillary bed a single capillary here and a single luteal. So you have a luteal which is a single branch of the lymph system and the capillary here after Larry and so there's this is really beautiful convergence of surface area and absorption into the liquid streams. Okay, so that's cool and then a large intestines involving sodium-potassium reuptake some fatty acids. Some vitamins are made by the micro. So one of the things of microbiome does it make stuff that we can't make good and bad gases are produced and water is reabsorbed and I guess certain gases are absorbed. I don't quite know what that means when you think about the flow of nutrients the intestines job is  If you don't eat the entire GI tract job is to prepare molecules in and release them into the bloodstream in the lymph system. So this is again one of these graphically almost ridiculously complex pictures and this most of this you covered in physiology, you know, the capillary beds in the cardiovascular system, but the real business end is is this part here. Let me I knew that use for this the right here is where we want to focus on. So let's do that because what's really interesting about the gastrointestinal system is the all of the blood is delivered from the from the gastrointestinal system first directly to deliver by the hepatic portal vein. So it's called in vain because it's deoxygenated blood that has already been through a tissue bad in this case the GI tract and then delivered to the liver. So it's very nutrient-rich because all the nutrients that enter these little capillary beds bundle up.  What are delivered to the liver and then there's also a continue this using the spotlight. There's also a set of lymph ducts are lymph vessels that are produced by the fight. These Lucio's near like a buckeye Country Road be coming up main thoroughfare becoming a highway becoming an interstate, you know to be a lymph vessel. And when school is that the mostly water soluble things end up in the portal vein and the lipids and we'll talk more about this return but lipids just as a kind of particle called a chylomicron. That's at lipoprotein not going to talk about that right now end up being a dare go into the bloodstream and then they are mixed. So you have two completely different modes of absorption of lipids for the luteal. I say remember in the bloodstream is the water-soluble Stockton a city important thing about this in the hepatic portal vein is super important because it needs it every single thing that we absorb in our intestines is water soluble.  End of the liver first. So it's not a surprise that delivers the place where all the enzymes that detoxify detoxify dangerous substances. Are there some one of the main functions of the liver that you maybe you've never heard about is it's full of these enzymes call the cytochrome p450 cytochrome p450 Zumiez enzymes are called Next fashion oxidases that use nadph our old friend that reduce the sodium borohydride of the South to to help hydroxyl 8 different drugs and start detoxified them in one of the things that people who study Pharmacy are really concerned about one of the things that drug companies are really concerned about is what is the effect of ingesting an oral drug you still do you know, what we want is drugs that can be ingested orally cuz that's so easy that are easy to Market their easy to take the reason to prescribe. But the first thing that happens if those drugs pasta deliver if they're water soluble, okay, and and and sometimes you get  Call the first pass effect where the effect is that the drug ends up in the liver first with things can happen to it. So that the pattern portal vein is super important in terms of the Absurd.  You just said it. Yeah, babe in fattic system is more lipids. And if the portal vein is is water-soluble substances. And so one interesting question is what about fat-soluble times? Where did they go and I think they actually sending them depends on how they partition so that that's the basic units of this is the way that works. Okay. So this is just a remind you of that structure. I mean this isn't much better than my little picture. But yeah, you have each villus as a capillary and  bad black TR  still limping a mnemonic is LR4 lifted. Okay. So I meant so you have this massive number of these things that all conglomerate into into flow. Okay. So this is how that works. And so with a very important part of the paddock portal vein is all the glucose that you absorb first ends up in the liver also, so the liver has first shot at, you know, producing glycogen or you know, that work storing that that material is glycogen as well. So so now the small intestine large intestine  Exit ports but there's accessory organs that are absolutely critical to the functioning of the GI tract and these things function in terms of digestion to produce substances that are needed for the correct processing of the food. So the main ones are the pancreatic the pancreas the bile duct and the liver. Okay, and what school will talk at the end of this section that these are are basically reagent storage apparatus is that release the reagents that you need to make the the gut process work? Well, so the pancreas and you probably know the pancreas is his Fame for insulin and glucagon and somatostatin if you're extremely aware of these things, but the insulin and glucagon are the main things you probably heard about in terms of the pancreas at least in Biochemistry and controlling, you know metabolism and we'll talk about that. But the pancreas is a very large organ the alpha and beta cells that produce glucagon.  Insulin, there's a very tiny part of the total pancreas has about four or five in long and its main function is releasing fluids and bicarb bicarbonate to neutralize the acid that comes from the stomach. So super important. The pancreas is very important and along with that. There is a bile tag all the gallbladder which stores bile is produced by the liver and bile is also mixed and there's actually a sphincter here that controls the the the release of pancreatic juice and bile into here and so you might the pancreatic juice the main function of it. It has some other enzymes with the main function is to neutralize acid that makes sense cuz the pH of the stomach kind is like 1 or lower. It can be very acidic and it's very bad for the intestine also the intestinal enzymes function at a neutral pH. So so the pancreas pancreas is helping neutralizes flow of chyme. It's a few teaspoons at a time.  And the Bayou is actually beautiful a molecular material. But first I want a piece of the basic functions is the salivary glands are also included in accessory organs and they secrete mucus and amylase and lysozyme like we talked about the liver produces bile for fat reduction in the stores glycogen and lipids and it's warming up take thing and detoxify. So those are function of the GI tract. The gallbladder is actually storing the bile that deliver makes and it's secretes it through this disk common duct between the the pancreas and the gallbladder in the pancreas produces at by curbing bicarbonate and hydrolases. These are things that hydrolyze different enzymes amylase. Trypsin chymotrypsin agenda trypsinogen when you see Jen when you see a Jen so if you have an enzyme that says Jen after it that means it is a precursor that has to be processed to activity and a lot of protease has are proteins in heaven.  Person that has to be clipped by the produce itself to activate that produce his actions when you see something I kind of trypsinogen or pepsinogen that's a precursor a polypeptide. It needs to be Cleve usually by the protease of interest in order to activate. That's a very common biochemical term. If you didn't know now, you know, it has a number of different enzymes that help digestion as well as bicarbonate. Okay, so that I want to go back to bile salts. So these bile salts bile salts or actually amazing beautiful molecules. And if you don't have to be a chemist to look at it and see if there's that shape of cholesterol steroid carbon skeleton and famous chicken wire shape that all steroids have and the synthesis of these are amazingly interesting. What school is bile acids are basically a carboxyl  Acid version of a sterile up in this case of version of cholesterol. That's why they're called kolac glycolic acid and Taro colic acid and then attached to them are negatively charged groups. And so what these things are as nothing more than detergents are really great detergents are amphipathic molecules. So when and hates water when and loves water so they form these beautiful myself and detergents and this is kind of amusing, you know, Red Bull has in it a substance called taurine. I don't know if you know this or not, but the reason is called Red Bull is because taurine Taurus is the is a is it needs a root? That means ball and taurine is a non canonical molecule. It's it's synthesized guy you Kaku in jail, so you can synthesize it that looks like this it has sulfur in it and it's charged it sort of a non canonical amino acid or sulfuric acid and it is a part of the story.  Folic acid it's just for some reason that's one of the bile acids and there's actually a number of different bile acids, but I'm at 80% of violate are these are these bile salts and bile salts are just great detergent. So they are secreted into the intestine to help stabilize fats to help deliver them to to to us. So that's that's what that's about.  So this is a little bit of a joke. The GI tract is secretive. It's actually secretive. I am and so on this is just actually a little list of these things that are secreted and the amazing thing is if you add up all the volume, it's about almost 2 gallons a day. So we're producing a lot of liquid that we secrete in a lot of three of swords and this is just sort of a collection of these things that we have mouth saliva. We have mucus which is you know, they're these proteins called mucopolysaccharides. They're covered with glyco ladies and they have really good properties for lubrication and and and moisture moisturizing. It's used in all sorts of different different tissues. We've enzymes that are secreted in these are the different tissues do it acid is secreted by the stomach bile is secreted. It's made in the gallbladder and cigar stores in the gallbladder and secreted by carbon.  Is produced by the pancreas and small intestine and their number of hormones that are produced. So there's a whole lot of secretion. Basically, it's like one of those industrial processes where you have some some material. I like a washing machine and you have to water the detergent in the Whitener and all this stuff and I'll mixes up it's incredible incredible process is just amazing makes when I eat now, I just feel more important. How do you regulate all this so I can get you noticed that there's all these things that happened in time just like when you're washing machines on, you know, you have to wait and then it lets the clothes and it has a little charge it and it waits dozen in a trench is it so there's a high time dependency here and turns out that the regulation of these actions including movement as well as secretion occur through two basic mileage is the nervous system and the GI tract now you probably all know the nervous system symptoms of the involved because if you get nervous your stomach  Flights into if you if you eat something that delicious you'll feel different. You know, there's a lot of it across communication between the gut in the nervous system and some of this is very noticeable. Nate. Okay, but there's also the GI tract regulates Itself by producing various substances as well as the GI tract neural network as well. So the neurological approach the way people explored. This is simply you can cut nerves of test animals animals are which GI function not working for a long time people thought that this was the only way that the GI tract is regulated through neural input make some sense and I wouldn't neurons about information processing are behaviors make us eat. So the brain knows we're eating makes a lot of sense. It turns out that the GI tract actually produces a substantial number of of hormones and autocrine molecules that control the action of the gut and this is actually where Endocrinology first emerge.  So this is actually classic experiments are some experiments. I've noticed a reading this nutrition letters are some of the amazingly simple and the dawn of Endocrinology was the discovery of a molecule called secretin secretin.  Not secretive itsy Cretin Cretin. This scene is going to be the death of me. I hate this I don't like you very first hormone ever discovered and it was discovered by a pair of guys called Bayless and Starling they were in their early nineteen-hundreds Starling is actually the same Starling at the Frank Starling principle of heart contractility. That's the same dude very very successful scientist, Nobel Prize, but they listen to figure and Physiology in the early nineteen-hundreds a very important scientist. But anyways in 1900, it was known that if you injected hydrochloric acid into the intestinal Lumen like you feeding tube, you would get production of pancreatic Express by pancreas the pancreas or discrete bicarbonate and it's enzymes to the pancreas and be activated to secrete bunch of fluid.  Measure and so an injection into the blood doesn't do that. So it's something about the intestine being stimulated or something happening in the intestine itself. So, like I said, the original thought was it must be dinner on Saturday dinner Vader the intestine and found it that still works fine. If you give hydrochloric acid intestine the pancreas respond by secreting something and they knew that you could put away from where the pancreas the pancreas is not directly connected to the intestine. So there was some kind of communication going on. And so did you realize it when I what and so they took intestinal tissue and chopped it up or grounded up in sand with acid or non-acetone when they grounded up with acid if filtrated that when added back to an intestine cause the pancreas to release substances it could it could cause it to to to function and so they realize that there was a material being made.  Private intestine that causes the pancreas to respond by releasing its its contents or soliciting copious pancreatic secretions. So what chemical secretin the name this messenger hormones. This is where the term hormone came from is this classic experiment of gut communication with the pancreas who really was the birth of a tire field of biology know so it's the first time anyone realize it organs communicate with each other chemically, so this is a major in biology because we understand communication between tissues even between different parts of cells as it's a blizzard of information being processed all the time. And this is the sort of very first indication of that so kind of cool and there's a bunch of hormones of digestion. In fact this list I chopped off the bottom cuz the bottom has a bunch of other things and there's no doubt that these hormones of the guitar are still  Discover there's a bunch that there's just a lot of stuff going on with the gut and there's really important ramifications to this kind of thing. But so Gap there's there's three. I want to know about call gastrin cholecystokinin and secretin secretin is produced is stimulated by acid jazz and kind and it causes the release of pancreatic bicarbonate another substance from pancreas cholecystokinin is made by the small intense in in response to dietary fat and it causes the release of pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder. So cholecystokinin is sort of a lipid signal or is it? Hey, there's lipids and it's it's stimulated or released by by high lipid content in the car. I'm and gastrin is produced by the stomach into the duodenum denim in response to food or even thinking about food. So this is if someone is given like a delicious Center season image of Food they'll start releasing cholecystokinin to this idea.  Your stomach is responding to inputs is perfectly reasonable. It actually happens. And so this triggers of stomach to release HCL and pepsinogen stimulates gastric and intestinal motility. So please kind of hormones are absolutely amazing that both respond when the gut is empty to tell us to eat more and are released. There's other ones that are released when we're old and tell us to stop eating. So these are very interesting hormones that alter Behavior drastically. I'll tell you one other thing about digestion. It's really amazing. It's one of those things. It's a question not an answer is there's a there's a type of gas for you all heard of a gastric bypass which is sort of a you know, a surgical Resort for people who are hookah store too much fat terrible problems with weight control a try alter to die atzen. So after a certain set of criteria, people are candidates for gastric bypass in it can help people enormously. It depends on you know, a lot of situations, but there's a  the one called roux-en-y roux  And why and it has to do with your friends term it has to do with the the way it basically begin testing is rerouted in a part of its just maybe they basically make a y structure are part of the intestine is just not anymore in receiving Chi Minh and absorbing so it's a way to sort of Short Circuit the intestine and the amazing thing about ruin y as you might expect if you're absorbing let you know input of calories in an easier weight-loss, but one of the crazy things about roux-en-y procedure is within a couple weeks way before weight changes happen at all. There's drastic changes in the type 2 diabetes that these obese people have so they're busy ology is drastically altered immediately buy a surgery that really would be just about short-circuiting and that's definitely has something to do with hormones. Maybe it has something to do with with microbiome. No one quite sure how ruined why causes is drastic Sudden Change in metabolic signaling bits, of course, incredibly interesting.  That's that's that's one of the important outcomes is changing diabetic and pathological outcomes. Okay. Now we're going to switch gears and talk about metabolism. And you know all this is just a reminder that it's a lot and we have a we have been over it a 10 102 don't worries and you don't have to write and go do I have to do all this? We are Masters at picking out the parts and then Krebs cycle. We're going to pick out. This is the name of the game little bit of metabolism. And you know, this is near and dear because I teach 102 and I know you've all had 102 and basically what I want to do is remind you of someone or two things that you should have familiarity with. This is not a 102 class. I'm not going to say draw the reactions of beta oxidation. We're not going to do any of that but you have to have a fool in vocabulary and understanding this because  The ways that nutrition and Metabolism in her player a number of them. I want to go over some of them so we'll talk about it. So just a few terms that you remember that that the sort of push and pull up metabolism is anabolism and catabolism catabolism. You may recall that the breaking down of molecules for small parts in energy and anabolism is using that energy to build things that are bigger tissues storage molecules that kind of thing and actually I buy the book cuz right here at said energy using or energy usage energy production, but this is much more than energy usage uses the energy to build things since I can't abide like steroids promote an embolism in and growth of tissue. So, you know, I remove that I was misleading but this is the basic ideas is you have big molecules being made from small parts using energy or big molecules being broken down into small parts to make energy.  Capitalism and you are catabolic processes by glycolysis use of anabolic process used by gluconeogenesis. We're going to go over some of that. Okay, you all know that the universal molecule universal currency of metabolism is ATP like it's all about catabolism is all about not only producing little Parts but ATP and keeping ATP at a at a constant level in tissues like the muscle in you know, if you took one away with me we're obsessed with ATP production. It's really all about maintaining ATP production in the face of I'm stressing you and nutrition. It's all the orgasms, you know, every if you stop making ATP you are not long for this world. The reason it's cyanide is so poisonous is because it immediately shuts down most ATP synthesis in the body in the results of it or catastrophic an instant instant 80 pieces.  Fox fur the fur. Do you know RNA? It's it's it's an has his beautiful set of three very antsy phosphate. So don't like being in a tight group. They're really really good leaving groups. They leave the tablet. And basically the the name of the game is making ATP and then breaking it down as you need an HEB has his beautiful $20 bill of the cell meaning like you can buy almost anything with the $20 bill, but if you bring a hundred dollar bill into a coffee cart, you might make people concerns or ATP is just the right size currency to do a lot of things and not get a lot of wasteful change. If you're like me if you break a bill of the change disappears very quickly. So this is energy released by hydrolysis of this is energy released in catabolic Pathways helps produce ATP and ATP hydrolysis gives up energy in this about adding phosphate the things that we could lead a group.  About using phosphate to drive things upgraded. This is all old hat. And we're going to use this as we need it in case of the standard ideas. And now we've talked a bit about there's macronutrients and micronutrients and you've actually talked a lot about the macronutrients. You took about carbohydrate you talk about stats. In fact about protein in chicken. Carbohydrate metabolism, you've talked about further oxidation of it and they have crabs in electron transport chain, you've talked about proteins you'll be deaminated on we're going to go over I'm going to review all that for you just so we're all on the same page. We haven't talked so much about alcohol, but that's another great source of energy with certain costs certain expenses to the body as well as the wallet and and then there's fat and I'll have you know, when you've talked about all of these. So before we go any further, I want to actually use the clickers to find out where we stand on this.  Where do we stand so we're going to do some cooking? Okay?  Maybe  Ready here. I can even like put the lights on so no one will copy. Okay ready? First one mammals can make glucose from fatty acids.  Yes, no don't know and it's okay. If you don't know repetition is the parent of learning.  Mammals can make glucose from fatty acids.  Yes, no, no, no.  Let's see where we stand 334 good soul.  okay, let me  all right.  Alright, this is useful.  I'll stop.  Most of you know something the answer actually is no so of majority of you know that you can't make glucose from fatty acids and I actually have a really nice way. I think to show this i t a i have a few quarters ago made this point to this is when we good way to know it. It's actually very hard to understand its own level, but we will make it clear. He lets go a little further.  Mammals can make fatty acids from glucose. Yes. No, I don't know.  Mammals can make fatty acid from glucose. Yes. No, no, no.  Okay. Hurry up. You you fat makers.  police  Okay. They're interested me. Most of you know, that that is true. You can make fat from gloomy probably overheard that cuz you consume too much sugar cause cultural thing as well. That's true. You can make fatty acid from glucose. So a substantial number of you know, this we're all in the right place though. I guess there's a couple people clicking D&A what those are the rebels think different? Okay, so mammals can make glucose from some amino acids. Yes or no to know.  Animals can make glucose from some fatty acids.  The numbers are going wild.  I guess I see your percentage chart here and going wild.  Okay.  Okay.  Ready?  And the answer is yes. So most of you know this I don't have to lecture that now I'm getting so yes, we're going to go over that. This is a really interesting interface. Okay, and there's actually a pretty simple rule of thumb for figuring out who can make what it's not nearly as Arcane or Byzantine as you might think so we will we will parse that out.  In one or two, we went over symphysis and consumption of Ketone bodies. I'm simply I'm pulling you guys Randy Hampton approves of this poll. So, let's see how many of you are comfortable with the Ketone body thing. We went over synthesis and consumption of ketones.  What are comfortable?  How many of you heard of them?  You went over them?  All right.  Going to stop now.  Most of you won't remember remember going over synthesis. Don't remember. That's okay. You were in the right place cuz the Ketone bodies are extremely interesting both in pathophysiology. But also just physiology is now becoming clear the Ketone bodies are a natural part of metabolism. They're not just something that happens when people are fulminant diabetic you probably were taught in your physiology cause about ketoacidosis and that it's this papal other to stay but Ketone bodies are actually a wonderful evolutionary adaptation to dealing with low availability of carbohydrates, and and now they're athletes and other people dieting in this situation where they try to make themselves go into that state and we'll talk about that. It's real interesting but it's all completely routed in mainstream metabolism. Okay, one more. I promise. I will take a look at the Zhong egg study you mentioned  Paradise out there, okay.  There we go.  This is our.  I really don't have a lot of choice but that's a useful phrase. I don't make promises. I can't break. It's from a blues song actually, but it's a good idea.  Okay.  I see that many of you. Many of you were well-intentioned many of you are willing to look at their jeonguk study and most of you some of your honest whatever just have a look at it, you know because this is where these kinds of scientific controversies come from it's actually worth having a look and I think one of the difficulties in large service classes as you don't get enough exposed to the scientific literature, when you see this paper, you'll see how it's a daunting challenge. It is a very complex statistics number of people involved in studies. It also will allow us to apply that vocabulary learned about you know, longitudinal prospective retrospective and prospective cross-section in a way that actually is real. I think that's valuable. Okay. So we're done with their Kong egg study. Okay, and then there's a few questions here. It seems to be working. Well, Melissa is all well.  Awesome. Okay isn't cholesterol essential in what situation if you become so cholesterol is good too much bad. So this is amount. This is a quality or something like that if there's a sweet spot for cholesterol and then to make it even more interesting. We synthesize a bunch of it and we consume a bunch of it. So there's two different modes going on and we'll talk a bit about that this really a beautiful biology of a type of particles called lipoprotein is that will go into that are really interesting and have to do with that. They would you please raise the volume I did. Okay. Why does alcohol reach your bloodstream faster if your stomach is empty cuz you drinking more. Well, I bet probably it probably is as simple as that when you are eating a meal your diluting alcohol into a bolus of time and you're releasing  More slowly. I mean, I know I don't know if that's actually true or whether that's barlour. I'm not totally sure if that's true. Then why can we survive without a dear friend of mine got his gallbladder removed and the answer is he's not the only way you absorbed lipids. It's just a really efficient way like it be important thing and it's one of the frustrating things in biology and biochemistry and in sports for sure sports science. Is there very few toggle switches in a very few cases where you have a yes or no, you have more and less. So it makes him you can survive without a gallbladder. One of the things people. Gallbladders do is they are a bit more careful about the amount of fat they eat in the diets to eat and also they can with each individual has different abilities to withstand certain diet. So my friend who is missing his gallbladder eats. I had a milkshake with them in a lot of lipid doesn't seem to bother him. So, you know, it's in there is a lot with individuals to okay.  I know you like books a great book. I just read was about the microbiomes interaction of the brain is called the gut-brain connection. All that sounds cool promise you at least look at it.  Whatever I said that sounds cool. There's actually a number of really neat books on the microbiome. They've come out and they're there their racks. And also if you want there's there's a guy we have a one of the top people in microbiome in the world is I'll put it right here is named Rob Knight.  Kiesza a researcher at a faculty member in the medical school and that he has set up a microbiome Consortium. So you can actually be part of his many thousands of persons are databank to have your microbiome analyzed and he hasn't Ted talk with I think like 5 million views. It's really very if you want to learn get a quick dose of microbiome from someone who really is an expert. Just watch his Ted Talk in 20 minutes saturation. It's interesting and really cool and it'll start to give you a sense of how important this all this so I want to just go over some some some metabolism that I'm hoping you at least are acculturated with remember I told you that culture is what's left when you forget an entire education. So I think you've been 102 alterated and I we're going to just dredge up some of that the good thing about the acculturation. This is sort of like Footprints in a Minefield, you know, where to walk and so, you know, because you've been incarcerated  I will come back to you and you know, the there's a massive amount of good metabolism on the internet. You have to be a little choosy but a lot of its good and so I just want to go over some familiar Pathways and then talked a bit about how nutrition plays a role in how they operate and how they interact. Okay, and I think we'll be fine soap. First of all these terms that you'll hear a lot is Central carbon metabolism here in the terms Corral Central.  Carmen like my cat metabolism.  After that one away party, he thinks he's like the Sultan of Kiddieland because he got like a hundred visitors in little groups of 5 and 10 cuz we keep him in in a room sweet home to get out and you just had these like there's audiences in the whole party like who carbon and it got to the point of light over there when you get up on the bed.  And now it's like we're all those cool people like they're not coming back. I need my subjects amazing cat is basically just the main Pathways were carbon-containing molecules, like glucose and fatty acids are metabolized are constructed Dinettes, you know, that's part of metabolism, but there's much much much secondary metabolism that is you know, much more low abundant molecules that can be very important but Central carbon taoism is mainstay Central carbon metabolism is glycolysis father by pyruvate dehydrogenase followed by feeding as a c Toco a groups into the Krebs cycle followed by reducing equivalents of nadh going into the electron transport chain jumping those electrons on  Water and CO2 being produced and I hope that's at least comfortable in this is not about you memorizing not the molecular structures. But some basic ones like the structure of pyruvate structure of oxaloacetate are very useful to have in hand the structure of alpha ketoglutarate, but we will I will make sure to tell you exactly what I want you to know and if you remember from when to when you met many of you do not have you want to do I'm really not about you pulling structures out of the you know out of The Ether if I I want you to if you hear a name be able to know what it looks like if you see a structure you should be able to name it but we're not going to be heavy on molecular structures. This class is not about detailed organic chemistry. It's about using that stuff to understand the flow of nutrients in control of a bodily processes and how nutrition impacts on them. So, you know fear not don't be afraid.  Like that graphic and this is one of the trouble is a hundred million ways to represent glucose glycolysis Krebs electron transport chain classic biochemistry book called biochemistry and what I want you to know, this is just a couple familiar players here that says nadh is you don't have to be ametabolous to know that nadh blooms large and Metabolism like by the end of the 102 course, you've seen nadh like a million times. If she didn't the Krebs cycle being generated you seen it entering the electron transport chain to deliver those electrons. You probably know that any DH is a reduced form of a molecule and basically what nadh and they usually drawn with another hydrogen is this is a source of electric OK and NAD  NAD is the oxidized form and basically one way to view it has two electrons plus it for a time or you can look at it as an H minus a hydride plus a proton either way you like is there just Waze makes this reduce from so this is the reduced form and this is the oxidized form and this is beautiful structures of the business and that we will talk about it take to hide riding in make a structure. That's this is all review but the important thing is nadh is an electron carrier and it often is involved in oxidation reactions were these electrons are removed from carbon skeletons in the course of oxidizing them to make to get energy. So that's why I want you to see NAD is all over the place here. And you know, there's a tpr friend. There's a c look away completely classic molecules of pyruvate. Okay. So this is what I'm hoping. This is at least a flicker I do.  Understand that after this course a few months later it all vaporizes for most people I get that. So this is why I'm taking the time to go over to bed again. Okay, another familiar pathway. I'm hoping is beta oxidation. You notice I even made a betta here. Okay. So this is how how focused. I am. I made it back and then everything I typed after was Greek. I had to like change it back but beta oxidation. Is this pathway by which fatty acids are oxidized to carbon as it is time to make acetylcholinesterase. So is he look away is super super. I mean, I don't like putting on the terms. This is a little silly cuz you know, it's something you've probably mentioned a million times and along with that. Disco a s h this is the under of a ties for him. And you know, that koay is a carrier of a soul groups of lipids that you know fatty acyl groups as well.  Acetyl groups and I'm hoping that if that's not familiar now it is repetition is the parent of learning. So if you had to hear it now for the end of time, let N be the one where you learned it's okay. And so in the cell you have oxidation of fatty acids. It happens in the inside the mitochondria mitochondria in Central and you have this beautiful molecule carnitine that carries the fatty acids into it and you may know the carnitine is a rate-limiting the carnitine transfer reaction is the rate-limiting step for fatty acid oxidation and it's not a coincidence in people sell carnitine as a supplement for people to take with the Hopedale booster fatty acid oxidation. There is very little evidence that that helps but it makes good biochemical sent and for a while I was even taking carnitine but I think it's just cuz I thought it was cool. I don't think it really did anything. Okay. So this is another and you end up with beta oxidation making acetylcholine. You also end up making nadh and fadh2.  And remember another another molecule that Loom large and metabolism is f a d f a d is another one of these reducing or oxidizing Paris ofad when it takes two electrons into H+. Has it become fadh2. And again, this is the which form is this one?  Shout it out. Somebody I like that you're showering don't show to me and this is the oxidized form and moving them somewhere else or removing them from a carbon. Skeleton. That's new. That's an old hat metabolism. Okay, and then another one has its own metabolic pathway. I don't know about the other one or two professors, but I did not make everyone learn all the catabolic and anabolic Pathways for me no asses they all exist, understood but it's a lot a lot a lot a lot of memorization and more important to me is understanding where to find out about these things when you need them and also understanding the basic principles in the basic amino acids in again, if you know this this may be old hat I trained with my running group this morning. So my knee is a little mad at me. So that's why I'm hobbling around get this I got a call from  Kaiser they want to talk to me about Medicare that so there you go. Grandfather's like that's what I call anybody wants. Hey, you're getting really old. Give us a call. Alright, so the main thing about amino acids. Okay, in fact  you all know this your tomorrow's leaders and molecular biology and biomedical Sciences. This is the generic amino acid structure.  And the main thing for metabolism of them as you have this nitrogen and once you remove this nitrogen, you basically have some carbon very molecule that can be metabolized or use your bed made other things and so main transition is removal of this nitrogen in its metabolism. As I say, I'm thinking this is is is pretty familiar. So this is happening or so, basically the stumbling block for using amino acids in metabolism is dealing with that nitrogen. And so there are number of reactions that allow the nitrogen be removed and you end up with the carbon skeleton and the interesting about that is amino acids each amino acid.  Has a cognate Alpha keto acid.  This is something I'd run in a lot in my class. And if you haven't heard it if it's okay is if you remove the nitrogen through the rules of organic chemistry, using oxidation and and hydrolysis you end up with what's called an alpha keto acid to Ketone group replacing is nitrogen and that's completely standard organic chemistry. And that is based at the heart of metabolism both synthesis and degradation of amino acids is doing that with talked about a couple of those and then the nitrogen that's produced can either be used in metabolism. But most of it goes through the urea cycle OKC of urea cycle and then the carbon skeletons are often metabolize some way in the Krebs cycle. And so this is again, I'm hoping this is if not, you know something you think about every morning at breakfast at least something that has a familiar ring to it. Now that we're going over to cat set the case is a sort of Vaguely Familiar. Good Austin, okay.  These guys learned a lot like there's a lot if you go that metabolic pathways Charter, it's pretty much most of it. You know, I'm earning my wage, but you are earning your tuition money to that seem more important part to know. It's like learning a lot of pretty cool. So let's let's bore a little bit deeper into this amino acid thing is what ends up happening to you sort of thing that has to happen to use these beautiful amino acids in metabolism is you have to remove the nitrogen group and that happens through a set of reactions called transamination reactions. And so this way this is a completely generic transamination reaction. This is very familiar to you organic chemistry students, cuz you're giving some kind of group and then a crapload of ours with numbers dangling off of it that you're supposed to ignore. That's how you do organic chemistry. I don't think that's changed much and so here is a molecule is amino acids. So this is the r group of some sort. There's the amino. There's Ian mean  And there's the the carboxylic acid and a transamination reaction just involves removing this molecule to a ketone position and that becoming a Chi town in that if that seems bizarre to you that actually makes very good chemical sense. Cuz Amino Amino groups are ammonia will it react with a ketone group to form is called a shift base and then the shift base can be reduced into an ammeter. So it actually makes organic chemical sense. Then if you want to ask me about that and office hours for go back to your old chem notes or look it up. It makes a lot of sense. So assertive intermediate that makes sense in in this kind of things, Chef base.  And I don't care if you know that or not, but it might be useful. If you find this confusing some people just memorize that you can convert an amino group into a keto and a taquito. Can you give her a new amino group that's basically was found but there is an organic chemical principle really into it ever supposed to some weird conversion between an n in and out. All right, sissy basic transamination reaction very generic. And so maybe that's a very important when that happens. All the time is the moving of an amino group and something alanine to Alpha ketoglutarate to make glutamate in one of the things that you may have learned in your in your metabolism class. Is it many many amino acids dump their nitrogen onto on to Alpha ketoglutarate to make glutamate. So this is a beautiful example of this idea of an amino acid and Alpha Chi a cognate alpha alpha keto acid. Okay, so want you to look at this.  Is there is alanine that's the amino acid and pyruvate is its cognate Alpha keto acid. What do I mean by that Alpha keto acid? So the alpha carbon to a carboxylic acid to one next door to this is the alpha keto acid and every single amino acid has a cognate Alpha keto acid and some of them are pretty Israel like Alpha ketoglutarate the cognate amino acid for that is glutamic acid glutamate and fur pyruvate. The cognate amino acid. That is Alan e number of these and knowing a few of them is very useful. You should know all of these but I will put that I will put that on the on the terms as you don't have to ask and I don't have to tell you now cuz I'm going to put it on the list but a couple of these are used to but anything about this particular reaction with glutamate many different amino acids have their nitrogen dumped on to Alpha ketoglutarate to make glutamate and liberate that Alpha keto acid for metabolism. So this is a sort of a funnel  Action many different amino acids can lose their Amino groups to this particular transamination reaction. Okay, then what happened to the glutamate? And this is a very standard reaction that happens in the liver mostly is that glutamate is oxidized in back to Alpha ketoglutarate and nitrogen is released. Okay. So this is a a major way is amino acids dumping nitrogen to Alpha ketoglutarate to make glutamate nutmeg glue to make its convert it back to Alpha ketoglutarate to liberate nitrogen that enters the urea cycle. So all of metabolites, that's one another very common reaction series that I'm hoping. It's at least vaguely from there is gluconeogenesis. You remember gluconeogenesis is mostly glycolysis running backwards and the Delta G of those reactions and sailor conditions is pretty much zero. It's it's very easy to reverse osmosis reactions and the reactions  All the big energy drops and those all involve doing what are we would call an end-run around those reaction. So we have these bypass reactions and the most important one I'd say for metabolism why I should make a value judgment. The really important ones are the ones down here where we take Alpha ketoglutaric. We take part of it and converted to Alpha ketoglutarate. This is oxxo good right here at the same term and then convert that to defrost we know pyruvate and again if that's not unfamiliar, we will talk more about gluconeogenesis but moving to Genesis is in one of the major ways. We maintain blood glucose after we haven't eaten for a while. And if you sleep like 10 hours of substantial fraction, the glucose in your body is made from from Google neo genesis. If you're a cat like carbon all of the glucose in your body is made by gluconeogenesis. They pretty much constitutive lie make up make gluconeogenic carbon Google neugenic glucose. Okay. I know they're familiar pathways.  Fatty acid synthesis and when I'm just a reviewing all this inside as soon as you remember involves, it happens in the cytosol and it involves acetyl groups being generated in the cytosol and then they got carboxylated. Remember those that now inoko a reaction. This is how you thought I never had.  L&L  call away is the intermediate for fatty acid synthesis. And that's the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis is generating that molecule and that molecule has been used as a building block to add growing a change that are reduced to make fatty acids. And so again, this is if this is unfamiliar to you, you can go back to your notes and as we mentioned it if we mentioned it, well, we'll talk about it. But this is incredibly important this reaction super important for when we consume too much sugar and we start converting it to Fat like this is why that happens there was one of the things that occurs in people who are overloading their their carbohydrate calories and not active enough. Okay. So there's a couple ways that metabolic pathway is there really where all of those macronutrients are converted into energy or storage molecule. So that's clearly one part of it and you kind of know that already but another part where nutrition is super important.  Many of the vitamins and many of the nutrients that are essential but not energy produced. Remember we are signed into energy energy-producing nutrients like carbohydrates fat protein alcohol if you if it's a Friday, okay, and then the other nutrients in tartar are non-energy producing their much lower abundance. He's those are any of those are needed for this metabolic pathways to incur and I know you probably know this but it's quite amazing how many of the essential vitamins are things that directly impact on the function of enzymes. I'm so here's an example. These are just the B vitamins and some of the B vitamins are numbered off and someone I like I found out that niacin is B3 and some of these is biotin B7. No one ever uses the term be 7, but the important point is not the numbers but these are all very familiar molecular structures and you may be a little rusty, but you remember this is thiamine pyrophosphate that involve  Harve de graduates attacking carbonyls. Riboflavin is f a d which is right over there and over this the carbons in these structures are basically the business end of the molecule to do this. Roxy is pyridoxal phosphate. That's absolutely critical for all those transaminations. Remember, it makes an aldehyde that can pick up and then get nitrogen. Okay, nicotinic acid and nadph absolutely critical for most of the oxidation reduction reactions in the cell and you made me realize if you don't have these cofactor so we actually completely grind to a halt if you don't have NAD during glycolysis, you can't do like hollis's so he that's just one example, if you don't have NAD in the Krebs cycle, you can't run the Krebs cycle. So these are super important co-factors used in many cases are TuneIn always involved in all carboxylation including producing this carboxylated conversion of acetyl-coa. So the point is that their home is deeply involved.  In the metabolic pathways in a so there and and a lot of the vitamins that are not mentioned here have a more peripherals but pantothenic acid the special structure alarm for koay, you know, I talked about going to see the fight in pantothenic acid has the sulfur that is literally the business Adam of Coweta. It's the thing that gets you to make C's Ester bonds and let's go all of these nutrients are super important indirect ways. You've actually studied very deeply vitamin B12 is if you remember that starts with his crazy Cobalt containing q a I can have an amazing structure that we'll talk about more and it's involved in certain kinds of covalent reactions that are critical for a number of different transfers of methyl groups and other covalent modification. So it's up and all of these deficiencies are in a very famous very famous diseases that were sort of studied and understood by a black.  Nutrients. Okay. So that's that's sort of the thing. I went backwards. Sorry. So another place where nutritions really interesting here is the interconversion of nutrients. So, you know, when you eat something, you know, one of the things were very good at is converting one thing into another it's anabolic. It's not catabolic and this could be incredibly valuable and Incredibly useful but it also can be really problematic depending on the extent of these. So this is actually really great little chart of the kinds of things. So lippa Genesis has two production of lipids and you can have by Paula sister breakdown of lipids. You can have me on C Toco a candy can be produced from beta oxidation could be used to make lipids. You have these Ketone bodies that we'll talk about it more when we talked about the keto genic diet you have amino acids in her playing with these and start when I talk a little bit about some of these interconversions, but first of all for that Thirty or forty percent of you who click yes, and thank you for your  Nasty kind of anonymous it's okay. You might think why can't you take Sally up and make glucose or fatty acids when you bait oxidizing me to make a Seal Co a you put a sealed into the Krebs cycle. Krebs cycle molecules, like oxaloacetate are used to make glucose. Remember the gluconate? Why doesn't it work and the answer is this is every time you put in a c Toco end of the Krebs cycle.  Buy one turns to CO2 to come out.  So if you wanted to make convert 10 grams of a fatty acid carbon into 10 grams of glucose carbon, you would have to you would never be able to do that because you put each gram you put in a gram comes out of CO2 in terms of both Glau. Here's a simpler way to look at it. The way that you make glucose is you need a three-carbon precursor molecule of pyruvate. It could be glycerol. He could be a carbon skeleton from the from the amino acids. If you look at the Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis you start with oxaloacetate that's four carbons long and gets converted into fostering a pyruvate. You have to go review this if you remember who you need something bigger than two carbons and here's why is if you take acetyl coenzyme this is nothing more than the net reaction of the Krebs cycle. So then Krebs cycle involves all this stuff getting reduced you get one GTP just above the pre-med. You know, this really just want to be certain  Arcane fax the muscle that happens in Krebs like those carbon goes in CO2 comes out and things get reduced. So the trouble is if for every osito Kauai you put in you get a CO2 out there is no way to build a glucose from any of these products. You see that you can't make glucose from CO2 unless you're a plant you can't make glucose from any of these things. So if fatty acids are producing nothing but a see look away and that's how beta oxidation works. You cannot get any net production of carbon molecules to make glucose with this he can't work in this is why you can't use battery acids to make who cooks that would be awesome. If you could cuz we each have about 20 to 30 marathons worth of fatty acid fuel in our tissue and if we can convert it into glucose, it means you could run like, you know, 20 marathons in a row without even fueling would be so awesome. But we just can't do it bacteria can find you I can plants can because they have a very  Nation of the Krebs cycle in which osito koay comes in and sucks and it comes out. It's called the glyoxylate cycle. So they actually have figured out a way to not lose all that carbon in CO2. Okay, so you can make glucose from other nutrients and those this is again one of these annoying charts, but I will blow it out. You can make glucose from amino acids. And this is actually consistent with what I was just telling you is it there is two classes of amino acids your glucogenic amino acids. Meaning they are able to make glucose glucose genic. She now we're getting started and there are ketogenic  amino acids  Now, I don't know if you remember about Ketone bodies, but they're made from acetylcholine. So you can make Ketone bodies from the sea. You can't make glucose from a sweet okole. So the the difference between ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids are where they're of carbon skeletons enter the Krebs cycle. So you have these various my liking these various amino acids it through a catabolic Pathways you can see so these arrows each of these arrows if each of these arrows is a collection of reactions that are specific for that amino acid to break them down. And you know, thank Glory. We don't have to memorize all of them. This is been worked out. But what school is the ones that enter the Krebs cycle?  In any of these larger molecules can be shunted through oxaloacetate to make glucose. So any of the amino acids it end up making products or catabolism that are these bigger kreb cycle molecules are perfectly usable to I steal from the Krebs cycle to make glucose the ones that end up making acetylcholine cannot be used to make glucose. But there's a Sido boys can be used to make Ketone bodies. If you don't remember that you can look up it's a very simple set of reactions. I was just see look away this in Access can be condensed into Ketone bodies. Okay. So you have a glucogenic ketogenic and then both some of them Eno asses go down multiple Pathways it either result in things like a c acetate see look away or they end up making bigger molecules can be used to make glucose getting from there that is used when we talk about the ketogenic diet. It will be good for the liver is really sort of this mediator of metabolism in one of the places. I  About it was this deamination. So all of that fancy taking Amino groups off of of amino acids and dumping them on to Alpha ketoglutarate and then using those Amino groups to to fuel the Krebs cycle. I need a few of the urea cycle all happened in the liver and the kidney is of course involved in removing that urea but the liver has a number of different function side color coded is detoxification do the cytochrome p450. They told you about the liver is loaded with variants of this molecule to degrade dangerous things amino acids and fatty acid metabolism. Urea cycle gluconeogenesis glycogen synthesis and storage in this is probably probably know this from your class. Alcohol metabolism is mostly liver synthesis of bile cholesterol lipids in blood proteins, you know, we are aware of that. So the liver does all these different things that is really started to brain and metabolism will stop here and then we'll continue.  on Tuesday "
