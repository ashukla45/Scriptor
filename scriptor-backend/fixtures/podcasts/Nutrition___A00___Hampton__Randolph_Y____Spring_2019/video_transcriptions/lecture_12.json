I guess the professor before who I know that has happened to me that just seems like the kiss of death for people falling asleep and whatever else so I'm going to keep it if people really would rather have it all night club ecstasy. Whatever. Let me know. I don't mind either way. It's it's nice to see you all too. So I had to leave it bright. Let's see. He's so a couple orders of business the exams are ready. You can pick them up at the exam Depot the me and was 68.5 which is actually pretty typical for one of these large class exams. The highest score was ninety-eight. So someone could get pretty much everyone right? I am always worried if you write a test where no one can do. Well that's truly an unfair test. This is a hard but fair test important thing is that I grade on a curve. So, please don't let the test dominant you're thinking of the material dominate your thinking.  This is my suggestion. Okay, and the standard deviation was 2400 a broad range broad range. I'm going to have a re-grade process of the scribes you next time. I'll put the key up on the have a look at the key. You know, I believe it's your right to demand to regrade is part of the learning process and I'm against any sort of any sort of game playing right eye say we're going to go back through it and find something's wrong. That's basically just saying for unprofessional and don't know how to grade a test correctly. So I have no interest in amplifying that idea. I also think that when people do that, they're just trying to use fear as a way to keep you from getting what you possibly deserve. So I'm against that I'm against that anyway, but I'm not criticizing her judging. I'm just not doing it.  Okay, where use the Bold experiment the text question thing. It's actually been working really well speaking of which.  See if there's no there's one now and our texts Master General has been doing a great job and really appreciate that. It's super fun. And it's a completely risk-free way to ask any question you want without a general Buzz General active alcohol duh. Okay, so I'm speaking about several really interesting questions popped up and I thought I would address some of them because I don't get to every question. Some of them are really worth discussing. I think it's totally awesome to pay here. Lots of all sorts of questions in the truth is I'm not a dietitian or nutritionist. I'm definitely not a physician. So sometimes the questions you ask me. I can't like should I be eating this or that I don't know. You know what I don't want to be telling you stuff. That's just basically not true because I have the ability to speak with remarkable Authority about things. I don't know anything about  Do I have to be careful about that and I don't want to do that. But here's an interesting question if ethanol is a fermentato product what's going on? Why am I not Intoxicated by my microbiome after eating a bowl of salad in fermentation if it is created by fermentation to get how does this alcohol uptake exposure contributed wonderful question. So first of all, you have to realize that the word fermentation is it incredibly broad term fermentation does not always mean making alcohol. It's any sort of bacterial metabolism that involves not using oxygen. Okay, and if you talk to any wine maker or brewmaster, one of the features of the art of making alcoholic beverages is keeping the organisms from do all sorts of other fermentation really general term and ethanol is one of the better products of fermentation, but there's fermentation to make all sorts of things. So when we say,  Gut microbiome fermentation that does not necessarily mean alcohol production.  It is worth mentioning that your gut does produce a small amount of ethanol your gut produces. Methanol your gut produces butanol and propionyl is all kinds of interesting molecules, and I'm not going to go much into this but they're actually was a legal defense in which someone who got in a car accident was able to claim that their gut had producing of ethanol to make them drunk and it wasn't their fault. This is an actual legal case. It just goes to show that legal decisions are about what's most convincing as opposed to what's most true important interesting justification that different so really wonderful question with the important point for us. The science is that fermentation does not necessarily mean ethanol production and the amount of ethanol your gut produces is well within the range of the kinds of molecular ways. You can deal with it. It's not a coincidence that we have enzymes.  That metabolize ethanol into Safe products. Someone also asked is ath really the abbreviation for alka dehydrogenase because they're thinking of antidiuretic hormone. Probably sadly enough both are abbreviated ADH and because alcohol is a diuretic is actually makes a little bit dicey and complicated but we won't ever get in that trouble another good question Pepcid help the flushing of face from acetaldehyde. I got this several times. I looked into it. I guess people drink they carry Pepcid to do this. I didn't know this was a thing. It turns out it is a thing because Pepcid is a Pepcid is a histamine.  histamine H2 receptor  antagonist  one of the ways that your gut produces acid is through histamine 2 receptor stimulation and Pepcid is a drug that you can buy over the counter to block acid secretion through this histamine signaling axis and the flushing that's caused by acetaldehyde is thought 3 through mast cells that produce histamine. So it one model is that it it it's through his histaminergic signaling and decrease. That's at least what I was able to prove it. So it's interesting. I didn't know that was a thing to people carry Pepsi to the bar because more than one person asked that no, that was the thing. Here's another really interesting question. Why is there a genetic aspect alcoholism? For example, if you have an alcoholic in the family or the higher risk of developing alcohol and that's a very complicated question. It's something first of all, it's important to realize it very large-scale studies of Alcoholics.  Have come up with a thought that about 50% of the propensity to become an alcohol is explainable by genetic. So it's not like, you know, it's it's not written in stone. But it is true that alcoholism has a genetic component. It's probably has to do with CNS processing reward Pathways other genes that have very complex interplay with the with the behavioral system. There are also mutants that people have devised in animal models that metabolize alcohol differently and people love the idea that you can explain alcoholism by degrees in metabolism of alcohol that is definitely not the case is much more complicated than that. There is an interesting observations between different subtypes of dopamine receptors and propensity to show addictive behavior. But again, it is just a biased towards higher probability another important feature. Is that parents or alcoholic often have difficulty?  Aldi in parenting in ways that are the most healthy in that can pass through in a manner that's more socio-cultural as opposed to genetic in those are very very hard things to unravel, you know a good example as if you didn't know anything about genetics you might think that speaking a certain language is genetics cuz it nap so perfectly well to offspring and their parents but it has nothing to do with that. Okay. So that's that's sort of silly example of the same complex station to Super interesting question. But like many of the most interesting questions, it remains interesting because it's a question. I mean, I know that you guys are in the business you are professionals it taking questions and converting them into tight answers to get full credit. And that's a great thing to know how to do as an undergraduate. But the truth is you're all moving towards the place where you will be professionals are devising questions as opposed to answering delivering answers. And so this is probably another this is a very active field of Investigation is are their addiction and alcoholism jeans to what extent of those overlap.  What kind of membrane systems are involved how definite is it? You know he's important question really good stuff. We talked about alcohol with hard to talk about how we're sorry, but something uplifting an excellent vitamins like the opposite and I'm kidding. Of course if you can drink you should and if you can't but vitamins are important part of nutrition. You don't have to be an expert in nutrition. This may be the first word if he said you're tripping maybe that half the people in the world are go vitamins. If you ask for an award Association and it turns out there's a lot to think about in vitamins and nutrition in and what's cool about these lectures at that Nigel first put together that I'm sort of modify is it they take us into a lot of really interesting biology. So one way to have you thinking about the nutrition vitamins is it is there for the guidepost into all kinds of interesting biology.  We've already talked a bit about some of the water-soluble vitamins that are that have tight connections to metabolism through being co-factors of enzymes are going to talk about some other ones that I need lectures of the first lecture is fat soluble vitamins or let's get let's get are soluble.  I didn't eat my vitamins and that's why I can't reach the top of the board.  Let me see something out the erasers as one still here. They're all still here. Alright, that's great. We're doing together with a save half life to see how long it takes. So there is no there is no talk about vitamins without mentioning the name of Casimir Funk which has to be the coolest science name I've ever heard, you know, it could be a bad but Casimir Funk is actually the person who coined the term vitamins and it's worth doing a little bit about him. So Casimir funk in this is actually a westernization. His real name is Casey Amer Funk with a K Funk was the same. It didn't modify that he was a Polish scientist born in the late eighteen hundreds red was reading scientific literature and realize there were certain diseases that were alleviated by feeding people certain foods so that the one he started  And they were giving a substantial amount of brown rice. They would have kept better. He just thought that was amazingly interesting how many people knew this but he decided it had to be that there's a single factor in this food that makes them better. Now. There's no reason to think that's the case. It may be dietary sources what people are getting up but Casimir Funk was convinced. This is the age of early by a substance or a berry berry which is a vitamin B1 and then we isolated a number of other vitamins this way and he thought he was under the impression. They were all a means. You know what that means in it was an Emmy so he called a means for good health.  Vital remains and then I came for the Vitamin vitamin and he would be very proud to walk down the street and see the Vitamin Shoppe and vitamins for sale online and really it was a huge transition in nutrition because it imply there are single factors that are absolutely required for health and the ability to grow and maintain an organism nutritionally some real interesting and these are the ones that he discovered and there's of course the larger number went to talk about so this is actually from his paper in 1912 since a long time ago that you know, he started working. No one had any idea about the component to metabolic illnesses, you know in and this idea of single molecules being important is but if I'm the same idea of specificity so didn't this is a quote from that from it is  Now known that all diseases can be cured by certain preventive substances that isn't the case, of course with the nature of organic basis. We will call him general idea. So one question is how do you divide them from things that are essential like water or mineral? So Ivy essential organic Subs near essential organic substances needed in Trace quantities for normal growth metabolism. Okay, so the yield no energy but many Falcons have many facilitate energy and chemical reactions factors on it that are you know, if you can see why it is important as many of them are co-factors for dozens of different critical a biochemical reactions and that is the case but some of the vitamins are in fact about today.  Have a very interesting alternative important functions that are brought involving Gene regulation rather critical aspects of physiology. So they're involved in the functions of the body development and Immunity go over those if absent from the diet vitamin will produce a deficiency syndromes with you can be very ill from not having a vitamin D but not have a specific deficiency syndrome. So vitamin D does not have a deficiency syndrome is just a general General illness at so and they're not inorganic nutrients. So there are micronutrients that are super important that are minerals and that's a separate category. No Trace there certain Trace elements. We need low concentration of ions that are super important. Those aren't considered vitamins Casimir funk, you know extraction from foods of these critical elements that went missing.  Really obvious and clear syndromes. Okay. So one of the interesting features of understanding all the vitamins is this idea of Total parenteral Nutrition parenteral is an interesting word. That means next to the digestive system means it means nutrition that doesn't involve the intestine minutes. It's nutrition. It's administered by some means other than oral or rectal intake and sulfur most most of the time that's intravenous. The realization that there was a certain number of nutrients that worse countable and not infinitely millions of different suppliers of nutrients certain vitamins is quite possible to raise a human without ever entering food in the gut. It doesn't mean it's going to be optimal nutrition.  Is a very interesting sideline that will probably become more obvious in the next 10 or 20 years is what's the difference between animal nutrition that will keep person alive and an Optimum Nutrition that is a really interesting question as well. But it's the fact that the realization of vitamins meant that was quite possible that you can call it a critical test Complete Nutrition not necessarily Optimum Nutrition. Complete Nutrition. So this is a paper from the journal surgery that was actually published in 1968, which isn't that long ago. I mean, you know last century to you guys, but now there many many people including your professor who were alive and well as this is the first time people are able to put together the idea that you could completely raise an animal or even you know human on this situation.  Mister and I'm involuntary, where they can't use their digestive system. So it's a really important medical tactic to be able to feed, you know, a patient or an organism completely without using your digestive system. So this is a sample but it really is if you want to look at it's a great test of having all the things you need for 4/4 viability because if you don't if you're missing one of those things, you didn't add it to your IV bag or whatever there's trouble. So. So, this is really everything we need this isn't everything that will make life. Perfect. But this is everything we need. It's actually a surprisingly small list of things to to to to to do nutrition fact that the potato the potato is everything a human needs to survive again. It is not optimal nutrition, but you can survive only on potatoes and in the same way everything we need to show here. I'm going to get rid.  Listen to ring Spotlight. But okay, here we go. So we have no carbohydrate glucose alone will do the trick and you know essential fats just these are good enough and linolenic acid or enough because they build those critical low concentration Regulators. You have one plus you can make that from glucose. We have a small number of amino acids are essential minerals trace minerals some questionable vitamins fat soluble and water soluble vitamins. So we want to focus today in the next couple extras on these vitamins cuz they are really interesting and an important and Katie kiss into a lot of cool biology. So there's two general classes of vitamins, and I'm sure you know, this is water and fat soluble vitamins and it really can just look at the strip.  Pictures of them in immediately know what's what the fat side lies are highly hydrophobic. They look like they look like they have long hydrophobic Tails. They're pretty obvious what they are but there's also a small list that you can learn if you're not comfortable with a kind of structural chemistry. So there's water soluble or fat soluble vitamins and they have different properties so fast fast from the body because excretion systems are aqueous. Okay, they don't have much smaller storage the plasma plus about that volume again, where is fat stores can be very different between people and quite large and also so much smaller pools and you can deplete them between 1 and 4 weeks. Okay. So vitamin C takes about 20 to 40 days of deficiency before the first symptoms, and then there's one exception is vitamin. B12 is actually stored very nicely and is not easy to deplete.  Suffern since the end of the classic story of scurvy the British Sailors to go out your Conquering the world and I need to get a fruit and after a couple months their joints are tickets or things start going terribly and after about four or six months, you know that have terrible illness that's only fixed by sources of vitamin C which will talk free dating is but it's a good example of how long it takes for these vitamins to deplete in contrast fat soluble vitamins have a much larger pools of storage so they can take up to a year or the vitamin A deficiency to become so we have these really a pretty prodigious and then takes different from water soluble vitamins is the fact that they can be toxic. So most water-soluble vitamins, you can take them until you just your bank accounts to plead it.  Vitamin studies were one of my heroes scientifically Linus Pauling got way out in the weeds with despite the fact that he had to novel prices of Peace Prize when it comes to present Linus Pauling really taught us how to think about molecular orbitals in a useful way and not being not having to be a professional computational chemist. So Linus Pauling did wonderful things for our our culture has ability to think about molecular and biochemical processes, but vitamin C was not one of those wonderful things and it's just interesting fact that that when someone gets enough clout as an expert, they can be expert about a lot of things. They don't have any clout being experts. I think that's a small little tick mark on an absolutely brilliant career. So don't don't only his Vitamin C remember that he was an absolutely amazing Force generator and thinking about molecular in  cocoa processes anyway  Etsy what was I say? So uptake occurs as Stouffer's fat soluble vitamins event takes not control the can reach toxic levels and we'll talk about some of those examples. So uptake occurs in the small intense intestinal along with lipids. So vitamins that are fat soluble require, you know, moving into things like chylomicrons and lipid that you know, the thing about fat-soluble vitamins as they always have to be there soon side when water moves of the protein that binds them or some kind of a lipoprotein particle. Okay? And so I do have difficulty with drugs that block fat absorption or other problems with that absorption that can impact on vitamin transfer also vitamin deficiency is symptoms that occur when a vitamin is lacking in the diet and body stores become exhausted. So we will delve into that so that we're going to talk about is vitamin A  A vitamin A is comes from a source molecule called beta carotene beta carotene is is the is the sort of plant source of vitamin A and vitamin A is actually this molecule cut in half or you could call this vitamin A depending on how you want to slice it because what happens is it beta carotene and its related molecules are found in the number of Rich carotene Rich plans and you don't need to be at Linus Pauling to Chubbs how that this is going to be a molecule that absorbs a lot of light cuz he has he's conjugated double bonds. So conjugated double bonds meaning right? And so these are where you have a double bond the right next to a double bond. This is a hold-up i, electron system and a long one with many carbs is very good at absorbing Optical wavelengths of light. So these big pie electronic systems are very good at absorbing light and not surprisingly debate occur.  A containing vegetables are brightly colored cuz they're absorbing this amount of light of that and leaving some behind. So it's really cool. It's worth noting. It's worth noting that  polyunsaturated fatty acids are not conjugated Pi systems. So this is the this is the sort of a the party hat of unsaturated fatty acids, and it's not conjugated so they don't have bright colors and they don't have that same kind of reactivity. It's just a different thing. I will add that the TA gave everyone credit for drawing the wrong trans double bond, and we're not going to go back and do anything mean but that is not it get credit for both cuz he felt bad. I don't know where that comes from his awesome. But but this is the correct configuration for a polyunsaturated fatty acids, not trans trans fats are bad retinoids aren't you know, multitrans lipids and they they have this wonderful Optical properties.  But it turns out that what we end up making from his carotenoids is a molecule called retinol, which is absolutely required molecule for a number of different across the seas in this other the vitamin A source, beta-carotene produces retinol through a set of reactions to most common when is it is a rash guard beta-carotene dioxygen days that use oxygen to break this in half into two molecules of retinal like that. Ok, and there are a number of different so there's retinal retinal and retinoic acid and a very lonely here. I'll write this down right now and I'm showing you here.  oops  retinol  andrett to noack to know it acid and a very only y'all use the spotlight. They vary only their see you see that one carbon is oxidized it can either be an aldehyde or a hydroxyl group or a CO2 HR carboxyl group just different oxidation States and that terminal carbon and those three molecules that retinol is the aldehyde the retinol is the hydroxy and their retinoic acid is a carboxylic acid. You probably heard of retinoic acid actually has many properties is one of these vitamin A derived molecules. Okay, we're going to first talk about Retton now because it has his very interesting Optical properties. So probably many of you know that vitamin A and ending molecules are derived from vitamin A are absolutely critical Envision. So this is the first place that the vitamins are going to take us to this is biology. It has to do with vitamins from vitamin A  The retina is produced from inner absolutely critical for the fact that we can see each other and detect light and one of the things is very cool as this is a very ancient a very ancient signaling process. So there's a molecule in the eye called rhodopsin.  Is chalk I bought this truck. I hate it rhodopsin.  And it's related to a protein called.  And your family are proteins that sends light that since photons is ancient. So bacteria has a molecule called bacterial rhodopsin It's actually an Ancient Ancient cousin of the Sabra. It's in her eyes and bacteria use it to sense light also so that idea of using a certain class of signaling proteins to send flight has been around for a long time. Humans have a common ancestor. That's a lot in your gut by three quarters and three quarters of studies, I guess time for summer. No more jokes, just give us the information and we want to go home I get it's okay. So the eye has his beautiful beautiful arrangement of cells and in the back of the eye is a set of cells that detect the light.  So it's kind of funny to censor the lights in some cells are in the back of a layer of cells include the other stuff in the nerves in front of them not a great design in terms of building a camera but a great design in terms of evolving a camera perhaps and so what ends up happening to these layers of cells and in all the way in back of his light sensing cells and those light sensing cells every one of them have you so mavyret sets of membranes that contain a seven transmembrane protein called rhodopsin Andrew Dobson is a protein is basically you want to call it a photon receptor would be one way to put it but it doesn't in this wonderful funny way is if you look back at retinal want to go back this way released carotenoids again notices this distributed pie system here. These molecules are incredibly good at absorbing photons. Like I said, it's her nature is capitalized on that beautiful chemistry coming from plant molecules, like carotenoids to build a molecule that can sense light.  Where does it is rhodopsin is this is a picture of adoption hear one of the things that's really cool as we know a lot about how we see now. So this is one molecule or adoption represented with one of these ribbon diagram. So a x-ray crystallographer is in cry OEM structuralist are very good at figuring out every Atomic arrangement in a protein with the idea that they breathe and wobble around and Sarah Dobson actually is an option molecule with a assist retinol attached to it. Okay, so sis retinol is one of the verge of retinol. I want you to notice this again is a fair amount of chemistry, but if you look so I'm going forward ho no, no, no, no, no backward backwards.  What am I doing? I'm going crazy odessa's backward. I was in the spotlight button. Sorry. I'm blowing my punchlines hero crap. So here we go. So you I want you to notice these guys that this has these are all trans bonds trans double bond. So this one if this was inverted it's called sis right now. So it's flip the other way cis-trans. I'm hoping that's comfortable from all the organic chemistry. You were forced to sit through. Okay and so is oxygen with covalently bound sis retinal detach to it. So it's actually sitting there ready to go. When is it happening is when light strikes that has retinol when the right Photon Lines by summarizes into trans and that causes the option to let go of the Sith retinol of the trans retinol. So here you up you have light by and see her the option and the retinol dissociate the all-trans-retinol floats off into the cell and the  Auction denuded of its small molecule is found in denuded of its cyst retinol now start signaling and it doesn't ever things because I am flexes the change in the cells and generates an electrical signal Anatomy always in the realm of optical physiology. Maybe you had that your physiology class for sale by Logic. So, we're not going to go any deeper into that. But then what happens is that sis retinol a problematic. It's just retinol gets converted by enzymes back into trans retinol and it gets added back on the option to make rhodopsin. Okay, and that is a cycle that happens billions of times a minute in your eye when you're seeing something anytime you're seeing Optical signal it's cuz you're constantly I summarizing the retinol in the transit the option lets go of it be on TuneIn can signal then it takes it back up. Okay. So this is a word version also have a picture versions of retinol is  Mound jobs in proteins to form rhodopsin ceratopsians wrote his option + retinol bound together right now is released from Hopsin when the proton is absorbed. Let's go up for adoption in sis retinol. It becomes rhodopsin trans retinol when it absorbs a photon then it lets go of it and the option is the active component absent from doing its thing as soon as it lets go and start signaling. So it's an interesting way to regulate a circuit and then the restoration of rhodopsin when I get rid of this silly Spotlight, the right restoration or adoption is the trans retinol is converted back to Cicero and all you need's isomerize by an enzyme and then it can recombine with the option to make another rhodopsin ready to receive another Photon. So every single one of these psychos is to pick up one photo shot every single photo.  Is a crap load of each cell because you have to sense light off in a lot. Okay. So here's another nice. This is the sort of visual cycle and I want to focus on when part of it here. Okay, so we're not going to go deep into his physiology. You could teach a whole class on visual physiology and that kind of thing. There's a credible variations in animals and people study at but this is maybe a simpler way to look at the visual sight for these are all in your slides and they're all you know, they're all just different ways to say the same thing. If you if you Google it rhodopsin cycle, you got like a hundred million pictures of this process. There's like two ways people but this is actually pretty simple is rhodopsin is option + 6 retinol, okay.  And it's you get here sis retinol gets converted into gets added to her dopson when light hits it. It releases trans retinol of an electrical signal happens. So this psycho only is looking at the retinol part. Okay. This is only looking at that but this is really not paying much attention to the interesting component the signaling proteins just the vitamin A Product retinol Sol trans retinol is released. It also appears in the blood trans retinol at gets converted into sis retinol and guess and so this an enzyme called rpe65 terrible name is a gene product that was discovered long ago in these genome searches. What's interesting about this enzyme is it is absolutely critical for regenerating the cyst retinol this needed to keep to activate the option protein to be ready to receive another phone shot and it turns out there's a  Make deficiency in rpe65. So so kind of inherited blindness. Okay, and so what's interesting is this is a perfect candidate for gene therapy. And here's why if you're missing the 10 the simple model would be you can just add back a good copy and get it working. And that's near what you've learned about us being recessive recessive gene doesn't work. And in the presence of the normal copy you get function again. That's why if your diploid in your carrying a badge in your so usually okay cuz you have a copy covering it so pressing that recessive phenotype. Okay. So the trouble with gene therapy is usually getting the genes to the site where they might do something is very challenging especially if it's deep inside the body inside of cells, but the eye is pretty accessible. I showed you that chamber, you know, the eye chamber the retinal cells are right along a surface a few cells deep there's liquid in here and so the idea would be if you had a way to give those retinal cells  Gene for rpe65 you would correct the deficiencies. So what happens in patients who have Arby's deficiency is a can't regenerate that needed trans retinol. So you get a very massive decrease in signal and people who don't don't have rpe65 are very deficient in their ability to see and it's mostly just trans retinol. They've taken into the bloodstream from dietary sources, they can't regenerated and those processes happen too fast. So a gene therapy trial was designed a company was was set up through a number of different individuals and they developed a drug called Lux Lux. Aeterna. Let's turn it is nothing more than a virus that will attack not in a bad way, but a virus that will inject its DNA into retinal cells and correct that gingerootz simple viral mechanisms of Gene insertion. And the cool thing is that you wouldn't want that in every single cell in your body. Although nothing much might happen, but they can I know this is  Kind of gross like my eyes blink when I look at it, but they inject B virus into the tissue it infects in a useful way these cells and corrects the Jean by adding another copy. So this was the gene therapy model and they got approval to try it was a trial in this is actually pretty amazing. So this young man in the front is Corey Haase and Corey Haase with his folks and some Physicians from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. That was a major gene therapy school and they actually had a mishap of another gene therapy process. That was more Global some very big problems arose from up with this particular trial work very well. Cory Haas was his situation his situation was it when he was he was nine the youngest person the child is considered legally blind before treatment again, he was confined largely to his house and driveway when playing headed men's difficulty navigating an obstacle course required special.  Large equipment for books to help in the classroom. So today this is in 2009 after a single injection of this gene therapy product. He rides his bike. He's no assistance in the classroom and navigation obstacle course quickly and even is played his first game of softball like that is amazing. That's an amazing transition from a single injection of these viruses. And this is a happy story but gene therapy is fraught with difficulties. I think the age of crispr is going to change some of that and create new problems. But you're you people are in a very exciting time a very exciting transition time for verifiable therapies, and they're going to manifested modifying immune cells correcting jeans that are problematic deep and deep tissue and accessible tissue. It's really an amazing times. This is just one example, and actually the FDA in 2017 approve. This is a general therapy for the people who have rpe65 before you get too excited.  60 by division is a rare disorder, you know very few people are legally blind because they have this enzyme that converts this red trans retinol back to his retinol missing but it is it is every time someone does a therapy like that on a small population. It works that bodes very well for you know, getting it better at at the bigger problems. Okay. So I like aging that's what I'm really interested in them fixing their many functions of retinoic acid to retinoic acid is one of these these three varieties and retinol is the one we talked mostly about for vision, but they all have different functions and retinoic acid is particularly interesting because it is a general regulator of gene expression. So you probably heard of these nuclear hormone receptors Frances, you've heard of testosterone you heard of estrogen you've heard of mineralocorticoids, you've heard of glucocorticoids. Those are all molecules that stimulate a panel of gene expression.  A different changes that are very specific that cause a collection of specific genes to be expressed as one of those a program of gene expression to occur. So this is sort of the way you think about is it has to get to the cells and then it doesn't do anything. So in your book there's a hole there's a whole process is described like this. But the first the first occurrence is that the red noack acid is or vitamin A is contained by retinol binding protein so dead could be retinol or retinoid acid It's contained by that it's bound to two different proteins retinol binding protein in transit Richmond. These are just two carrier proteins in the blood the point being that these lipids it have to get around or either carried and lipoproteins. Are there carried by binding proteins? So their particular retinol binding proteins that drag these things into the bloodstream and keep them.  Sorry about they are then move into the tissue. So this is extra the whole map of things that occur and basically vitamin A retinol retinoic acid ends up in the in the cells that are picking it up. It binds to another carrier protein is cytoplasm and then gets transferred to the retinoic acid receptor and that causes a whole panel of gene expression. So not surprisingly these vitamin A derivatives have many physiological functions Beyond Vision. So the vision is a very special one is that does not involve gene expression of activate of a of a signaling protein is activated by an addict but the major function of retinoic acid along with that is is to do this panel of gene expression. So off some of the ones that are important to see needed for proper immune function in the gut and other tissues so children with low vitamin A can get diarrhea due to impaired gut immunity that have a problems maintaining and controlling their microbial it's worth  The microbiome in the immune system do this fancy dance with each other where the microbes signal the immune system the immune system keeps the bad ones at Bay and they all work together. So pretty vacations of the microbiome or the immune system can cause really big problems in the gut because of that dance being perturbed. It's also needed for structural Integrity of tissue. So many tissues require certain programs of gene expression to be maintained and differentiate correctly this actually one of the tissues it's really strongly affected by vitamin A deficiency is epithelial cells and B cells that line a lot of the lumens of organs and they can be flattened and shaped all wrong when when you have a vitamin A deficiencies discusses many physiological problems, and there's no way we're really used to eating pretty robust diets. It's very hard to starve to death in the United States. If you have access to even any food supply that doesn't mean there aren't starving people in the United States.  Bass socioeconomic disparity but there's lots of food available for people who can afford it, but that's not the case in in every country in this in this study was done in 2009 were they just come by all the countries that are impacted severely moderately mildly and not at all by vitamin A deficiency in the thing is there's a ton of people suffering from severe vitamin A deficiency in our world, you know, it's just something to think about it, you know, there's a bundens & paucity and they're just all intertwine with each other interesting problems to solve some of the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency or not surprisingly vision problems because of this importance in the retinol version of vitamin A retinol to regenerate rhodopsin, we saw very fancy version where there's an enzyme that wasn't resupplying that retinol, but there can be versions where you just not providing the molecules that all through diet.  Zero found which is a loss of mucus do this epithelial effects of the eyes, you can get dry eye and corneal sloughing so that it's funny. This part is due to is a vision effect, but it's due to this epithelial differentiation affect. You can get infections due to impaired immunity in the GI tract and skin dysfunctions due to due to problems in the differentiation program that the retinoic acid causes in the skin. Okay. So I'm those are some different things. So this is a little sort of recapping of the vitamin A deficiency in the important thing is that without enough vitamin a death will ensue so you can get a you can get a vitamin A deficiency efficiently low that the person will die just like with other vitamin A vitamin deficiencies. So these are some of the most of these are you know, our our vision related but not all of them. Okay. This is the normal function. But with this is the first time we've talked about a vitamin A.  Toxicity so the fan soluble vitamins are the first place were really talking about a nutrient that has over toxicity know someone could easily argue that table sugar has over toxicity and that's true but it's over many years, you know, so that is a whole other conversation about, you know, the toxicity of overabundant natural nutrients than a real interesting conversation, but this is actually a case where you can have you can have toxicity first. We'll talk a little bit more sources of vitamin A this there's a term that popped up on the raas is the written Noah Cassidy equivalent. This is the Army retinol activity equivalents retinol activity. Bowman's retinol is one of the ways to do I assign vitamin A activity cuz he's are all interconverted with each other and retinol. It's going to be easier to measure so I'm so this is the way that the FTD fee Food and Drug Administration has decided to measure vitamin A activity because he does a lot of  Plant sources of being converted into reading all these different carotenes and carotenoids. So it's sort of this gold standard is how much retinol can you generate and so the thinking is PE right here. I don't know why my guy that that's a weird artifact. Okay, so retinol activity equivalents of these things. So one of these notices that beef liver an animal products, you can get a ton of vitamin A totally available, but it is also available in many vegetables was brightly colored vegetables that are orange and red and when leaves turn red cuz you're all Southern California, but in the fall leaves go from green to red and that's the carotenoids lasting longer than the chlorophyll and it's absolutely beautiful get a chance to see in Autumn. You must some day in your life. See you in Autumn is just nothing like it. It is really why people live in those cold climates. I'm pretty convinced I grew up in an Autumn an Autumn pause.  Environment and it's something that is just in from my wife is never seen Autumn. I had to convince her it really happen to know.  All the trees they don't believe it. Okay, so then those plants are brightly colored like a mango if you ever seen him and other bright orange dark green sweet potatoes orange. These are all brightly colored. So that thing about eating a brightly colored vegetables. There's a grain of Truth in that, you know, okay, so but beef liver is a fantastic source of vitamin A as well. So the thing is is that vitamin A is also something that can impose substantial toxicity didn't want you to notice that this fight is small number of syndromes and symptoms that come with vitamin A paucity. There's a huge number of problems that come with vitamin A toxicity. So I mean this list is very long. I think I've isolated here is even have a cute effects meeting right away. If you take too much vitamin A you can immediately acute means right away, you know is your gastrointestinal headaches dizziness muscle and coordination nature changes in you know, in in sense of well-being and and feeling good.  Liver damage hair loss bone and muscle pain loss of these are serious things poem fractures hemorrhages and then they're also need Vitamin a2x developing embryos. So too much vitamin A can cause fetal malformations and a spontaneous abortion. So these are really serious things and so the ulv, you know, the upper limit that we talked about Jerry has a really important thing. I'm what's amazing. Is it vitamin A toxicity is not really that much higher like some vitamins. You can just take them till the cows come home with vitamin A is not one of those vitamin show a vitamin A is the greatest risk of toxicity have just two to four times the RDA can start happening. So, you know, there's this as some of the symptoms again, so the the upper limit is 300 micrograms of a retinol activity equivalents per day or 10000 international units. I mean, you know if you're dealing with this is a nutritionist  Position you're going to look that up. So I don't care that, you know these things but it's important to know that the window between good, you know taking and overuse can be not that high. Okay. So now the thing that's interesting about carotenoids as they cause an orange color, you know, this is really true that it makes you wonder Nation for the strange tent of our commander-in-chief. We don't know no one really knows some things. He's very open about some things. He's very secretive about tax and orange color or two of them. So it may be the guy that would be good at but it is true that people who eat a lot of carrots you so this is actually an example. This is a guy and this is his hand and these are two of his his family members and this guy drank a quart of carrot juice a day. So, you know, that's a quart of charges. It is a lot but it's not an astronaut in cold water diet. You know, it's it's a it's a knack.  Show me a reasonable amount of a can I tell you a funny story about that problem, you know, the cold water diet that came from a dinner. I went out with a bunch of Faculty. She have this is our class. Are you have a bunch of phds sitting around who don't know anything about nutrition and we start batting around the ideal. What if you just drink cold water with that use enough energy to lose weight because we didn't know the difference between a big calorie and a little calories that we all decided. It would be a great way to lose weight. Cuz if you drink a liter of water to be a thousand calories and you know, if you had to hit it one degree submit not realizing that we would need to have ordered several hundred gallons of cold water to get any benefits. So that's where that problem came from an actual conversation if people are really smart and really ignorant. Sonu credibly dangerous combination. So is there you go anyway, so this is a perfect example of that and so is there some course, you know, epidemiological and health studies that come through with this so high carotenoid diet slow.  The risk of cancer and I'm not talking about high carotenoid like, you know causing these terrible chronic symptoms and the important point is it is very hard to eat plans to the extent that you will get vitamin A toxicity. This comes from supplementing and taking, you know, concentrated vitamin A that's available. So it would be very hard to eat so many carrots that you're going to get some of those vitamin A toxicity. You'll turn orange before that happens. Okay, but so, you know High carotenoid diet does not mean, you know, millions of units of our ABCs and just being so diet rich in these things and there's a number of a cohort and case-control studies it indicate some very Striking Effects unless though that there's an improved benefit after lowering the risk of lung cancer. Now, this is a carotenoid diet meaning those kinds of plants is spinach to Mangos the other stuff like that. Okay, so you might think well then nothing to do the thing to do is just take beta carotenoid supplement.  Beta carotene supplement, you know that single molecule. So there's actually a study this is incredibly to come up with an acronym that describes the study. So this is the beta carotene and retinol efficiency trial so carotene and retinol the physics somebody probably got their PHD for thinking up that acronym like you. Okay, that's enough you win. OK does the beta carotene and retinol if it has a carrot which is pretty brilliant, but here's the thing so they said they tested it in people with high risk for lung cancer. I think they were hoping that they would get bigger effects. If you take people at high risk, the numbers are high they did numbers move down there. There's a higher signal-to-noise ratio. If you want me to look at it cuz he answered answered cancer higher so they were tested the effect of daily beta-carotene. So 30 mg and retinyl palmitate, which is one version of you know retinol delivery.  Incidence of lung cancer other cancers indefinite 18,000 participants who are at high risk for lung cancer because of a history of smoking or asbestos exposure.  Carrot was stopped ahead of schedule in January. He read along with me. Everybody will read together and I'm fitting in receiving the active intervention were found to have a 28% increase in incidence of lung cancer 70% increase in incidence of death and a higher rate of cardiovascular diseases while the city was going on the beta carotene was causing increased incidence of cancer cardiovascular disease and overall death. So this is a really interesting in this is compared with the placebo group. So this is at least one case.  We're taking the single molecule is not equivalent to taking the plant that has that molecule and a thousand other things in it. I'm a big fan of supplements. I take them every morning. At least it makes me drink a lot of water. That's my feeling is if for nothing else is making me drink a lot of water which is good. But so, you know, but it is interesting that it is not always the case of the single molecule that's implicated important is the only thing going on there. I might be delivery rate. It might be the way it's metabolize. It might be other things that come along for the ride. It's not clear. So this is actually some of the press it doesn't mean if you take beta carotene, you're going to get lung cancer. It means that the probability shift a little bit and it's very hard to think about these epidemiological cases that this is actually from that study. Sorry one of these days from the carrot study.  Stop with this cute name and a disastrous result if it's like I thought of that stupid name anyways, you know, but anyway, so this is you know, this is the no beta carotene the beta carotene. This is the incidence of lung cancer overtime over a number of years so that you know that uptick which might seem fairly small and it is very small is statistically highly significant when you compare Placebo about and what's it's worth. It's worth thinking about okay, we're going to do a little text questioning where we got here. I have asked the same question about Pepsi before my pharmacology Professor. He said pot pipes and couldn't really help with flush that much because of flesh is caused by histamine. I can H1 probably cross-reactivity. Mr. Pharmacology Professor who knows and kill off gut microbiota tpn.  What's tpn?  Why is there no data in the chart of vitamin A deficiency for the us because hardly anybody in the US has vitamin A deficiency in big pocket. So you can find people with with dietary division, but they'll be distributed in that was supposed to 2009. Maybe they didn't collect it. Why doesn't the FDA regulate vitamin supplement beautiful question supplement regulation is highly regulated and that's too purely to Legal Shenanigans to make it physically possible to sell them it is if you want to watch there's a really great movie called faster stronger cheaper now about anabolic steroids and supplements that I can recommend you. It's really an interesting topic very important question. Is it true that the vitamins found in supplements are in different confirmation? Everybody needs. Usually. I mean usually the molecules are the molecules but it depends on the particular what I mean, that's that's a question with lots and lots and lots of different possibilities question.  Owen TBN TBN a total parenteral Nutrition. Can I find my brain? I don't have enough vitamin A. Thank you. That was the text message General jumping in the real world. So would tpn kill off the gut microbiota know because they're very resourceful at extracting in this true that the gut microbiota would not get very much flow through them. So it's an interesting question that my know is a little too quick cuz you can live a Xanax early with no gut microbiota, so wonderful question and I don't know the answer to it. So I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to find out because that's a cool question. If there's some microbial lab people in this class. Why don't you go ask your microbiome expert TI's and come back and tell us we're both doing. Okay. Let's see. That's that's that and I think we have a little  Relation and let's get out those Clickers.  It's taking longer than I thought but that's okay. I'm the boss.  Plus, it's Thursday.  I like dress that no, but that no one's quite clear on why.  And it was a higher risk group so near that might have some to do with it. Okay ready?  Which is worse for you according to epidemiological studies?  protein from fresh red meat protein from processed meat protein from eggs protein from plant sources, which is worth you from the epidemiological studies we talked about  Oh, oh good for you. I'm just losing my shit today. Hold on vitamins. All right.  Here we go. Here we go.  I can tell from the slope of the Curve.  All right.  I want to spend a real long time of these. Are we ready?  Reddit  Okay, I'm going to stop you have a few more chances if you're not clicking yet.  Okay, stop.  Damn good for you. Don't eat that. Salami corned beef pastrami is awesome is rarely. That's good. Okay.  We learn that.  The legal blood alcohol concentration for the State of California just for regular not for Uber drivers not for people under 21. Just regular the regular number is 8% 1% and 8% o 8% Which one is it?  hair we go  Okay, we have a previous count.  boom  These are the people are looking forward to Friday 8 % All right, another one celiac disease is  a sensitivity to fodmaps a response to animal protein sensitivity to gluten another name for IBS, which is it.  Oh damn, I didn't think I would learn after eight hundred repetitions it is alright, which is it.  Where we assume you people.  All right.  Yes, a sensitivity to gluten. So the teaching process is working or you're all Architects and of already studied Alaska the last thing that's that for that no alcohol is metabolized by  Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow, sorry.  Alcohol is metabolized by ald.  I'm actually supposed to be a DH followed by a LDH. Sorry.  Hold on.  hair we go  sorry.  And where we $88.  Okay ath followed by LDH liver meos pyruvate dehydrogenase both A and B.  Jose and B pyruvate dehydrogenase liver meals  88 followed by a LDH  All right. I'm going to stop.  I saw those three people leave so I know another not here.  It is.  both A&B cool the process works  This is the major. This is the major one, but this is definitely a contributor and this second one is very important when you drink frequently or you drink a lot because it's an overflow system and it's an inducible system. So they're both super important, okay?  Let's see there a few more questions. Question about TP and it's really interesting. I'm going to look into that. They question that was on the floor is is there a hypothesis for why beta carotene alone is somehow worse than exacerbates the same cancer that high carotenoid diet seem to lessen. There is not a strong hypothesis for a mechanism are they have done further studies taken that dated find a person in the group to see if there's something they could split out from it and it seems there a certain subgroups that are more important than others, but the lump total there's not a mechanistic hypothesis. It's a very complex question, but it's a great question. So now it looks like this this is called Cole calciferol.  And vitamin D is actually taken up in a number of different forms in converted by multiple organs into what's called 1 dihydroxyvitamin D3. So it's 125 dihydroxy.  Vitamin D3. This is the most active version of vitamin D. But we ingest different versions of it. So there's a number of different sources is vitamin D3 that people can get in the diet or vitamin D2 which is another a precursor of vitamin D. And those are converted either by UV light or taken up in the diet to make vitamin D3 which is called cholecalciferol. And that's what shown on this previous slide. It really looks a lot like cholesterol the we don't synthesize this we take up other plants and other organisms make it be it's not connected here, but it has a very similar structure when it's folded the right way to clearly lipid-soluble is covered with hydrocarbon. So it's very lipid-soluble. Then deliver takes the coke House of the D3 and converted into wine hydroxy calcidiol and then he died hydroxy D3 is made in the kidney. So it's taking up in the gut.  The skin converts some of the earlier precursors a D3 to D3 is taken in by the liver and converted to 1 hydroxy form. And then they want a drugstore mistaken it by the kidney in converted into the dihydroxy form. They have different half-lives in the blood OK and the UV defendant step is less efficient than older people people with darker skin and people live in high smog areas, which kind of interesting is. I was actually going to my doctor because I'm of an age where I want to start getting my numbers together being a newlywed looking for Medicare. I want to live as long as humanly possible. So I got all my numbers ending my doctor told me that San Diego has a weird vitamin D deficiency does not easily explain where the Sun City is many sunny days is a lot of ulcer over some reason people in San Diego and many other cities have low vitamin D that's hard to explain and that's actually turns into be a national Trend also, so it started  Multi-organ cooperation for vitamin D production. So vitamin D2 can come from the diet vitamin D3 can also come from the diet depending on the source of fish milk. There's a good plant sources to S converted D2 is converted to D3 by light and then the D3 that's generated either by diet or light is converted in the liver to 1 hydroxy D3 and then 121 25. Dihydroxy D3 is the is the strongest version of this is made in the kidney. So there's this whole process going on this multi-organ process and vitamin D3 is another one of these hormones that can fit stimulates gene expression. So there's a vitamin D3 receptor that binds and it goes and turns on a lot of gene expression. So these are these are molecules into a lot of things vitamin A and vitamin D both do a lot of things. Okay, so it's critical for bone growth in the young increases calcium absorption by the intestine calcium release from bone to to maintain blood calcium.  So it is has hormone affects. It affects a differentiation of the skin. It has medical benefits. So it didn't Hibbetts development of breasts colon and prostate cancers at the right levels. It supports resistance to infection and some of the sources are fish or defied milk, but fortunately there plant sources to mushrooms soy almond milk and sunlight. So those are all things and they first two are we eating or animal products in the next four are non eating or plant products? Okay. So Ricketts despite their does vitamin D deficiency will cause a syndrome called rickets if children are deprived of vitamin D. They have very big problems in bone development. So they get bowed legs and they also get substantial growth of certain tissues that are normally constrained by good bone density. So this the heads and rib cage is said to be larger because the bone developments wrong and the legs are on  The legs are bowed since is called rickets. That's funny. They say that vitamin D deficiency is an observable, but I think what that means is that an if an adult who grew up eating normally is the pride of enemy. They don't develop a deficiency syndrome. Where is an adult being deprived of any of the other vitamins would develop an overt deficiency syndrome, even if they develop normally cuz this is clearly a deficiency syndrome, but it's contingent on a child undergoing bone development was kind of amazing. Is that Ricketts? That's what this is. You just called can be completely reversed if a child is a Cockerel enough. So this is a picture of a child with rickets and very debilitated not enlarged head rib cage, very strange Anatomy bowed legs and after 14 months. This child is running around and completely normal. So that's a happy ending to this problem. But there's like vitamin-a. There are vast pockets of of the world where people are vitamin D deficient so vitamin D requirements. There's also an upper limit  I'm so no rdas is because everyone process is it differently and it's contingent on organ size Oregon activity light exposure skin tone. There's really no RDA that's been at you know, that that statistically designed when there is an AI and acceptable intake and that's 600 units per day for people under 7804 people above. So this is the number of micrograms of vitamin D3. So this is interesting though new research and I've seen some of these papers indicate that megadosing vitamin D might decrease infection. This is the new I know many people take tons of vitamin D because they claim it keeps him from getting sick. Who knows if that's true because I'm very prone to believe my own data, especially if it's positive. So I keep a cold log because anytime I got to call and it's clear that every 6 months I get a cold no matter what I do. It's his eye.  Like I tried hand sanitizer and I was incredibly so I had in my pocket in my thing on airplane into it and you six months Boone call Mike. So no more hands and it didn't make a difference. It might make a difference for other people. So this is the interesting thing is in toxicity depletes calcium in bones and increases calcium deposits of the jacuzzi is causing mobilization of calcium. It can cause bone malformations and calcification of soft tissue and kidney stones for certain people susceptible. And that's it for thousand units a day. So you'll notice that there are in a research indicating that the same units that might be problematic could help with infections. So what to do, you know, this is an interesting question and you might be a physician and have someone who swears by the fact that they take 10000 today and they haven't gotten a call for 2 years, but their bone density is going down. What are you tell them, you know get them hand sanitizer. So this is actually a meta-analysis of a number of different vitamin D study.  Studies of people with breast cancer and it appears that the if you do a meta-analysis in this is typical medical analyses Sur this pretty wheel wobbly data with statistical significance that increasing a blood levels of vitamin D up to this in this is a pretty normal level. I decrease the increase the increases survivability of breast cancer these people who have gotten breast cancer and been treated if their blood levels of vitamin D are higher they have a higher survival chance. Their Hazard ratio is lower. That doesn't mean they're going to be cured it means they'll live longer, you know, it's important and interesting ly and missed, you know, integrating these faxes curious is this is a study done in 2009 that long ago looking at two different things as the number of people that are above a certain level in the United States is the United States unlike that reasonable complain about the lack of information for up very large number of different cohorts. So this is age  Over-aged this is the two two biological genders. This is the race and ethnicity. So you see across the board that this is a study that was done about 15 years ago This Is Us ending so much more recently. So the gray is more recent in everybody's lower across the board. Everybody has lower than it did far fewer people who are above 30 nanograms per ml. Okay, so well, maybe they're just dialing in the right amount. So this is the people who are below 1000. That's very low. So across-the-board is gender ethnicity people have are more prone to have to low vitamin D and less prone to have too high vitamin D across the board. So this is a there's a vitamin A sufficiency is declined dramatically between 1990 and 2002 special importance African Americans. For some reason. It's not so clear or surfing the most whether that's a cultural interplay or it's not clear why  It is but it's important to be understanding of these things and it's not that hard to supplement vitamin D. So I one of the things you can get measured when you get your numbers down to the doctor is your blood vitamin D. You're a Coke calciferol levels and it's not a bad idea because like I said, it's something that's been observed all over the place. So we're going to talk a little about vitamin E and I realized it when 20 comes we're going to wrestle our way out of here. So I'll get as far as I can in this actually impact some very interesting at data. So this is tocopherol. So Alpha took off her all is one version. It turns out when you read the definition of vitamin E is actually eight different molecules into certified Commission of different to Copper Alton. They all basically have the same business and so here on switch the spotlight mode see that that business and doesn't that looks sort of like something we used to study that looks certain vaguely like Coke you go on a ring with a long tail.  This turns out because of that that I'm dying to see that double bond carbon double bond. This is really really prone to get a redo. So it's an antioxidant, you know, it's it's very prone. I mean to get oxidized to donates electrons and get oxidized. So this thing is a is an antioxidant antioxidant spacely step in and allow themselves to be oxidized instead of things were it's a problem so that certain way to view an antioxidant is anyway, so this is a collection of tocopherol there and there's also there's also alcohol there alcohol and other versions of this that together form vitamin E. And basic vitamin E is good for is it's an antioxidant. It is a probably a biologically evolved antioxidant that we use in a variety waste of roping. These are reactive oxygen species got one more minute. That clock is fast my GPS satellite people deficiency.  Hemolysis and red blood sensitivities oxidative damage. Okay, you can take up to seven years to start with deficiency. So this is a very gradual thing and there's reason for that. I'll show you probably the next next lecture is a case of premature infants or 1. One of the things is a deficiency of alpha-tocopherol or vitamin E is particularly noticeable in cases where you have oxidative stress to one case that's particularly clear as they used to put premature infants in oxygen tents and they still do sometimes because they're in their ability to absorb oxygen is not great yet their lungs aren't fully developed at that young age. And so children who David vitamin D deficiency and are in pure oxygen or suffering greater oxidative stress and they can't handle it. So it has been cases of those children becoming blind because of the perfect storm of high oxygen and low vitamin E smokers are more likely develop a vitamin D deficiency because they're stressing their system where they demand more of it cuz they  Have a lot of oxidative stress from the chemicals that they're smoking. The toxicity is the UL is 1000 mg. That's a gram a day of his fat-soluble Vitamin. That's quite a lot in these symptoms are hemorrhaging. I think it's fair to stop here and we will go and talk about oxidative damage next. "
