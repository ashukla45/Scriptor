Okay, that's why the more relevant question is why does obesity fall in the 65 + age compared to 40564 TI show the chart of obesity because they died. That's why the number go down because people who are Abby's this is at least the thinking is that that burden of obesity for a long enough time has tolls on lifespan longevity. So there's a weeding process the trouble is that a lot of these Trends you'll see when I show you and I'll be a little dipper something usually people don't know why those modifications happened. It's perfectly valid to ask but this is the thinking about this one.  It's another interesting question. You're not being very inclusive in this height chart of yours.  Because I showed this one and it started at my high cuz I'm totally self-centered.  But there was a reason first of all anybody in 8 seconds can look up a BMI calculator with the phone. It's like trivial now, you don't really even need charts. But also the chart was like incredibly long and I couldn't show it cuz it wouldn't be readable. So I Funk hated it apologies to all those diminutive people who fell unincluded and unsafe. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, I stand corrected. This is what one of the rare gray flies. I stand corrected. I said some some person in the front answer the question that I said that the restaurant business has a 1% profit margin. So I wrote my good friend Paul Saginaw who owns a number of very successful restaurants and I texted him and said what's the deal and he told me that restaurant simply have a 3 to 5% profit margin is still incredibly narrow and that's in profit margin has a lot to do with what's going on with the food chain and a food supply. They're not unrelated things, but it's actually 3254.  Importantly grocery stores are 1% everything the grocery stores profit. Margin. I just was thinking about this has everything to do with the problems that we're having with the food supply is actually really interesting to think about grocery Commerce and what's being sold to you to the largest extent very interesting will talk a bit more about it. We talked about this right? So I stand corrected.  Okay. Now we're talkin we're talking about obesity in the Obesity epidemic and a pandemic because so many people have it sound like a disease. It pops up its really unbelievably common. So I showed you some data from this really wonderful state of obesity. Org. That's this organization from Robert Wood Johnson Medical Facility University of Michigan that goes through each state and they update them every year or two. So it's really accurate description of the sort of demographics of nutrition and obesity and they came up with 37.7% B city, which is really high number in a considering that you know, that's going up massively in the last few decades. Okay. I'm so it did truth in trouble. As I said, it's a to b c rates or even a bit worse cuz State obesity rates are collected by the brfss, which is the behavioral risk factor surveillance system, which is from the center of Disease Control.  Play Bandstand by phone surveys. And as I said people tend to underestimate their weight and overestimate their height you like I'm six 2K 18 lb anyway, and then the the nhanes which is the national health and nutrition examination survey is much better cuz they use physician day. Today is day. Do you know when you go to the doctor no matter what your complaint they always way you and take your height. If I but I have a cold and send that information is actually very useful to acquire. So in the truth of the matter is that they probably just a testament that are already enormous are probably 5 to 10% to low. So all them all the more important and another thing about this obesity pandemic obesity observation. Obesity crisis is that it's happened very rapidly and there's good reason for that. So the rapid atego is here. This is the cdc's estimate of different state obesity. So this is  Less than 10% of the light blue white is no data. So this is a little bit misleading but people weren't thinking about it so much in 1985 and then needs to see other states by 1996 your 10 years later and then the incredible by 2010 all of the numbers have gone up from the 1510 to 15% 2/25 30% super fast and you already know something about that if it happens that fast it's not genetic. It's not like some new set of mutations or even some set of alleles has reshuffled to make this happen. This is something that at least has a very strong component with things that happen rapidly like, oh, I don't know the rise of industrial ice food. I don't know, you know, something like that, but it can have genetic overlay, you know, the interesting question as to what extent in genetics play a role in this amazing and Incredibly important and very relevant transition.  still going to talk about  So the nearest Sears at this is state-by-state adult obesity rates pretty current night. Does you just different ways to to look at it? And these numbers are all coated in the same way, but you know, they they vary by state but they're high everywhere. Okay, if they think it's absolutely incredible about this is that youth obesity is very high now back in the day obesity was really something that became increasingly problematic as people age and I'll actually show you the clinic on the Harris Benedict equation that actually makes beautiful sense of that because our basal metabolic rate drop with age as a public helping everybody is basal metabolic rate drops today and it is a going problem is people get older they tend to put on weight more easily. It's just a fact it's actually a physiologic effect, but the incredible thing about this obesity epidemic is that it's now affecting incredibly young children including children in the age.  224 who are so high on the so high on the percentile chart that they've had to read name some of the illnesses. They no longer called type 2 diabetes adult onset diabetes, which is what they used to call it because so many children now have it we're talking about 4 to 8 to 10 year olds. This is incredibly important problem is also huge benefits in terms of the fiscal and medical interface system. You know, it is really a problematic and we know we're just learning how to deal with it. So it's not just children. It's also not just the US of a show is it turns out it's a global problem. It is not a United States problem and here is there several ways to look at this chart. So this is actually shows by Usher this one for so this is current or 2008 World Health Organization. So young very serious Global organization trying to figure out what things affect health and this is the sort of  Beat me your number. So here's a note ended 20% less than 10% greater than 30% You can start again in industrialized countries.  Countries that have a lot of affluence and food supply but it's not only that it's the whole world but there is a very interesting feature of the rate that this is happened. Number one, like all cases it was right about the rate is super fast decades not centuries decades. Okay, so that's one thing like, this is 1970.  All the way up to most of you were a good idea where Beyond a good idea right here, right? So this happening but I want you to look at me USA the USA had a huge Head Start and then these other companies started Ebenezer a country started coming along and there's a reason for that. Hey, let's invent waste industrializing food supply. Let's sell it to other countries, but the fact is but now it's a global problem or Global observation. Okay. So this is actually wear that another thing is pretty amazing is how fast this is happened. So let's try this. I'm getting really high on putting websites here is could destroy the computer but let's see. This is actually a very interesting website. Okay. This is a gift.  Today's just showing the the rate over different years.  And again, this is each of those tick marks is a year.  And this is all data has been collected by the World Health Organization.  So, you know now you're like going to your prom or trying to figure out where to cut college would interest you need to go into medicine are there medical problems to deal with? I don't know maybe obesity may be in type 2 diabetes because I mean it's amazing, isn't it? Look at that?  This darn pretty colors, but darn depressing.  And this is at its top they're okay now. Can I get back out nose stopped up. You don't need to have a reminder. Okay. I think it's going to work.  Hey, it worked. Okay, so you can see the basic ideas already seem to have started in the United States. It seems to have started around 1950 maybe a little before that 40s after World War II Baby Boom the incredibly uptick in the economy and then it spread worldwide. Okay, if the risk is high for all but it's not identical. So it turns out that African Americans have the highest risk currently a Latino a little bit higher than end Caucasian lower in this is a complex number this number has a lot and I'm not going to unpack this number you need like five classes unpack to some of their socio-cultural issues the genetic issues their opportunity issues. There's a lot going on but it's useful to know them as tomorrow's health or Wellness providers and end position. So it seemed useful to understand that okay, here's an example of childhood abuse childhood obesity is  Like I said a giant problem. So this is actually a picture of I thinking eat a 7 year old who is morbidly obese and you know what? This is not to make fun of this child. This child is facing severe health issues in potential severe health issues. I'm although I would I do want to say that it is not as simple as that. If you were obese, you're sick. It's more complex than that and we will talk about some of the nuances that at the end of this lecture, but it is quite clear that being obese makes one's quality of life and potential for wellness a lot lower in our Ken. So this is a beast children have a set of seven or eight percent full risk higher becoming obese adults, you know, it's it's sort of its asset thing. I never three-quarters of a length of normal children become obese adults who really if a child gets to that place for a probably again a variety of complex reasons about eating habits, you know cultural and stresses.  Physiology biochemistry again. This is a pretty complex transition here. But it's it's an observing epidemiological observation. Okay, so the important meeting is awesome. And you know, why do we care in? The reason is that obesity is responsible for connected to a large number of maladies and health difficulties understand fairly. Well some of them we don't understand will it all? Okay. So this is actually from a really great review by hot tub. It's Ago by Golden Hawk documents ago. I've actually interacted with him at conferences cuz I eat study stero regulation in that kind of thing are used to uncertain more out of that now but me and her something about this guy don't feel funny about his name. His name is so hard to pronounce or so everyone calls him gouken. No one called him doctor has been difficult. And also if you go to his lab website, everyone in the lab is videos YouTube his name.  Diversity but anyway, so this is actually from a really interesting review that he wrote about the connection between inflammation and obesity and I'll go King's view on this which is really really interesting is that the reason that inflammation and obesity are so closely connected is because the original cell types from the earliest organisms had the immune cells and the Abbot besides connected in the same organ. And so there's this deep connection between energy storage and Immunity that has spread to different organs, but it's still connected through signaling really intriguing idea. But the point finger obesity causes air brings about Earth core lady. Let's say mechanistically in some ways. We understand better. These are the diseases that we understand better not well, but better about why obesity is contributory to them and use it once we don't really understand well that all that obesity causes or is it responsible for certain kinds of cancers? Asthma sleep apnea osteoarthritis?  Suck a panoply of major diseases are so this is why were interested in this in terms of medicine. And the reason we're interested in nutrition classes, cuz it's quite clear. This obesity epidemic has everything to do with a different kind of nutrition. So I actually hadn't thought about this in the same way. But, you know, we talked about vitamins. We always talk about you know,  Acceptable intake and we talked about upper limits, right and we talked about deficiencies. And sometimes we talked about toxicity associated with these, you know, if you go below this, you know, the recommended daily you get deficiencies if you go above you while you get toxicities and we talked about iron and calcium and I was everything the way to look at the Obesity epidemic above the UL for a bunch of macronutrients and we're going way below the AI for a number of poorly understood micronutrients, including phytochemicals and things that we really don't have a handle on but that we know too many many many epidemiological studies are important for wellness and health. Okay. So this is it's a very interesting run that has everything to do with nutrition and it's frustrating for biomedical and biochemistry and Physiology students like yourself cuz you're used to study mechanism and you go to a class in the membrane.  Impulse goes down and then and then you think something like that you need to get a lot of neck and here's how DNA works at John's this code and it makes it so it's very frustrating to take mostly epidemiologist as we know there's a connection between this 5000 molecules and this state of health, but we don't know what it is that is not a bad position for tomorrow's biomedical scientist. Tomorrow's Wellness delivers Mars doctors because you're used to having nicely packaged answers to redeliver like shooting a basket that you know, so, you know, we're moving you from from answer delivers to question formulators. And that is the goal. You want to become question formulators. Okay. So this is and this is the really important questions working here. Okay, so I want to talk a little about some of the disease risk. So, you know, this is actually a pretty classic graphic shown it another classes and I've seen it in other places, but there's a number of different maladies that go up with  Increasing BMI with the caveat that BMI is a very crude indicator of of obesity and obesity pathology, you know, it's really basically taking her weight and dividing it by your height in a certain way that gives you a number so with that caveat in my life, even with that very crude Public Health measure, it's quite clear that these lines all go up in some of them like type 2 diabetes go up substantially the relative risk of getting type 2 diabetes at a public health devil is definitely higher as BMI goes up. So that's one that's all know that this is a lipid disease is hypertension coronary heart disease. They all attended trending upwards. This is women in this is man and they both genders go up. Okay, so there's some other risks that are pretty remarkable and not nearly as obvious. I heart disease makes a lot of sense cuz you plug the arteries up with some of these Neil really nasty lipids that we tend to eat and the high  Salt by pretension, you know that comes with it, you know, when you view with obesity off and comes poor diet not always a meanness this connections here that makes him sent but is quite clear there certain cancers that you are at greater risk for being obese also say this is actually a pretty classic study from 2003 overweight obesity mortality from cancer is this is a study cohort study. However, they were following for adding 16 years large number of people in this is typical of these kind of studies or not. It doesn't mean if you eat a cheeseburger, you're going to get cancer means that a lifetime diet and subsequent obesity that occurs from it gives you a higher risk of these illnesses the thing that's so sweet of perplexing about obesity is there are so many maladies that are increased by a by having a high body mass index in by having especially certain kinds of a b c d. So you end up with a person who's in a state of General poor health is much more prone to get a variety of  Eos's I need a question. We don't know is if you have like 1.5 or 1.5 / 1.5 fold risk for five different diseases. What does that do to the General Health inability to to be well of someone who has that situation. I was in real important. Okay. So this is these are different cancers prostate Non-Hodgkin's and some of them, you know, I got substantial pancreatic cancer actually has high liver cancer is a substantially Elevate in this isn't a shock because one of the places obesity impact very strongly is the liver's function the fatty liver disease like we talked about a little bit. This is a is it women than the same thing? Both both groups both a biological genders have this tendency? Okay about doing this is looks like an answer and this is actually from Nigel's lectures where he shows these particular studies are really cool cell culture Mouse model studies in the  Is it possible answer and I promise you none of these studies are the answer they are interesting observations that may have something to do with some of these maladies and they're worth looking at a very unfair service to you to tell you here is the mechanism now we know it and unless I'm very careful to tell you this is one hypothesis one model that may contribute. I'm not doing your service but nevertheless are some very interesting cell culture and mouse observations that imply that there's a whole lot going on a different level. So this is a particular study that was not in 2013. So pretty recent and once they discovered that a cholesterol product called 27 hydroxy cholesterol is made in the liver. It's actually made it is made in the liver. It's one of these bile acid, you know, we might showed you the bile acids are made from cholesterol is it's a it's a product of those Pathways and it seems to to act  Sort of like an estrogen it's called an estrogen disruptor an endocrine disruptor and it acts like a an a type of estrogen it can buy those receptors and it's thought maybe that helped contribute to certain cancers that are estrogen-sensitive is that's been known as it'll be city is particularly prone to increase the risk and the out, decrease the good outcomes of certain breast cancers an interesting idea. Okay, so cholesterol products cause breast cancer is contributory. I know it's a hot. So here's another interesting one. This is incredibly interesting is that another study showed that the microbiome can take excess cholesterol and produce a toxin collate deoxycholic acid actually causes the increased amounts of these products from the food supply.  Diets can actually be the wrong microbial organisms can actually contribute by making things as well. So the main point of this is there's a lot of interest in specific molecular models and their importance studies but no one yet has come up with like the thing that causes he's in probably the difficulty is there isn't a thing. There's a whole bunch of things that contribute just like, you know, you need 5000 phytochemicals in a beta carotenoid diet and you get benefit, you know, you have 25 different. I'm good things happening when you eat a nutrient for high-fat diet all contributed. That doesn't mean that doesn't mean it shouldn't be looked at. It just means one has to look at it with it with a grain of what lipid, you know, anyone mechanism people come up with that one mechanism that that explains a disease and that's great and it's always good to look for those but it's also always good.  Look for something as complicated as all of the pathology. It happens in a public health situation. People are bases. Probably more than one thing or not. That's all I want you to just like Mendel facts and they taught us about at least chromosomes and DNA and genetics many many many interesting genetic things are far more than a multiple effects. Okay. So another really important and interesting idea about obesity is that it causes a state of inflammation not state of information is a pretty general term, but it needs a general activation of numerous immune cells that release cytokines released signals that activate the both innate and acquired immunity is this is actually review from Ron Evans is over at the salt and he's a major thinker in insert of the the molecular biology if you will have obesity and exercise really interesting guy.  And they actually put a little article together saying that obesity and inactivity together contribute to a state of a of information. So another thing about being obese, you know, having extra weight is it harder to do exercise in the motivation is lower. It's more challenging. It's you know, it even can be detrimental physically, you know, like I have friends. I have a friend who's wrestling with his weight and you know, it's really hard for him to find motivation personal cuz he feels shy to go to the gym cuz your hair the gym everyone looks awesome, except you.  It's really I totally get that. You know, we all have to be empathetic. I put also if you have extra weight and you might go out for a run and you don't you're not super careful about in this is also some of the old age if you're old like me if I started a new exercise, even the most subtle repetition of it. I will hurt myself the next day because as you get older like I started a weight lifting program at home and I do like three reps the next I do for reps like I'm up for like 16 or 17, but it's taken months because I'm rude don't want to hurt myself. So in the same way in on this is but this information thing is really interesting to the basic idea. Is it these two things together which often go hand in hand. So, you know obesity Indian activity often amplify each other in Act  Liberty creates a sense. That's we'll talk about it less energy usage per day off in the same eating habits sometimes more, you know, and those things can work together. And so do you get this really interesting and I just put this text you from your study. I'm not going to read it to you. But basically there are a number of different diseases that are you know enhance by estate of information. So some of them are you know, what did besides I can release a number of things that will a number I'm about to call the different kinds and signaling molecules that decrease insulin sensitivity immune cells can release a number of things that cause atherosclerosis in any way people think this has along with the cholesterol and uptake component. It also has ending in m u and an information component to it's a state of information up your brain cells can you know Kenny can be affected by the immune to a good friend of mine when I grew up with his actually finding his connections between innate immunity and Alzheimer's that are really interesting.  Let you know when these things are all of a piece and then systemic and local increases in cytokine castrations can change the outcomes of cancers in the propensity to Alden. I mean one of the way we think about cancer now, is that who knows if this is true, but there's pretty good evidence that we are constantly getting cancer and our immune systems are constantly dealing with it. Just like, you know, people are always getting pulled over on the highway you go glad it's not me. She was always somebody getting arrested and you know, it's in the same way cancers always popping up and that's that's the immune surveillance model and so altering the immune system especially for long periods of time with poor diet, you know, it makes some sense that there could be a component that again that's not the answer. It's a question, you know, but it's a reasonable contributor to that okay to another another really important.  Component of the Obesity epidemic is stroke for stroke is in a cerebrovascular accident that happened in the brain. And so this is actually I'm pretty amazing Parramatta. This is a county-by-county obesity map which is pretty that we can have this much data. I can assure people that want to be very analytical. They just want to skim the surface of things and find out this and then tweet that and the fact that we have these deep understanding things like every single County and there's a lot of counties in the United States is a county, right? And so so that's the Obesity and counties in the the darker the square the higher the percentage and other assorted distribution and that's stroke and it actually overlays pretty well. I know it's not that simple but it's pretty remarkable how you know how much it overlays like that in and it's actually a whole field of data analysis in which people study Geographic  Overlays of data it's it's a major you can study and even Advanced degree on an understanding geological and Geo mapping data and it's there's a whole set of tools and bossy no sensing and senses and you know, sometimes it's geographical. Sometimes it's sociological but it's a very incredible map of New York with type 2 diabetes and then another map overlaid of socio socioeconomic level and it's incredible how much the people who don't have any money 10 to get type 2 diabetes for very good reasons because of the food supply. So that's just a simple example. This is another example like that, you know, so in a one of the questions that arises it's super important is to what extent Do genetics play a role cannot help us understand these kinds of questions like a major question is why doesn't everyone who's obese get type 2 diabetes.  A lot of people do your race. They're your risk is much higher. Why doesn't everybody another question will talk about little late in life is why do some people who are normal weight get type 2 diabetes and what's going on with that? Is there a way to understand all that so turns out there so just amazing studies on genetics and model organisms in humans and it is quite clear. This isn't the least bit surprising because you know, we can't afford constantly to live that there's a number of different genes that directly affect energy balance and and obesity. So there's a Bible studies on mice do this is actually this was a cover of nature about 10 years ago. I read this is really exploding maybe 15 years ago. And this is a Turk certain kind of mouth called an open house. So it has one gene that stench obesity and when both when both copies of that Gene is mutated in my skin incredibly incredibly huge is also a mouse called ebdb for diabetic.  And when that mutant that single Gene is mutated does my snot only get enormously huge but they also get mouse type 2 diabetes poor glucose tolerance and not surprisingly those two genes are in the same signaling pathway dbno beer the same in the same path adjust to widgets in the same molecular machine interesting. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as simple as 1 or 2 G's we'd be we'd be on our way to answers instead of questions. You know what these these kinds of important? I thought we would stop there and I've got some questions here.  Why is Arizona so healthy compared to other states? And I think it's you know, if it's a it has to do with a lot of who lives there moving socio-cultural socio-economic in a California is pretty good though. So California actually state number 48 in the most recent in the groceries. When does the way that that is distributed across the body for obese people affect we're going to talk about that a beautiful leading question. Whoever wrote that thank you. Okay. Now, you know what comes next quickhatch we're going to do a little bit of quick ring.  You're also nice to come here or 7th inning stretch.  Got a little time.  We're good.  great, rainy  I know how many calories I eat a day.  Yes, I have a good idea is wrong.  Okay, the trackpad is not behaving well, sorry.  Yes, I have a good idea. No, I have no idea.  Which is it?  pure curiosity  you got about 10 years before you have to worry, but then you start knowing this.  Okay, I'm stopping.  Most people have no idea how many calories do today?  And I bet you it's interesting. It's actually more than I thought do I didn't I didn't think it I thought I'd be much for skewed interesting. I have to ask you more about that. Later.  Kmart  is absorbed more easily than mineral iron is absorbed less easily than mineral iron is a straight class info question.  Okay.  Okay, you hangers-on you can click now.  Yay. Yes, it's heme iron is absorbed more easily. This is why meat and muscle even the lowly clam is a better or more facile source. Is that a better Source? You just have to be shrewd if you're going to eat mineral iron. I mean instead of the heme iron, okay.  Liver function intestine function brain function thyroid function. I don't want you to lawyer up on this go well because of this then also that just what's the most what's the best answer? I don't need a lawyer's answer. I need a scientist in. Okay. What's the best answer?  best dancer  Okay, we're getting close.  The numbers are dwindling is a spring Porter's almost over people just burnt out. I'm going to stay in my dorm room today.  Play some first person shooters, okay?  Bloom very going to look at Sebring purple like iodine. That is so cool. It's a complete accident. Okay, good. Yes. The main thing I had eyes for is only making a T3 and T4 this timer on my switch to affect much of metabolic functions. That's why I said the lawyer thing as you can well, I'm at a bit of the liver. This is the primary function is thyroid now, there's a few interesting statements here. I will read to you. Okay a great book about the food industry is the Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan great book. Michael Pollan is a premier what you calling food journalist really awesome and he has like TED talks and website so you can get Taste of him without having to read a whole book.  What kind of physiological metabolic changes occur? When an obese person lose weight that is the million-dollar question people have all sorts of statements about metabolic rate changing metabolic rate testing the same eating habits drastically increasing appetite increasing. It's a giant with one of the things we know is most diets that work people lose the weight and then gain it back. There's a there's an idea called the set point and the set point is the point of the weight that you're going to have that set without any sort of intervention. Not only doesn't climb with aid but it also is very hard to change and then this is the beautiful question. We don't know an answer to that. You should really watch this one on her documentary called set up like FedEx fed up I have but you guys going to watch to do is come even write that down cuz this is  Add okay and it's a it really depicts why the United States is facing this obesity epidemic or at least the pics one way does the weighted fat as we've been over that? Why is Arizona? Okay. Good. Are there any real life questions and real-world questions or what? Would you call it? The meats beer? Okay, Carry On  So, you know, I showed you those mice and actually my younger my older brother when I was a kid had one of those mice we went to the Pet Shop weeds, but I bought a white mouse about a gold mask. It turns out his gold Mouse Tsum the shape of a tennis ball. It was a most amazing thing and I was so jealous cuz you can hold in your hand with a warm and big and just if I said, I want one of those skinny ass wipe now so, you know, it is like this big old enough and it turns out that's not a coincidence coz the same pituitary axis. It makes melanocytes stimulating hormone, which makes their color and Alta calidad that was an agouti Mouse also affects the energy balance through a number of hormones. So this actually made perfect sense. We had bought a mutant Mouse one of these obesity is not knowing it and Maximilian that was his name was the greatest mouse ever like you could push him like a hockey puck he would slide because he was so round and he was the best I still was nice to my house, but I always remember Maximilian was just  It literally was shaped like this. I'm kid you not it was like a circle and we just fed him seeds like we fed him healthy stuff. That's basically with Max and Lee and look like so amazing Mouse awesomeness. Okay, but the good news is or the interesting uses. This is the other question to come as well. There's Mouse genetics and NW master degree city is a very active field because there's a lot going on at there's all sorts of things behavioral controls. There's energy balance controls appetite control that are all have been parse genetically is an end because we're like 95% identical the mice in terms of primary sequence and proteins. We use there's a lot of information to glean like mice are an incredibly great tool for studying a lot of physiology especially since we can now manipulate them asking with phenomenal ability like Turnigy non in one tissue at one time and development knockout or altering Gene in any tissue.  I mean, it's actually really refined and that's great. But the question always is what we don't have to do with humans and humans in particular or problematic because unlike my AC on every single Mouse is a clone now, they are absolutely identical in which is great for getting data. But if you notice something if you read a mouse paper even with clonal animals, okay, so this is a little bit of a lesson you'll see a mouse Teddy with clonal animals here, maybe some effect like this in this mule Sierra bars like this affect absolutely identical genetic animals in identical cages and yet it was often see variability like that. So it makes one wonder, you know, what was you and be like where every every few hundred base pairs were different from each other in order to have a massive amount of variety. Like just look at everyone everyone in this room looks totally different in one very minor read out of our incredible differences, right? So is there  Uses for this is actually I will show you a few studies and this is a remarkable study for New England Journal of Medicine in 86 before some of you were a good idea. I think that's 96 2006 many of you were in a good idea. Right? So I'm so this is New England Journal of Medicine that can be so what they did in this particular case is a founding it was a Danish study where they found a huge a large number of adopted children and they said they found adopted children where they knew who the biological parents were, you know, not to substitute a cohort to adopted children male and female or they know the the biological parents or could find out about the biological parents. And so what they did is they said how does the Obesity weight classes of the adopted children map to their biological parents and their adoptive parents as the adoptive parents are providing the environment the feeding all the stuff in the biological parents.  Racine for providing the jeans that's a really kind of clever idea. Now, you know, it's going to be kind of nasty day look like this. What is in a what is the trans are pretty clear. So this is this is the biological parents. So this is the adoptees weight class and this is comparing it to the biological parents to see you see as the adoptees get big the biological parents are big and this is wobbly data, but it's clearly a trend what's amazing is when you take the adoptive parents use the ones who raised the adoptees but didn't provide any jeans is really no trending at all. And it did the significances about is less than 200 or one very significant difference. So this is a very clever, you know study and with no obvious flaws in terms of collecting the data and and figure out what's going on. There's no mechanisms it all but it clearly indicates that there's a genetic component. Okay.  And this isn't shocking cuz we now know you know, I mean b studies came before a lot of those incredible Mouse studies, but you know what, I'll make some sense. Okay. So this I'm not going to this is actually a long description of what they found out and I'm not going to read it to the class, but I will include it in the kids. Is it a little sort of summary statement? This shows you the size of the studies R O I know okay here so is like 540 a Danish adoptees from a population of 3500 cuz they wanted to adopt these were they knew something about the biological parents? And this is the kind of data that is highly significant data and forefathers. It was less. So interesting. So the mothers seem to correlate better than the father's interesting who knows what that's about could be epigenetic and could be you no intrauterine differences are you know facts it's not clear, but now it's obvious things. I want to tell you about another story very famous story called The Pima people there are often called the Pima Indians, but we will  You see that up a little bit and called the team of people. They were the first nation has hear the Canadians call their native the First Nation people. I love that. I think that's really a neat I need term but the Pima lived in this region of the Sonoran Desert between Arizona and Mexico and although it's not really that related to this particular study to Pima people had an absolutely amazing culture right before 1400 what happened in 1400? So before that or 1560 I had an absolutely incredible culture. They had Aqua systems water delivery because they live here in the Sonoran Desert. So that's a much younger. Randy has Randy from many years ago when I had hair and dark hair, but I was driving through the Sonoran Desert with a friend of mine and a we were heading to Grand Canyon and I said we leave it on to get a picture of this cuz it's just such a harsh environment and the Pima Air actually did beat the native.  Name for the p.m. From their language means the river people and they live near rivers whenever possible and irrigated nevertheless the Pima are very important Genetic Resource because they are amazingly prone to obesity and diabetes amazing. It's all I want you to remember this picture as we think about why that might be okay. So the Pima the average adult onset diabetes in the United States, if you take the whole populations 9% Pima of Southwestern USA at 50% So they 50% of the Pima who just, you know, living in the United States get type 2 diabetes, which is a crazy high number. Okay, 95% of people with non-insulin dependent Diabetes Type 2 diabetes are obese. So they're just very very high level of obesity. Very high-level type 2 diabetes when compared to the same, you know control populations in the same thing.  But we know they were always like that and so it's kind of amazing is this is a a cultural control experiment built-in is cheers United States here is Mexico in the Sonoran Desert just goes this way. It doesn't know no borders and there were especially, you know, the 40-50 a hundred years ago when this piece that he started about 50-60 years ago people could find Piedmont people who were living more in the sustenance driven diet. That was like the one they evolved with you know, and so we can do that if you compare it. It's a whole different animal cells are in Arizona to BMI. 33.4 diabetes 54 37% in Arizona in Mexico the exact same genetic pool. The BMI is 24.9, which is normal, you know, relatively normal. Remember that the small numbers are big changes. I sure do the table and diabetes is 6% 11 % near the near the average is that you see so it's all about where they were living, you know, so if you weigh to think about this  Pima have a particular cuz most of the people living in Arizona don't have those numbers. Right don't you take this group and a certain genetic predisposition and move them into a place where the diet is what we're used to you know, the industrialized Americanized High productivity low cost.  Hi macronutrients micronutrients diet and you get really an incredibly obvious change in the response. So it's a set of genes that alter the response to the environmental input of this is Nuance. This is the kind of big thing about so this is this the same I don't know why that's that is there so it's come up with this idea called the Thrifty Gene model. And the reason I don't like the Thrifty did they thought of this? I think this action to Pima have been studied by thousands of different researchers for a decade and when it's kind of interesting and important now is this is no doubt the Pima there Pima members of the Pima tribe who are being having a genome sequence in this will be very interesting to see what that is. But I promise you it will be a very noisy and every won't be out here is the gene is going to be a whole bunch of jeans, but Meg someday came up with us a vehicle the Thrifty Gene the Thrifty Gene Theory and it's a terrible name because it sounds like there's one.  Is there a Thrifty jeans and maybe even a 50g no understand about the Sonoran Desert and other environments that humans have been through these are places. Where is very easy to end up in a famine that picture of when people used to live there still. Do you can't believe it or if you go to Lake Powell in Utah. What the Four Corners is this beautiful Lake that used to be a river that they plugged up. I don't know if that's good or bad. What's a neat place to go houseboating on and you can have both are in the summertime. It's about a hundred and fifty degrees. You just lie on the houseboat and every hours are you roll off into the water? And then you get this very decadent you do that and the night sky is beyond belief cuz it's so clear is wrong with the water. Get back out sleep. That's what you do, but if you can  Wim bear and you find these amazing order called tarot eclipse in the rocks and then he's beautiful native drawn drifts things like this and that and there's all these cool symbols and stuff. The terrorists are easy to find many people live their thousands of years. It was actually a kind of native called the Anasazi and this is really cool the Anasazi or name that the later native gave me that it means the ancient people said they were people so so old that they were like, how did they draw those? Do they have chalk? That's pretty awesome that there's that sort of layer of a no one really knows anything about the Anasazi except. They probably came through the Bering Strait like the rest of us are the rest of the First Nation, but the fact is the Sonoran Desert is a place where you can cut constant very severe famine and the effect that is brutal as it sounds as you will gradually select for people who can survive that better and important than you realize.  Very small changes in Fitness a one or two percent difference in that kinda tea and having offspring that survive will add up over the generations to very big changes in the genetics. And if you've taken build three or population tonight reprise know more about this than I do but there's you know, it's it's really basically human variability is the allelic envelope is like a deck of cards is shuffled by Fitness changes. And so, you know, this is a beautiful example, these people have been through many many many many cycles of famine and they've developed jeans that are you allowed at survival, which is awesome when your sustenance farming with your canals in irrigation and your healthy food that you forward and grow and move around all day to get but it's very bad. When you move to, you know, Phoenix, Arizona and go to McDonalds everyday the problem and the people are just a particularly Amplified version to that. All right. So the idea might be understanding what that's about. There's other mechanisms now, there's a whole new aspect of obesity. That's just a reason  Five or seven years ago on the microbiome. So I keep mentioning the microbiome and I'm a big fan of them because I truly think it is going to revolutionize. It's just medicine but mammalian biology it is it is just a completely and me we've known that the gut is full of microbes for decades but no one really knew the extent to which the microbiome effects an incredible number of different physiological parameters, including things like mood your tendency to respond to exercise harvesting calories. So there's some really importance that is going on and now they'll do things like again with mice you can play games or you can take the microbiome of one Mouse clear the microbiome from another and transfer that you can you can transplant the microbiome. It's very easy to do you just feed a the poop from be my son seem to mind that so nicely packaged and and then you can see them a gram and you can play a game.  Psychic obese mice and see the microbiome from them into normal mice and they grow will be sending us a really amazing incredible filled hole. So you could teach the observations has been made into on 2013 for a while ago is that it seems to be a correlation BB microbial complexity in the gut and tendency to get metabolic disease to get into the kind of things. It'll be City makes you sick with. Okay. So as the microbiome gets less complex is a higher Tennessee to have metabolic disease risk. Now. This is unfortunately a chicken-and-egg problem is it's not clear whether the habits that cause, you know, obesity lower the diversity of the microbiome the otherwise but when you have interventions that decrease the weight bird of the BMI, you see micro micro Bill complexity going out this though, they're very deeply connected. But only reason I mention this to you is that  Is that it's a whole other aspect to think about is the microbiome and its role of the microbiome Harvest calories for us and sometimes it Harvest them effectively and sometimes he eats them, you know, the microbiome pretty all kinds of I guess they be called microbial microbial products. You know, we the one we talked about was propionic acid, which is made that affects. Asthma these short chain fatty acid. This is one example just probably thousands of molecules in microbial produces and it depends which ones are there, which organisms are there and how they're talking to each other and how they're processing each other's molecules that affect that's real interesting Frontier. Okay, so you don't hear another a special case where they have a very Amplified system to respond to these dietary incursion, but the bottom line is you have to move from you know, the Sonoran Desert Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona to start seeing the effects on the beam of people so that says there's something else going on this independent from them and that is definitely  I need the food supply. Okay. So the food supply in the United States has increased in the dollars per calorie have gone way down. It is amazingly cheap to eat calories in this country, you know, and that actually has many important aspects if you are a two working parents and you have three kids and you have no time. Maybe you're working two shifts, you know feeding your kids quickly and cheaply is unbelievably important in tempting, you know, if there's a there's actually a guy Robert lustig who said it was a sort of this sugar evangelist I've talked about and he's a pediatric physician at UCSF musically interesting guy. He did a remarkable video that's been watched about I think 220 million times and he actually has left his post as a pediatric physician and going to law school so he can help change policy because he believed so spend that there aren't many people who do  How do you know you're a physician at UCSF and you're famous, you know when things are going well and people are listening to you and you're ready books. Not many people would drop that to go to law school to be a kind of more Adept at policy-making in that language. I think that's super impressive and it says a lot to me about the person sincerity. Okay course doctors lawyers in US per capita. Just the number of calories per day to kick in soon goes as gone from like to 2250 and 1972 2800. They might go up satellite. That's a lot when it's everyday. Okay. I want you to remember that a pound of fat is about 3,000 calories in calories. So if you're increasing calorie consumption by 550 a day  You had that up / 365 days a year. That's a lot of change in energy intake. Okay, and then there's also these these these sociological aspects. So there was a 32 years. Harvard to UCSD together then ask the question. What are people's you no social connections. How does that affect obesity and eating habits in this makes perfect sense. You don't have to be some kind of you know Noam Chomsky to think it is is if you hang with your friends usually eat, but they're eating at the places. They're eating. It's like I'll just have water I need a box to put half of my meal in the box. So I don't eat too many calories are in a box to do the same and it's fine. It's fine to go to a place and everyone or does he have a Mio? It's like meals are an incredibly important part of the way, we socialize which isn't shocking because it's how we all stayed alive, right? So it's  That you can get a 50% 57% increase in obesity risk of a friend becomes obese just me or did they just survey this and you can get 171% increase if they close mutual friend becomes obese and the 30 for $0.07 if a spouse becomes will be so I don't know what the numbers mean spouse vs. Friend that you'd hope someone spouses their friend, you know, it's a special kind of friend, but what's interesting is they found no increase if the if a neighbor begin will be so someone is in proximity that you know, you see everyday it's about the social network intriguing and I think it's so you have a combination of the tendency for people to amplify each other's behaviors plus the food supply big big thing. Why doesn't Ruby spouse have such a low if I could be different? This is where I don't know. I haven't read this study and it ain't no it's it's not clear that that's not clear and you think spazzes usually eat together. So I don't know good question. You've generated question is lawsuit.  From biocomplexity reversible. Yes. Apparently it is one of the things they want to know is when the people get become less obese lose some weight the microbial complexity changes, but this is Frontier stop. This isn't like not super well known why is grapefruit said to be a fat burner out of sugar and I don't think that's the most fat burners are like done by someone who's taken freshman biochemistry and then made a supplement in dollars. It's like there's never very few actual fat burners and that there may be none. There's one fat burner that were super well as run 10 miles a day, but you will then that would eating as we'll talk about in a sec. Okay, so there's two major changes in the food supply come from two sources, and I know a book enough with the books Randy, but these are two absolute  Amazing books after you read how not to die. These are the other two books. You should read before you come a dog become a doctor. That's all I'm saying is they're both really interesting. So this is an older book called fast food nation is came out I think 10 or 15 years ago in DC solutely fascinating and grits gripping. It's almost like a novel about the change from Little mom-and-pop restaurants to the food supply being entirely fast food and it is and it's actually incredible stories about the single Visionary entrepreneurs who said it'd be great to be able to serve people food in their cars cuz everyone's busy with post World War II 1940-1950 ruins. I'll crank up. Yay. That's that's good jobs and let's make things and do things and build phones and computers and go to the moon and all that stuff and along with that came this very reasonable idea to deliver tons of cheap food to people and it is just all levels of Industry all levels of Commerce.  All levels of diet and health is amazing. This book will change your life. I really think about this is the restaurant version. This is the grocery version to this book came out more reason, I think about 2007 and Michael Moss won a Pulitzer Prize. I have a funny story have a very dear friend named Randy you grew up in New York is a filmmaker. He was in the subway one day. He passed out you fell over. He didn't have good health and this guy Michael Knox picked him up and brought him to the hospital. It's complete coincidence, but I just crazy story. I showed Randy this putting that guy save me about about the food industry both at the Restaurant level and the grocery level are incredibly important books to read they really are okay.  One particular nutrient or macronutrient is sugar a carbohydrate and the fact is one of the script one of these trying to understand is how did all this happen so fast, how did it happen from 1940 up to you know current day. This is very in terms of genetics is very short time. So one thing that's clear is over the last century so longer times sugar consumption is just go on gargantuan. Okay. So in the 1820s, we ate a few pounds of sugar a year and humans at most a pound of sugar a year if they were rich. I can't text you. It was so rare. You can see go to museums and see these sugar balls that have a lock on them. This is true. So that be the help wouldn't steal the sugar like it was that precious and invaluable complete separate hyperlink. There is an incredible socio-cultural history and Geo cultural history just sugar so it getting sugar to the tune of  200lb a hundred pounds a year from 1 pound a year required an absolutely massive and brutal slave trade that occurred between Europe Africa and the Caribbean and this is actually worth learning about because then we pay a very high price for all the sugar we liked in terms of our cultural history whole separate issue not important here, but the fact is that we eat a huge amount. So we evolve eating sugar way down here are livers are pancreases are not equipped to handle this or maybe there's a subset maybe it'll be a people of a subgroup of uber sugar people, you know, we're not a hundred five hundred years from now, they will have they will need to eat a pound of sugar a day to be maximally healthy, but for us many of us are feeling the effects of this. Okay, and it's worth going into now that sugar is cheap and easy to make going to CVS when you're waiting on line with your one item and someone has 56 item cuz for some reason the other grocery shopping CVS was crazy you can watch and you will see there's like $19,000.  Purple items that you can get right there. It is everywhere everywhere. And so what are the sources of added sugar most of the added sugar, fruit chutney main source of added sugar ranked by frequency with which it's consumed. This is all persons. And this is a 2-2 18 years and this is actually amazingly similar between you think I'll kids eat all the candy. We all eat the same things but it's soda and sports drinks an energy drink. So, you know what the sugar in them and you just tastes worse than Coke, you know it and so this is actually it's I want to talk a little bit about that the sugar industry and so it turns out there's been a actually The Gates Foundation today and Analysis of all the ways that mortality and lethality and disease are impacting on the world. Like what are the major determinants of illness on our planet like this is a huge  Millions of people and one of the most important components with sweet Beverages and Sugar by coming from sweetened beverages. It's a completely different way to have diet and the dietary factor is most likely to predict against obesity an illness or high consumption of dietary fiber fruits and vegetables. So plant-based Whole Foods and I'll be the answer is actually the one our grandmothers used to tell us. Okay, so I'll know my grandmother used to make these awesome sugar cookies full of butter. And so I don't know if she was completely innocent in this and I used to look forward to Grandma coming to visit cuz of those cookies but this is not simply a problem of these these these beverage Industries doing this and just innocently making something that they didn't realize is bad for us and that we're consuming too much even though they're not making a spy it is there are a bunch of examples of these sugar purveying companies suppressing or trying to alter the science.  I didn't reminiscent of the tobacco industry. So there's these incredible stories about the tobacco industry going to eat thanks to both fun scientist. It will prove something to test something or say something say something else as well as viciously suppressing and and assassinating the characters, even if certain of people in the Tobacco World setting tobacco pathology amazing Russell Crowe movie when she plays a real person who is to sort of hero of the tobacco Revolution, you know and end so there's a little quieter scale. This is been going on with sugar for years. Okay, and it's it's a whole other conversation. This is just one example is Coca-Cola fun scientist to shift blame for obesity away from Bad diets, and there's all sorts of amazing. Almost Nineteen Eighty-Four type propaganda about how awesome sugar is a great energy source, and I actually I taught a freshman seminar in Sugar which was really fun.  Newest students here. We talked about six socio-cultural in the medical in the commercial aspects of sugar and then we went on a field trip to the yogurt place on campus. It's getting some sugar but it's it's amazing how you can learn about the the overt suppression of information and the sort of propaganda campaign. It makes sense though, because these companies are multi-billion. This is a multi multi hundred billion dollar industry, you know, I'm that kind of money has power that is not obvious when you're in the middle of it, but it's very obvious when you start learning about it, and I know Angie industry, I'm not Auntie Corporation. I just think that understanding with really going on is a challenge to all of us, especially tomorrow's doctors and wellness people. So it's quite clear that there's clear wrist from sugar ingesting a sugary drink per day vs. No drinks increase the risk of heart attack fatal heart disease, like substantial increases the risk stroke type 2 diabetes and  Increase weight gain and sugary drink a day now. So how much do people drink? So this is the amount of soda that the average American drinks in a year. So if these are those are those two gallon bottles in these are just cancel. This is the clever Graphics about 44.7 gallons a year of of soda pop. Okay, both diet and sugar diet pop has its own issues. But if you drank that much sugar that was regular you probably much worse off in the diet, but you know, probably the best thing to do is the artificial sweeteners are are problematic.  so  how do you measure obesity and adiposity and what can we learn from this? You know, this is something that we're thinking about and there's different ways to do it. So probably one of the classic ones you can try to get this done over the gym your coach might do this. It's very common is just called The Skin Pintor skinfold tests. So they basically squeeze the skin and the degree of adiposity has to do with the you know, the amount in the thickness of the skin sample you can pinch is real common is very easy to do there's charts and tables another waste away people underwater which is kind of a pain you need a big tub Harbour need to get in the water and you can weigh them to get an idea of their buoyancy, you know, you get a density basically a water density in a solvent and City and there's public health chart to figure that out. This is actually amazing is called the bod pod. This is a very expensive very accurate device to tell you precisely what your body's volume is. So it uses different acoustic signals in it in a reference chamber.  And in a in a regular what's going on here? I'm losing it.  Is this working?  My God, okay. I'll have to do this so here so it has a reference chamber and it measures basically your physical volume. This isn't working damn hundred bucks down the tube. Okay, then be very best way to measure in this is probably something is going to become more and more comments for the dexa scan that stands for a dual energy X-ray and sorbitol mepps Comet re-absorption tree. So it's a and basically you just to wavelength of x-rays shot through you and the difference in absorption is a very good indication of body composition bone density faster. This is the kind of Graphics you are the different types of tissues are are indicated and sorcery very accurate indication of a bone density. So I got it you can get a dexa scan at the at a park here for about a hundred bucks. And also there's this amazing. I'm company called they called.  They're called on someone actually texting me about the they're coming as a mobile dexa scans and they also do mobile oxygen and CO2 respiration ratio. So you can get all the sports and wellness information from those that truck whatever it is. And so this is another way to do it, but they're so subtleties that actually emerges when you start thinking about this body composition. So some of the subtleties that are really important to think about I'm really sad, my thing isn't working a way to start to work again. Oh my God. It's back. So you just needed a rest. Everything's okay. We love you. You're doing great. Okay, so I'm not everyone with a high BMI has metabolic disorder. Like why is that, you know, even the Pima so, you know if substantial fraction do but not all of them, right? Okay. There are people with normal BMI who have metabolic disorders who have the, you know panoply of like glucose and sensitivity and I mean insulin sensitivity poor glucose tolerance High triglyceride high LDL low HDL.  Talk about that. So these exceptions require better understanding the pathological mechanisms or so. They're really what we want to get at. These are the questions those answers are going to be interesting and important. Okay. So one of the things has become clear is that not all fat on the body is identical. So one of these very simple measurements is the waist circumference in terms of the waist circumference is an indicator for a marker of a certain type of fat that turns out to be extremely important physiologically and pathophysiologic lie, so it turns out the waist circumference is a easy Public Health Clinic a way to access the two assessments called visceral fat. So miserable fat is fat instead posited in organs not out on the surface. So there are people who can be very slim who have a high visceral fat. There are marbled like a rib-eye steak would be to think about it and older people get more marbled. Also. My numbers aren't great. So I think I might be one of these peep.  But anyways, cuz I have a lifetime of eating crappy food and only now cuz of his class in my change a house full of seeds in oranges and apples and fruit flies, but it turns out that you have subcutaneous fat and visceral fat and subcutaneous fat is much less dangerous for us. So this is one way so there's actually some really interesting articles were people started realizing as this person ask. I'm on that on the text that the that where the fattest Deposit Insurance have to be super important in ways. We don't totally get yet. So if you have normal adiposity adiposity just the degree of fat normal adiposity. This is a cross section of a person just like, you know, visually, okay and then you start eating energy dense food you have Palatka physical activity and one of the things that happened you start gaining adipose tissue and soap normal gain about a post-racial happens on the outside, you know, the big classic role that you might  Okay and visceral adiposity you'll notice it is better that has gotten bigger. But the outside hasn't changed either extreme cases. Usually it's a mix of both and usually people the high BMI have high Elder in a subcutaneous adipose and it's visible and high visceral. So there's not like one of the other but these are the two different sort of circumstances and it turns out that that visceral adipose visceral obesity is correlated with all sorts of problems because you get fat deposited in tissue where it's not the only supposed to be this is also called back topic fat. So ectopic just means in the wrong place X topic means it's in the wrong place or out of the normal place, you know, and so you have fat deposits in muscles change the muscles response to to exercise and Insulin you haven't you have  Your epicardial fat around the heart that alters the response of the heart to stresses and improves increases the rate of atherosclerosis. You have you have liver fat that drastically altered liver function can even cause some of these pathologies we talked about. Where is the E on the organs it when there's no ectopic fat function normally even in the cases of obesity straight obesity from pathological obesity. Okay, and so one of the interesting is visceral fat causes increased risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes breast and colon cancer hypertension a metabolic syndrome to all of these things are contributed by some these are studies were they measuring people's visceral fat using dexa scanning mostly or other measures? So the waist circumference is one way to get at so did this is ended up being that instead of thinking about BMI, which is still a very useful Public Health in the first thing you'd want to ask a patient, especially if you were interviewing in my computer on the phone is what  What's your weight was your height to help you think about that but that's not the end-all something. Like fifty million Americans have a condition with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Do this is called metabolic syndrome. So this is something that you know that you're going to hear more about it. If it's a group of risk factors that that's that spell bad news. So one of them and abdominal obesity especially being pear shaped as opposed to being apple shape of us a pear shape. That's what they say. Cuz that's a better indicator of visceral adiposity high blood glucose resting high blood glucose for insulin sensitivity high blood pressure high LDL low LDL insulin resistance glucose intolerance to do some kind of a test on them. But some of these early indicators are one blood test and dust very useful to sort of, you know, bin people into a problem areas. So how do we expend energy?  You know, how does how is this done?  And or why do we think about energy expenditure? And so this is actually pretty simple equation for energy expenditure is basal metabolism. That is just your rest of the metabolism that you and you yourselves are always cracking H-E-B to the tune of 70 kg a day. You're turning over a TV use energy to keep your molecular shit together and I'll keep your DNA may keep your proteins made to keep making new ones keep replacing Parts all that stuff if you do physical activity and it's incredibly wonderful idea of the thermic effect of food. The thermic effect of food is the energy cost of eating and digesting food. If only it's a very small fraction of total energy, but it is a real thing about 10% of the energy you spend comes from processing the food you eat. So if only there were food that had a hypothermic coefficient you could eat and burn more but that's not going to happen. So those are the three components and it turns out that people have thought hard about. You know, what the basal metabolism is in this is incredibly important because when we eat that three  400 calories extra day that came from between 1970 and 2000. This is how many calories do I need a day? So this is actually been studied by a number of people in this equation by Harris and Benedict and they do this a lot of 1918. This is like before my parents were a good idea. It was a long time ago and they basically 20 30,000 people. You know, what looks like this cock. I have one minute here. Let me just finished harris-benedict. I promise I won't keep you from the satellite watch that I have right here. Is it basically did a study and they came up with an equation and this equation and we'll go in this next time really calculates for public health level what the the resting daily energy expenditure is as a function of body mass height and age. So those are the three things that again very simple but it changes with age. Okay, I think we'll stop there and we'll continue on Tuesday.  Great Memorial Day. "
