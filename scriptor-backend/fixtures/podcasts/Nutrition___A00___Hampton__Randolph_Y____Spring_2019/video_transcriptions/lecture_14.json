I need you all to be like really quiet for a second. You aren't quite anyways, we have to test the sound. Hold on. Hold on ready? Okay, it works. Okay. I'm going to show you a little video. I thought that would be fun. Okay, very good. Let's see snow and I I was in such a rush. I didn't even get to put a fun picture up. So it's a blank slide so k b r e grades are due today right now. This is the proverbial box from which in which you put your test in a box though. This be it. This is the box and after the end of class today. I'm not taking any more.  All right, and I say I'm about just looking at them to give you more credit. I'm not about scaring you into not submitting them. Okay the deal.  Okay, so and I will look at each of them. So I'll check them out myself, okay?  All right. Well, we'll text questioning were involved in this bold experiment with our text Master General Laura is doing a great job and you know, it's the safe and unabashed way to ask any question you like and I even go through them seems to be a lot of Rumble itch need you all to chill.  Take a deep breath pay attention only to the brat watch your thoughts, but don't think them okay.  Okay, so we doing that got a couple interesting questions.  So someone ask how do pregnant women prevent vitamin deficiencies before prenatal vitamins were introduced so like for the 300,000 years we were in existence before they were vitamin and the answer is you eat food Chanel Ali I'm not being cynical here is that is there plenty of very easy and direct ways to get all the vitamins weed and it's true that you know, when people don't have those supplements. It's very important to be correctly nourished because of developing embryo. That's a sort of you know, there are certain things that happened then and only then and they affect you for the rest of your life, okay?  Couple other someone asks question if B12 stays in the body longer why do vegans have such issues with B12 deficiency? It's a great question. Here's think that's exactly the problem you decide you read a book about plant-based diets, you read thousands of studies thing that that eating more plants and less means good or maybe eating only plants is good. And you decide you're going to be a vegan. All right, whatever reason and you stop taking vitamin B12. It's accidental. You don't know you didn't take nutrition hear. You're a physician. You've never heard a single lecture about nutrition and you don't know that vitamin B12 is missing from all plant-based sources and you go vegan and you lose some weight and you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and you lower your risk of cancer and you feel better and you look good and all your hip is friends think you're awesome because you're doing an Ethics based diet or you don't have any factory farming and there's thousands of cows and chickens and have a better life because you're not  Having them put through some sort of industrial process that raises them in microscopic cubicles, etc. Etc. Three years down the line. Suddenly. You start getting anemia. You start feeling bad for having all kinds of symptoms. You can put on plan face and I'm awesome. And exactly the reason is the B12 store is in your liver will last about three years so you can have an incredibly great diet and not even know it because this these stores are so long. So the person here actually highlighted the main issue is because people stays in the body so long that you can really have an issue with it and there's plenty of people have had to figure this out. So I thought that's interesting. Let's ask an actual vegan. So this is someone who was in my 102 class many years ago and they went on to go to UC Davis and I get a Veterinary degree Austin Veterinary and it's great to know a veterinarian. If you have a cat cuz you can just text him and go. Hey my cats doing this and I'll go he shouldn't be V.  And he's a cat and so I said question. I am teaching the class nutrition very interesting and then wondering how my smart vegan friends deal with a complete lack of vitamin B12 and also fully plant-based sources. What do you do our see we have a code on our and they went nutritional yeast and a multivitamin that uses like parmesan. You can put it on almost everything. So no yeast as we went over his sexy pretty tasty. I've had nutritional yeast sprinkle on popcorn. It's not that it is sort of like parmesan cheese. Not that. So there you go an actual vegan. Does it special place in both nutrition and pop culture answer to that bro science that we talked about that soda that weird interface of pop culture and actual medical science and actual science and has many interests. You could actually teach a whole class.  Effects of vitamin C very interesting and I think one of the features of it it has a very specific enzymatic function like other vitamins, but it also has many very general features is definitely an antioxidant it does oxidation reduction chemistry. So it has a lots of very poorly defined yet clear rolls in hell. I told his very specific roles in enzymology. So it's a very special Coat Factory. This is what it looks like. This is ascorbic acid ascorbate and this is the this is the oxidized form. So you noticed that 08 hear, you know, just like a lot of things we studied can do this can give up electrons. So it's a and if you can have a free radical existence, so it's a good antioxidant vitamin C is found in a lot of different plant sources fruits certain vegetables. It was not hard to get if you eat the right thing. Okay, and so then one of the main functions of vitamins  Is it's an important factor in a class of enzyme called Pro little hydroxylase has no race this little erase which is still here.  I'm very excited. I'm flying to Fargo North Dakota tonight to run a marathon on Saturday. What a great hobby. I'm kidding stupid.  So I'm but you know you get addicted this shit and then your doom. So here we go. So we're in here is a terms.  I still have never remember the photograph because I never ever ever remember. Yeah, I got an idea. Let's do this. Let's go.  Next contestant. This is supposed to be put your test in a box. It's a song.  Okay, Randy.  photograph  but you still exist really a phone digital copy, but we know what I mean photograph.  the effing  Armslist  I maybe this will make me do it and some ta has to erase this cuz we don't want to get any trouble.  I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.  Stands for fine. Fine turns was okay.  This is a really interesting enzyme. It's a collection of enzymes and they one of the main things they do is they modify college and now I don't know how much protein signs you have YouTube structure. Wild. You may be there in this is an incredibly important protein. It's really early would hold us together, you know, all the joints and connective tissue. We are basically held together by hydrogen bonds and Van Der waals interactions between tequila Siege of collagen and collagen unlike many protein Genesis is a triple helix and it's a triple helix because the proteins in it gets hydroxylated. It gives it a certain physical properties that allow it to do its structural think it's absolutely critical for Proline to undergo this hydroxylation. There's also seemed incredibly cool uses of proline hydroxylation in things like oxygen sensor, and we won't be talking about that but there's very neat uses of these enzymes in a lot of very fancy biology and so at score Bay  Is incredibly important. It's a cofactor just like the nadh is a cofactor when things get you know, if I drive into them damn tank, you know, what are you guys driving around and no one?  What's a water supply for one that somebody selling you some fancy equipment to drink water. So anyway, this is what the proline hydroxylase residue that should be in that. It happened to use. Alpha ketoglutarate is one of the other kobach that's not so important important as you have Proline here and hydroxypropyl in there to see how I know.  See that awake. This is the proline. This is hydroxide a probably ascorbate along with oxygen. It's a pretty fancy enzyme is absolutely need it for that. And so one of the places that deficiencies Hoops, the deficiencies are important is in things were when when vitamin C Runs Out you start being unable to replace college and you get all these incredible symptoms. So we'll talk about that. But the thing about vitamin C that makes it both interesting perplexing accident. So it's a free radical trap an aqueous solution people study the cabbages important in the I will you get free radicals from Portales is remember that beautiful I cycle with retin house is retinol trans right now. There's a lot of electrical and biochemical activity going on in the eye needs constant maintenance and one of the version of maintenance is trapping free radicals. Okay, another's in the immune system. We have a lot of reactive oxygen species that are made.  And so there's very high concentrations of vitamin C in both the eye and in white blood cells where it's important as an antioxidant. So that's where it's found in His Highest levels is in the eye and leukocytes and sew it. Also an agent iron absorption. So taking vitamin C helps other things get taken up for talking about and it's important in the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters are having lots of functions and body problem in always cause a lot of problems so high and low on vitamin C. You don't need a lot of it like 90 day for male adults 75 for female adults more for smokers fortunately. Most of you don't need to worry about that, but you may have patience or loved ones who you know, and the thing that's really amazing as you need any amount of it to avoid this disease scurvy that you probably all heard of its Sailors and other people are undernourished yet. It's only a day and you probably know people who megiddo see a lot of people take crap loads of vitamins.  And this is where the interesting sort of interface between pop medical culture and science and medicine interface. You know, I'm in I'm sure all of you have heard about people anytime someone gets the sniffles to take some vitamin C. I can buy my wife doesn't said I'd like I learned a long time ago. You can be happy or you can be right the last thing I want to get out as like the prospective. There's no need to go to XS bad. Is it? Okay. So I sleep in the garage and I'm right the upper limit that doesn't apply to science science is all about being right the upper limit access intake will not cure the common cold that is just absolutely not rather that be treated me as if you're a runner or any for some endurance hobbyist. I would hardly call myself an endurance athlete. I'm in endurance hobbyist.  Open you know, that kind of a hobbyist a cold is like absolutely ruins doing something like that. So very antique old but it's vitamin C. Just I went through my phase of mega dosing vitamin C when I got a little sniffle and it just takes about 3 days for it to go away. It's like really worked it took three days and went away away. Just dyed your head. Okay. Anyway, so vitamin C deficiency syndrome is a very serious thing though. And so do you get things like fatigue and pinpoint hemorrhages in a hair follicle? So this is actually a picture of normal skin and every one of those red dots as a hair follicle is hemorrhaging very painful. It's a very unpleasant and then the main the main symptom is scurvy which is a loss of collagen synthesis and it affects all sorts of tissues. You get bleeding gums teeth starting to fall out bone pain and eventually a slow wound healing and death. So now they're these abundant stories about scurvy.  Nautical exploration because because our water subdivide ones they take a month or two to start depleting. So you want a long voyage and it's it also the process that treated meats that that people brought along on these voyages would have low Vitamin C the either cuz they be cooked or or or treated with the right thing. So I'm in the combined effects or a million stories like this and I'm the most interesting when I've discovered recently is it's now thought that the first European Colony or the first European Village, it was started by Columbus and his men in which actually do to scurvy. They there's a site called loss Isabella which was the first settlement at the Akai the Colombians, I guess who called my Columbus's Sailors started and they tried to make it and they didn't than most of them died and that they have actually be paleo or these these historical archaeologists have found the sites examine the bones and it's quite clear that these people  Add scurvy it looks like the day actually and probably like that, you know, the indigenous people are like don't tell him about the corn and don't give them any fruit. Cuz these people are a problem. If you read about the Way Columbus Street of the indigenous people, I wouldn't give them food either. So it's there you go. You get what you reap what you sow, okay, but there's a kind of neat and it actually comes from this is Sheba the baby lion us and Saudi San Diego Zoological Park has been involved in in a really awesome as animal husbandry an animal in a rear against PC replenishment for many decades are in a century or more and so in nineteen forty-two this little lion was abandoned by its mom. I mean, it's the sweetest thing. I should get one for carbon and carbon but this is Chiva and she was adopted by the San Diego Zoo and did fine for a few months sounds familiar.  Start getting bleeding gums and was obviously in pain and couldn't move very well and they notice all the symptoms with exactly like scurvy. So everyone's always thought that cats can synthesize vitamin C because it only primates can't synthesize vitamin C, but it turns out that that that be so alpha predator cats need Vitamin C sources and they normally per day a lot more so they gave Sheba vitamin C and she was fine. I think it's kind of a nice story actually found it. The reference from 1942 showing is in the end of this is a third of a good Counterpoint to the whole Columbus Day. So it turns out that that primates are outliers in the vitamin C world and one of the things that had perplex people for a long time is that you have these nautical explorers getting terrible scurvy and they encounter these indigenous in which, you know previously called Eskimos, but that's considered a culturally insensitive terms of the Inuit art in the Arctic.  Whoever nothing but blubber at me and I was in their diets almost entirely meat and fat and dad are fine. And I'll get scurvy dog on the answer is those animals make more than enough vitamin C cuz they're not primaries to do it and that was sort of a realization. So it turns out that we are very special and our inability to make Vitamin-C know why that is one of the interesting things about evolutionary observations is it's always questioning is it Fitness or an accident? You know what that's always the question in evolution. Is there a fitness advantage to promise not making vitamin C or is it just an accident of the lineage of urging that we've had to live with and you know that it's a very subtle and interesting question, but for whatever whatever reason it occurred, all primates are united in their inability to make vitamin C. And so, you know, we're very good at forging. Yeah. We are we are adventuresome foragers.  People really haven't figured it out. So you may have heard that vitamin C cure the common cold and that was actually not true. But it was putting put forward by an absolutely brilliant a person from the 20th century named Linus Pauling and Linus Pauling is one of my science here. I was he literally took quantum mechanics and converted into something. Everybody can understand like, you know, what an ad in a p orbital is P2 in and you cry but it allows any of us to think about basically the quantum mechanics of molecular Bond formation intuitively, which is cuz the computations are those bond is area. If you've ever done any quantum mechanics, you don't have to have done much to go. Woah, this is Brittany complex. And so that gift of telling us how to think about orbitals of a simple weight is highly predictive in a highly nemonic to put in that way is the gift of Linus Pauling in the people he worked with and also all the protein structure of that. He did a lot of structural biology.  Peace Prize because he was very anti nuclear proliferation and early on figured out that this was something we need to have long conversations about in a lot of conversation. So, you know mazing guy but then the trouble is when you're a smart enough that everyone calls you an expert especially in sociology peace and science people are just going to nod their head when you say anything so, you know at he started going on this thing about vitamin C being unbelievably useful and important and powerful and yeah, I might be right beside a video. It's very confusing. It is not obvious and he did live to be over ninety. But anyway, I just this study came out from Linus Pauling and see his name there in 1971. They had this small study sing an intravenous high vitamin C return  Grams a day enter Venus help people with cancer help them live longer and maybe even you cured if your people this is the thinking cause a lot of excitement and neon. This is a scientist wanted Consul de Mayo Clinic conducted good double-blind studies and controlled studies on cancer patients and found there was no benefit but they did it orally so it's a long wait, but they didn't do the exact same thing. This is one of the frustrating things about being studies like this is so you can't just go back to the lab next week and do it. If we got to try it again, you know, it's especially if they've passed from cancer, you know, this is a problem. There's a number of cell culture studies. So there's been a number of studies with patients that have not panned out as you'll see a simple cell culture City. You can take cancer cells in culture dishes and show that vitamin c does all sorts of things to bollix them up and then there's these are just too.  Dozens and dozens of scientific paper showing the vitamin C added and culture cancer cells. Let's ask Michael Greger about this. So Michael Greger is actually a guy who does an absolutely amazing weapon. There was a lecture, but he has an incredible website called.  nutrition  Jesus nutrition facts one word  . Org  This is an amazing amazing sight nutritionfacts.org. And the thing I don't like about Michael Greger. That's absolutely amazing. And and really interesting. Is it in a board-certified physician Internal Medicine guy in a typical Doctor Who decided he really really really wanted to understand how nutrition impacts on health and medicine but you didn't want to do it through anecdote. He want to do it only by studying and reading the scientific literature. And the reason he got into this thing is as a child has an incredible story that he tells his grandmother had terrible congestive heart disease she was and she went to a doctor and they basically said you're going to die, you know, he knows she has terrible atherosclerosis and arteries in in a really sick could barely walk and she was I think 60 at the time and she went to a doctor who said that, you know you it's too late. You should take care of your affairs.  There's nothing we can do. She then went to another person who changed your diet. She and very way before this was Hep. She went on to a completely plant-based diet almost out of desperation cuz you know, there was some some observations that was the case and this lady live to be another 20 years older she lived into her eighties and she got better much faster and it just I don't know whether that what that's about but inspired him to say, what's that all about and to his frustration as a medical doctor going through the ranks of medical school and internship and having jobs, he notice it and no one ever ever thinks about nutrition and its impact on the health field on maintenance of hella fun. Helping people are sick on avoiding illness. So he started his Pioneer of of science-based Wellness. His mission has been to do nothing but study the literature of nutrition studies and nutrition science and see what we can extract from in and it's absolutely amazing that so the thing about this site,  Then you guys will like his you like, you know video Snippets tweets, you know, who books is challenging and I get it cuz we live in the ocean of information is all of these videos about 5 minutes long and there's over a thousand of them that he's made himself in man is possessive try that plant-based energy. He has he's a man possessed. He also went on the road giving talks everywhere. He could to the extent that he lost his first marriage which he talks about honestly because he was so driven to do this. And now this is stabilize any actually wrote an amazing book that I will show you a call. This is a great book on how not to die.  How not to die and basically he goes through all 50 major causes of death and describe all of the prospective retrospective case-control in a double-blind studies. He can find that address these different causes of death it is it will change your life right not going to read a book. I got plenty to read. Okay, if there's if you read one book this year One book this year read this book, especially if you want to be a physician, especially if you want to be a physician's assistant, especially if you want to be a nurse, especially if you want to be an osteopath, especially if you want to do anything that has to do with health maintenance trust me. It is incredibly readable incredibly interesting and the audible book is kind of fun to I'm listening to it while I drive I got to pull in the big top nevermind.  But I have this. Oh this this is why I like this this guy I like him because he he says, okay, what's the deal with the vitamin C situation and you will see how complex C's cities are in the okay. There you go, Austin, can you let you know the moment you said here's a moment I could do this. I'm not going to like hide the boxing class inside out. This is risky cuz it's you know the internet and let's see what happens. Can we get to it interesting facts. Org?  Okay so far so good. Grandpa's operating the internet. Okay. Let's see.  Now can we hear it?  Studies and observation extraordinary Survival game internal cancer patients with vitamin c a simple relevant non-toxic there a world-renowned scientist Linus Pauling, but rather than treatment effective currently successful 70s experiments also gave vitamin C intravenously. We didn't realize until the 90s that the same dose given IV can lead to higher levels in the bloodstream than a high dose vitamin c does help in terminal cancer.  Encouraging case reports continue to be published here. There was a regression remission Acure documented individual case of advanced kidney cancer bladder cancer 3 success stories out of how many I mean if it was three out of a hundred or even if the treatment is sufficiently non-toxic but there's evidence that IV vitamin C is widely used in the alternative medicine world as in 86% practitioner serving partitions Lone Tree in about ten thousand patients a year after manufacturers and they're selling hundreds of thousands of vials of the stuff in the US.  No matter how amazing these cases seemed it possible that cancer is just spontaneous. It was just a coincidence for sure. You have to put it to the test.  Today, there's been some small pilot study results so far have been disappointed. The good news is that in the study to demonstrate anti-cancer activity similar to what we do know is that the present stage of cancer treatment is unsatisfactory people have this perception of chemotherapy with significant enhancer chances for a cure, but put all our cancer-killing chemo together and the overall contribution to 5-year survival is on the order of 2% lower side effects for 2.1% at a cost of $100,000 per patient per year.  So may be worth looking deeper into therapies, like IV vitamin C. However the lack of financial rewards and against alternative medicine could dissuade conventional investigators and funding agencies from seriously considering this approach so decades later. What can we conclude after trial at least 1,600 patients over 33 years. We have to conclude that we still don't know whether vitamin C is any clinically significant activity?  Although there is currently no definitive evidence of benefit. The Mayo Clinic randomized control trials did not negate the potential benefit based on the routes of administration some kind of back to square one. Does it work or not? There are incomplete day that what we need are carefully controlled clinical trial question is what do we do until then who is completely non-toxic but it's only relatively non-toxic.  Virgin River series cases of kidney injury reported after all if it's so safe. Why did our bodies evolved to so tightly control against excess absorb?  They can also be expensive and time-consuming each infusion cost. I wanted $200 out-of-pocket since insurance doesn't pay for which can be quite a bruin for alternative medicine practitioners about 90% of the Millions for profit Arrangement. So there's Financial pressures and pushing both directions for and against on this treatment given the relative safety and expense. Okay find the vitamin C question can be put to rest once and for all button cancer treatment. We don't have the luxury of jettisoning possibly effective relatively non-toxic treatments. We should revisit promising Avenues without prejudice and with open mouth.  Okay, here's the here's the scary part. Did it work? Okay, so we're back to this. Okay. So the thing I want to make a point when I make is I know that was a lot of information so that's good cuz it's short and wide information and I suggest that this is a great place to start now, you know, he's one of the things about the Michael Greger Cannon and I don't mind as long as he makes the point he makes of a really interesting points. If you notice the phrase tainted by alternative medicine in that if you have too much pop cultural mumbo-jumbo, especially that doesn't pan out. There is an understandable resistance of academics and Professional Medical people to embrace something like that cuz people might perceive them colleagues as well as patients as well as funding organization is being not critical and not analytical. So that's one part of it and other part of it is that you know, he makes the point that you can tell just from the from the Commerce.  How much Vitamin C is been sold the number of Neil of pharmaceutical vials of vitamin C cause they do packaged that there's been thousands hundreds of thousands of dosas purchase somewhere out there and presumably get it to intervene as vitamin C and given to people probably in alternative medicine and yet you don't have this Groundswell of people saying I've been cured my cancer which you would hear about on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. You haven't see it. So there's some really interesting complex issues the frustrating thing for students cuz you like to have answers that you take as knowledge and I get that is there really isn't a solid answer but I want you to appreciate that about 55 or 60 papers went into him putting that video together. It is an absolutely astonishing thing that this individual does even those opinions are that you know, and and their Fair opinions that because vitamin C is cheap and not really patentable and not druggable there might also be resistance on that angle true enough. It's worth thinking of  These things on all of the angles. So I like that it's new on that is complex and that addresses these issues through through science through trying to look at the studies that I've actually did not and that is his deal. Thank you. Michael Greger. Okay. So this is us some other stuff and at what is are they good or bad? You know this this whole video we just watched really leads to this interesting question of how do we appraise things like this in off in the frustrating but intriguing thing in studies like nutrition is there's good and bad there's pros and cons and one of the phrase is it's moving around, you know, the sort of that what we would call the pods fear call Advia, you know, the wellness world is this idea of an experiment of 1 that each person is an experiment of one and this is this you can say that the detector goes out of that has ended  Do eyes Madison, you know, every genome is a little bit different everyone's experience their epigenetic print. There. Are there at nutrition is different the other side you can say, it's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, but the interesting question is how different are different people in terms of treatment modalities and it's an open question. So often you get pros and cons. It really would be Pro for some people and con for their people and our jobs are trying to figure that out. So emo tea vitamins. There's a study, you know, there were studies. This is a study with 27 Trials of 400,000 people. So one of these meta-analysis said that there's no clear evidence of beneficial effect of supplement on all cars weren't addresses vitamin supplements, like taking multivitamins on all the cars my tality cardiovascular disease or cancer another study from the Physicians health study. We talked to one of these huge respect their studies and watched a steady job a large number 5947 men over the course of 12 years. He's our health professionals that could be in a easily monitored and participant there.  No difference between the multivitamin to Placido groups in overall cognitive performance or verbal memory. So, you know, that would be something you think might be kind of a negative and your people take these studies going to stop wasting your money making expensive urine by taking large DIY taking multivitamins when it's you know food sources are the way it go. Okay. So this is one thought food sources are definitely preferred. They're safer and more complete. Now one of the things we've already talked about and if you've done your quiz scussion yet you will tomorrow we talked a bit about we try to create some ideas about the difference between supplementing one item like beta carotene and a carotenoid which diet and what are the differences what's going on? And that's actually a pretty complex quiz scussion as your as your eyes and he will tell you is really two things that happen in that process is the current average diet cost-benefit the beta carotene alone cause of death benefits. So we need to we need a hypothesis that says, why does the rich diet help and wine is Barrett beta carotene help.  Is the connection between a real thought experiment and you know, your creativity is as useful as yet why those two things exist like that. So but in general are food sources are preferred are safer and more complete and see your son really need examples of the beta carotene vs. Vegetables in the lung cancer started that you now know about the karat vs. Carat to be set upon me about it. And then there's actually some others in single apple and I saw a couple people eating apples during the movies is cool to bring food to movies. I like to do it two apples a good choice is a single Apple's equivalent antioxidant activity of 3.5 G of vitamin C. Are you might go does that mean vitamin C antioxidant sit all not only work together but evolve together as a human edible plant is a mammal edible plants. So very interesting that you know, Just Energy between phytochemicals remember a cup of coffee?  She has a thousand molecules in it thousand different molecules a plant has five or six thousand phytochemicals in it that are mostly completely unknown intriguing so supplements. And in some cases supplements can be harmful in excess vitamin A causes liver toxicity folate increases the risk of colon cancer, you know when you have its own oxygen also, so the take-home message from these kind of car that is if there's no deficiency taking more might even be harmful, you know, so that's one aspect of pro aspects to so, you know, although a well-balanced diet and this is from the annals of internal medicine. This is a legitimate Bonafide Journal of army people weigh and who have a lot of knowledge about these things and their peer review to other people read them and they say this article said that although a well-balanced diet is usually the best way to get essential nutrients few persons in the US follow the dietary guidelines consequently most persons in the US are not well nourished and this is interesting because  From when I was a child like the 1950s was everybody in the u.s. Is well nurit. I mean this is already in Accra because there are pockets of grave starvation and poverty Even in our wonderful country. Okay, so that's but even if you take the average person eating well upper-middle-class middle-class person because of the food supply in the nutrient deficiency of these calorie-rich foods that we will talk about. There are many people who have dietary deficiencies that go undetected. They don't have like scurvy and they don't have beriberi but there's a big gray or a between scurvy and very berry and Optimal Health and that's the interesting, you know spot to study. Okay. So most adults in the u.s. Do not get the era eyes are vitamins a d and magnesium potassium and calcium from their diet conversely person is taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement formulated and approximate the daily value will fill many of these nutritional gaps effectively Sapient low-cost. So the other side of the coin is  Who is dietary deficiency specially in subtler ways are not giving them the diseases you learn about in med school or here but you know any sort of subtle ways that might have, you know decrease productivity feelings of well-being, you know quality of life interesting. So that's sort of the pro and so, you know hears them here actually some studies that are you know, more details multi-vitamin mineral uses of SE with reduce risk of cardiovascular disease mortality among women in the United States. That was a 2015 study the large city multivitamins in the prevention of cancer in men. This is Jody positions house that he did John no advantage to cognitive defects found in similarly that multivitamins might help in the prevention of cancer. So it's a mixed bag and sometimes one thing we'll do something and not something else, you know, so in general, these are actually pretty interesting. This is from the CDC and other email government organization the Center for Disease Control.  Lots of really good epidemiologist know the sign his work there and so here are some things that are over consumed in under consumed. So sodium and saturated fat and I would say sugar also, although they didn't put here is overconsumed in our culture traumatically are consumed and some of the under consumed things are vitamin D potassium calcium iron and fiber. Okay. So these are although I sell some Fiber really going under the movie.  You know, it sucks and I will say this is a little person with hyperlink. I have actually drastically changed my diet since teaching this class and I'm afraid we might even go plant-based. I'm not quite ready to go the vegan route, but it says it is you can't teach this class and not come home or they would like this but I bring this little snack box now would like carrots and broccoli and all this carotid and then I forget I have it and go eat something crappy like everyday is like it's like you buy those reusable bags to go to the supermarket, but you always leave them in your car and then you buy another one and you forget a new bike has her a buck. And do you have a car full of reusable bags at 6 like you're going to live there. So if this is the same kind of thing, but okay. So now we're going to switch to talk to you about minerals. Okay, so these are minerals.  Yep, mean that other here's a fun biological hyperlink. I didn't realize is that 70% of the minerals on Earth these cool gemstones and minerals are due to biology their due to the interplay between the Earth's animals and organisms and the geological sphere Sol a huge number of the organisms. I mean of the minerals on Earth are due to biological processes, which I didn't know that I read that like a year ago, very cool. Very interesting. There's a deep deep interaction between the Earth and the organisms. So here's what we're going to talk about calcium phosphorus magnesium, electrolyte iron. Zinc and I-10 is going to go from this lecture into the next lecture to so we're going to talk about these and and one of the main ones are going to talk about his sodium cuz sodium is a major major dietary problem and a major health problem that every one of us is participating in accidentally.  We're going to think about that a little bit here.  Why do smokers need more vitamin C. The thinking is if there's a lot more oxidative incursion on the tissues all the time generation of carcinogens oxidative damage to the lungs and vitamin C is definitely helpful in that kind of awareness so that you you're chewing up more vitamin C and having more of it on board might be helpful. That's the thinking and I think this is strictly from epidemiological studies. So this is just a body composition chart with many many pretty colors. So this is actually just the amount of these minerals grams in the human body of these different minerals or not, you know grams is census 400 and something grams in a pound, you know, these are not huge numbers, but they are calcium very abundant phosphorus sodium sulfur. I mean, jassiem sulfur sodium chloride and it is very minor minor think some of them quite important anybody watching Chernobyl on HBO is crazy crazy crazy miniseries.  About the Chernobyl and cries and turns out iodine is super important in that anyways, I don't want to spoil no spoilers and reactor blows up damn it ruin all in day. So, okay. So going this way it turns out that one of the interesting features of mineral nutrition is that there are actually plant items that help there are there are dietary a process. He's in dietary practices that help mineral absorption and their dietary practices and dietary items that hurt. So there's actually it is one of the very rare cases were things in Plants might do something bad, you know, I mean, there are things in plants that are problematic like morphine and cocaine but there's so many plant items are. All right, you're awesome. But there are turns out they were both Auntie intro nutrients in plants that either enhance or hurt uptake of minerals. This is a fan.  Complex chart from a review article meeting people of thought a lot about this but here's just a little mini list cuz I just want to know a few of them. So they're factors that increase bioavailability and that's a great word. I don't know if you learn that word yet, but it's a great word bioavailability.  How many of you have heard that word?  Bunch of you. So by the degree to which something is taken up in the body and end up in the bloodstream. This is available to the organism when it's consumed or taken. Usually it's oral cuz that's the hard part bioavailability intravenous is pretty obvious. It's just the amount you load / the volume of the blood. So that's usually pretty intense by a man. But this is what is bioavailability is a major important important feature of both Pharmaceuticals in food items. So 1 in an interesting ideas. The glycemic index is really telling you the bioavailability of glucose as it's come from different sources. But so if you're taking a mineral Source how much of it actually ends up in the bloodstream is related to the bioavailability is batted around all the time. And so  So these are these are some of the some of the things that are the decrease bioavailability reduce gastric acidity. So if you're taking something that reduces gastric acidity would have some kind of problem phytic acid from whole grains oxalic acid relieve your vegetables and someone here mentioned oxalic acid + calcium confirm kidney stones. It's absolutely true. But also oxalic acid combine calcium for the same reason and not allowed to enter the gut so it's it's a double thing polyphenols in tea coffee and red wine. That doesn't mean you shouldn't drink coffee to the red line is just means it, you know certain cases where people are trying to load this and they have these things are problematic Hydro supplements a single minerals, you know can actually bollocks up the absorption of other mineral. So these are the kinds of things are thinking about so here is some of the some of the the different anti-nutrients. Oh bite it gas it is when it's actually is poly all the snaptrap Ali-A.  Inositol it to Six membered Ring that looks like a sugar not but it looks like one found in high quantities in whole grain Beez nuts other places. I'm yeast breakdown phytic acid. So living bread actually makes it okay, but in cultures that eat unleavened bread the you can actually have a substantial amount of phytic acid that had two blocks uptake of certain minerals oxalic acid, which has high concentration spinach actually make spinach not a very good a bioavailability source of calcium for that reason. Tanen's, you know, they can be an anti nutrient is in the ions that are especially susceptible to that uses calcium iron and zinc and not surprising. Those are all ions that form good chelation complex as if you learned that in chemistry, they have multiple charges it large the orbitals and they can be calculated easily. Okay. So we'll talk about calcium calcium is super important.  Average from all your dietary sources You observe about 25% of the total. So just looking at how much calcium is present in something you're eating his knee not be enough to know. So you have to think about that one has to think about is, you know, several functions of calcium in this are the two main forces one is calcium has an eye on doing all that wonderful excitability heartbeat muscle contraction neurotransmission the stuff you've learned about in your cool new Royal and Physiology classes, you know, it's basically the net result of a tissue that wants to do exocytosis, whether it be a neuron or a muscle or in our contraction like a muscle or a beta cell, you know that wants to release insulin or any of the neuroendocrine cells that wanted fuse vesicles with the plasma membrane. It's all about elevating calcium. And so it is very important neurotransmission muscle contraction. I should have hormone release here also a necessary one of the many pictures of Cu calcium entering a synapse and then causing these cool process is to  When were you get release of things through membrane Fusion try but the other function of calcium, it's you know, it is super important is as a domain ion for depositing bone-in for making bone, you know, hooray for our skeletons. It allows us to do so much great stuff, you know being a jellyfish is beautiful but doesn't have a lot of potential for powerlifting. Okay. So I'm so sneaky of the function of structure of the major component of bone and teeth as this are molecule hydroxyapatite.  funny name hydroxyapatite  and this is a calcium phosphate polymer or mineral is used to build bone. Okay, and the thing about Bo is although you look at about her feel it. It feels really hard and you know, it takes even a lot of effort to break it and they last deep into time when in an organism dies, the bones are around and then they can you know, the mineralized is bone is incredibly Dynamic. It's a living thing and the addition of calcium to bones are showing the first 25 years old like 25 years. Your bonus is constantly being built up in added to and and then after that it's a dynamic thing where you have a breakdown and synthesis, so you got net Edition up to about 20-25 years and then you start getting was called turn off her and one of the things about the body in general is pretty much every molecule in your body is turning over once a year, you know, you pretty much replace your entire contents once a year. We should pretty amazing to think about cuz we don't look any different from you in a little bit.  You're totally new person, but they are completely replaced Dynamics are in a really interesting part of biology. So turns out there's two basic cells that do this is the osteoblasts that build bone in the osteoclasts that that break down bone. Okay. So those are the two I'll see you again. This is review from physiology and you probably had this in a lot more details and I'm talking about it in your physiology classes, you know, and I remember you said that blast build and class collapse, but you know, it would ever since those are they worth are stimulated and it's the balance of that they create your constant bone structure and density. Okay. So it turns out there's a very fancy hormonal regulation of calcium and this the chameleon Graphics. This is one that would be useful for YouTube.  Salmon later when you look at it, and so it's basically showing here is the sort of net changes in blood calcium levels and when calcium tie one set of things happen that involve hormone calcitonin and when calcium is low another set of things happened in the Volvo hormone called parathyroid hormone. So but there's a number of different ways to this is the sort of Nigel Crawford way just a list of things would just be so then I found some nice Graphics to talk about this. So calcium is too low you got an increase in parathyroid hormone which increases calcitriol which is the active vitamin D. Remember vitamin D12 25 vitamin D3 is also called calcitriol and so is parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of this in the kidney and Kelsey mobilization from the bones, you know making so the bone is also a reservoir of calcium and when you need more in the blood cuz it's super critical to have correct levels of it for all that excitability stuff. It's a reservoir.  You get retention in the kidneys or doesn't get gotten rid of and you increase calcium uptake from the intestine. So it's really a complete motivation thesaurus release. Is it the kidney stop getting rid of it starts taking it out. It's a highly coordinated process orchestrated by parathyroid hormone in vitamin D and calcium is too low. You got another hormone called calcitonin produced and calcitonin decreases parathyroid hormone levels in causes, you know, calcium release decreases calcium released from the body is basically decreases all those things that were big increase in the other case was just push and pull going on. So this is actually another picture of this. So this is it shows the sword of body maps and these things are parathyroid gland releases it that's it near the thyroid next to the thyroid and parathyroid hormone acts on osteoclasts. It also acts in the kidney do to make active vitamin D in to conserve calcium and vitamin D.  New one to 25 vitamin D3 X on the small intestine to increase absorption. So it's a combined thing of the hormone and a vitamin D activated vitamin D tickets May and the other case with high blood calcium you get this other hormone calcitonin that's also released from that parathyroid here and it is released from the thyroid gland actually in calcitonin axon osteoclast cells. Low one axon the blasts to get you know, doing to improve calcium release and the other one axon the osteoclast to take up calcium to remove it from the blood lower the levels of this is Austin going on a synthesis removal and uptake that's going on all the time. OK it's over calcium the RDA in the recommended daily allowance and per day and the incision dressing the UL based on kidney stones like was mentioned in one of these texts question is around 2.5 grams today something for day. Some people are a different risk for 4.  Are kidney stones and other than once people have them they seem to be easier to get so this is very I think it's a little disturbing about this is that if you go to buy supplements, you can buy these calcium and Vitamin D supplements, you know, the in fact that you have delicious chewy gummies, you can get at Costco in Minot you can end up taking a crap load of calcium from those things that I know you're plus are amazingly delicious that you find yourself needing a plus. There's this new thing where people are saying that very high vitamin D3 levels are good at preventing infection and that might be pop science. I think there's some studies an implied is so you got this sweet spot of how much vitamin D3 should you take? How much are you prefer being calcium to the Des benefit? How much are you advancing not getting an infection or an illness? So interesting. So these are some calcium-rich foods of see there's a question of my mom always told me not to eat spinach and tofu together and I don't think she knew why so it was really interested. She is supported by Sia.  Mom knows does drinking milk actually help you grow when you are a little I never drink my milk be well-nourished allows people to grow to their full genetic and nutritional potential. Why does high blood calcium and low blood calcium both increase calcium uptake in the note that you noticed. I had decrease these things. So when increases the other decreases on that table here, that's maybe not so clear. So here I have increased calcium uptake decrease calcium uptake so good. I to text that but thank you for pointing that out. Okay. So these are the things calcium-rich food kale milk. This is one of the things about, you know, the rise of the Agricultural and Dad Dairy world, you know all are lactose intolerant.  Utahns that we are is it as milk is such an amazingly good source of nutrients. Okay. So and for the same reason you want to give calcium to little children so they grow is KO is a pretty good source of calcium a cop a cup of chopped kale is 94 mg a milk is 305 and also a sew-in you can absorb a fair amount of it. But you know a cup of kale is about 9/4 a cup of milk is 30% of the daily calcium. You need Sophia milks are really good source of calcium, you know, it's a good source of a lot of things but every one of the very best plant sources of calcium is collard greens, which is very southern food. I can go down south you off and go if you go to a a good soul food restaurant in south or in the Oklahoma collard greens will be right there along with the Fried Chicken in the Corn and cornbread and all that great stuff to eat your collard greens if you go to a cell phone  Are much better at being absorbed it has more kit has more calcium in it similar to absorb. So a cup of collard greens with can be very delicious. And you know, it's almost 30% like a cup of milk. So if it's food choices is important. And so one of the things that's in that that I noted before isn't the bioavailability of calcium can really be different so for milk products, but you said the estimated start time this is the percent of something so milk about 30% of scorpion from a source bok choy, really good but not super high, you know, so you can absorb amount of bok choy, is it submits very available, but you don't get as much as milk, so to trade up and spinach like that individuals. Mom said is even though it's pretty high in calcium in very poorly absorbed because spinach is rich in oxalate, you know, so that I can just hold on the couch as you're not going anywhere. Popeye. Okay. So there's this variability  Fortunately, these things are known. We have some text questions.  That was a question. What are the benefits of vitamin D and immune system? I don't think it's very well known anything about vitamin D is this is mega dosing vitamin D people taking thousands of units a day beyond are near the UL and you know, the I think it's partially anecdotal and some studies but no one really knows why this thing to remember about vitamin D is that it is a transcription activator. It is a molecule that binds to a receptor vitamin D receptor and stimulates the production of many genes, you know, it is a is a broad transcriptional activator and just lots of things so, you know, it's it it's not surprising as many actions and then when you take a lot of it knows maybe what are on pathway meaning what a vitamin D normal is or off pathway things that don't normally doesn't do it at higher doses. It might I don't think that's well understood go to look into it more. Good question. No, okay. Are there any real life questions?  Yes.  Wife when is low when calcium is low the intestine increases uptake from the diet and when it's high you get decrease so, you know, the parathyroid hormone tends to through vitamin D increase in touch tone and decreases it so it didn't make sense to get you get to where you yell Levy ating the the signal when it's high. You want to lower it by decreasing obstruction increasing excretion decreasing bone mobilization. I want to throw you one increase bone mobilization increase uptake and decrease excretion. So they also a piece  are there  okay. So these are some calcium sources of this instead of reiterating is dairy. Leafy greens collard greens is the best spinach high in calcium and poorly absorbed because of oxalic acid supplements. Now chocolate is another place where the supplements are very interesting so supplements because it was easy to take him and like I say, they're delicious gummies both with calcium and vitamin D3 supplements are calcium carbonates one. That's the cheapest calcium citrate if you have problems with low acid in the GI and their natural sources of calcium, like Forester shells and Bone calcium, but they can be problematic of those are highly concentrated source is so anything that the animals have picked out the oysters or the bones could be problematic. So, you know, that's it. That's a choice and I like I said and we have to really talk about this way to supplement industry is incredibly poorly regulated and it's poorly regulated strictly for for financial reasons. They know there are certain states have passed laws.  Supplement production that are you know strictly for commercial benefit and if there's an amazing number of stories of supplements that have been released that had then been demonstrated to be very bad and removed from the market the most egregious. When is it a modern mild stimulant called ephedrine that you can get ephedrine teeth and adapters really problematic. There's a there's another another supplement called Hydroxycut. You probably heard of it supposed to make you like slim and be a fat burner that has caused many many medical problems that are well-documented. So this is a number of these different supplements and it all starts with them being poorly regulated. Okay, we'll talk more about that. So here's the thing. This is actually a study done by the British medical journal in 2008 clearly showing that calcium increase the risk of a myocardial infarction tomorrow to call infection is a type of heart attack in event of v-fib infarction that can be litter.  We like frightening and that you have a calcium group receive. This is a woman's study with several thousand women 1400 women. I mean, so this is a a plot showing this is over a long. Of time that there's an increased risk of infection does it mean if you take calcium have a heart attack? It means this is a risk ratio. So it's a percentage risk. So that's one way to look at it is also done by Alice is so this is been looked at quite a bit. And so this is the myocardial infarction in this is actually the numbers ready. People are at risk going to risk. So you are the important point is he's not cute and numbers. This is one of the perplexing things about these kind of study. Do you have the calcium peoples of 12,500 12300, you know is your 11800 vs 7700k you actually have to use the tistics to figure out from these meta-analyses. Is this real? You know, when and how did it affect your life if you're gaining and calcium supplement?  You don't get enough of your diet. You know that might be worth be mild risk of a heart attack and you can do other things. So it's it's it's it's one of the tricky thing, you know, and so this is actually the meta-analysis kind of thing where they have this line is favors Placebo in this favors calcium in now, there's a lot of broads statistical is wobbling. You can see the error bars on these different things looks like there's a mild but easily damaged not easily you need thousands of people but they clearly demonstrable statistically significant risk. I'm taking calcium supplements. So here's the mother calcium supplements reduce bone turnover and slow the rate of bone loss. However, they have a weak effect on fracture rate. So there's a a small effect on bone Dynamics Arbonne physics so it but on the other hand trial and Noble and see if the calcium supplements increase the risk of cardiovascular disease Med analysis of calcium supplements 30% increase risk of Mario cardial infarction 12 to 20% increase  Stroke so you got to realize a 30% risk does not mean 30% of people are going to get it means that whatever the risk is its 1.3 times more than that. So it's not a huge change. It snowed by these numbers and feels like there's a risk. It is easier than its own third of the people that take calcium or going to like a heart attack at 30% increase in it can be it can be confusing sometimes Soco administration of vitamin D and calcium does not lessen these adverse effects cuz sometimes calcium can help you know, is it is a balancing Factor. So here's the interesting thing is the high total high calcium in a meal is about 500 mg for male, you know, so inhibit. Can  Inhibits zinc and iron uptake if you have too much of it cause blood calcium to spike and it rain Kris the risk of blood clotting so high calcium supplements along with a meal can be problematic. So the idea to keep total calcium to a less than a half a gram per meal avoid calcium supplements and most efficient. This would be some sort of home-baked advice for people. Okay. Now let's talk about the opposite side of this very important syndrome with osteoporosis and probably many of your part of osteoporosis in if you have aging relatives, you might be experiencing it directly and different age groups get it but osteoporosis defined by the World Health Organization is a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below Peak bone mass to 20 year old sex match healthy person averages what they do and I'd this is not this is from Nigel. He has all these things on the sides of what you're supposed to know and we just escaped from that. I want to get rid of happy for anyone goes  I will tell you what you need to know on the study list as I've always promised. So when I get rid of that, okay, so a peak bone mass reach of yours, then net loss of bone mass. You get what happens is when you get to be 20 25, you get different rates of bone mass loss. Everybody experiences rate can vary with people with genetics with diet out with other factors. Okay. And so this is the sort of conundrum something like twelve million adults in the US have osteoporosis is 300 million people 350 million people in the can maybe 400 now I have encountered lately, but you know, it's substantial chunk of people especially the elderly population Iran D actually an osteopath and that means I'm not osteoporotic but I'm getting close and then 43 million have low bone density. That's me. So, you know, it's pretty pretty  Price of these two 1/3 1/2 of women having at least one fraction their lifetime. So this is definitely something that affect women more because of a number of different wrecks the toilet xx's more and and and this is Jim so there's been a lot of study of women osteoporosis, but both both biological genders get it. Okay. And so this is sort of what it looks like his normal bone density looks like football Matrix, you know far less than two great big interstices like this and it actually affect posture in a variety of ways and one thing it's very distressing is it's an early indicator of osteoporosis is postmenopausal shrinking not going to tell you something everybody who gets to be my age start shrinking. I used to be almost five 8 now. I'm 5 6 and I found this out by challenging a friend of mine about who is taller and then we did that back-to-back thing in it.  Shrinking I noticed my dad who I miss he's long gone, but she got much smaller to the point where I could like take him know I'm getting it was incredible everybody. But the people with low bone density start shrinking pretty traumatic like an inch and a half to in and you will see this with people, you know who her or aging? Okay. So this is sort of the graph of osteoporosis and this is all about bone density and all about osteoclast osteoblast activity. So this is a healthy bone mineral density here. This is important come back in here. Okay. So so here is Asti. I shouldn't do that. You people have stuff to do they got to go places. I've stopped. Sorry. Okay, so call me bone mineral density, you know in this is the scale isn't you and this is just a qualitative.  Mineral density is here and misses and I'm not sure what these three curves are. I think this is is is ipso population of people who have over osteoporosis and then there's a subgroup Easter. This is a subgroup of people who remain okay, and it's the people who end up having us because osteopenia eventually becomes it very late life like 70. So here's where I am. I'm here.  Getting close. I want to be a peer. So I would have to start doing is is resistance training and jump roping know that which I hate so but I have to do that, you know how to start a live on it. Okay. So so osteoporosis risk factors are long-term deficiency and calcium and vitamin D intake and these things can you work over long periods of time if you have no for deposition as you'll notice there's her it's worth going back to this you'll notice this is structural difference. Like this is a very drastic difference in bone structure from here to repairing that by just suddenly get any osteoclasts to us to stop what they're doing in the osteoblasts to do what they're doing is not going to immediately Kiryu. It is a gradual process. Do you know what is a pharmaceutical challenge to cuz there's so many people with it. So estrogen loss. This is one of the reasons it that it's it's it's Pocus on the women who have high after dinner.  Activity weight-bearing resistance training and I do not know personally why weight training in and load activity increases off the bone density and I want to learn why I'm interested in that. I don't know I realized I didn't know when I was right. I don't know why that is for God sake over 30 years. Okay high sodium caffeine alcohol intake smoking Cola either kind of car. They claimed it affects only women. Not men. I don't know if I believe that acid reflux medication and genetics. So the worst there's actually, you know, start of a Geo genetic difference. So Asian and Caucasian or worse than Hispanics worsen Latina worse than African African Americans who the best just in terms of the Year call JB genetic Origins it now we're getting a lot of you know a lot of  A lot of spread throughout populations as they travel more nor less isolated. So the prevention is weight bearing exercise adequate calcium in the diet fruits and vegetables and good choice of genetics. So this is there's actually this is one thing that the pharmaceutical industry is very interested in although again in his problem. There's very good nutritional approach. This is a good idea, but the pharmaceutical industry has a reasonable steak in this game because so many people end up with osteoporosis that can be really problematic and really affect quality of life. And once you are osteoporotic, you know, it's hard to Suman exercise rich life and that kind of thing. It's challenging. So there's a number of different drugs. Some of them have very dubious utility a new one called abloh part that I made a blue Powerade tide, which is a 34 amino acid analog of of what's called.  A parathyroid hormone-related protein. So this is you know, every hormone has a bunch of different versions and I like it. And so this is a pep polypeptide. It's based on a natural protein that stimulates one of the parathyroid hormone receptors and help. So this is given intravenously or given subcutaneously and it it apparently house but the important thing about this is it's only for people with severe osteoporosis for this isn't a drug that you can take to tweak your bone density up a little bit and it is an expensive. You know, what biological molecule that is only now being investigated so stay tuned on that but it do what it does tell you if there's a really strong vested interest in improving pharmacologically this syndrome. Okay, and then there's you know, that's a new drug for osteoporosis is it turns out that story of this is a large prospective study with 24,000 women's going to Shanghai women's health study. So you and you have a lot of soy eating in that culture.  I'm also you have Asians are the highest, you know, osteoporosis risk, like my new mother-in-law has broken both of her legs from fracture from osteoporosis, but she is such a tough person that she has begun running 5 K's after both but some people are just born but this is a good example that she's Taiwanese. That's why I brought her up. She's 100% So Prospect of studies 24,000 women over for 25 years and a cup of soy milk bottom line store in take reuses risk of fractures by 35% That's pretty good. That's pretty good in fracture is a you know, when you get to be in their sixties or seventies having a fracture is not like having a fraction when you're a child falling off the jungle gym. It is a very difficult medical syndrome to deal with off and you don't get for healing and practically affect Mobility quality of life and other health things that require motility. So it's it's a thing. Okay. So let's talk a little about phosphorus and magnesium.  Get to sodium today, but that's okay. So it's involved in bone growth and maintenance. So every every moment every atom of or ion of calcium requires a phosphate to make this hydroxyapatite and they're also phosphate is critical for nucleic acid synthesis in energy metabolism ATP and go to the tune of 70 kg a day of ATP you turn over if you were to add it all up. I'm starting a sufficient answer vitamin D blood levels regulated by the kidneys. Okay. So phosphorus has a RDA of 700 mg per day. How do u l s 3 or 5 3 to 4 grams per day in again? That's because kidney function is challenged by really high amounts of of a a phosphate. So the usual intake is a 1.1 to 1.6 Grand Touring notice that even a cup of yogurt has quite a lot. So this is one of those cases were the natural usual intake. This is just population averages is greater than the RDA. It's not a bit.  Manuel but it's interesting that just eating kind of food that we eat as a population. We're taking more more phosphate in that we need and phosphates are pretty abundant ion magnesium same kind of deal in this case magnesium is lower than the RDA. So there's plenty of foster the diet, but many many people have a mild magnesium deficiency something we don't we don't take a nap. So Rd is 400 Megs per day for men 300 Megs per day for women. The usual intake is about 350 to and so we're actually normal intake for the you-know-what healthy westernized mechanize diet is below what we need. So I actually do take a magnesium supplement each day. I've been told that this is something that older people especially endurance hobbyist and did not have enough up and if you remember from 102 every damn reaction had magnesium under it like  Watch always there. So any sort of energy into ATP phosphate type thing Pollyanna and uses of magnesium often as a cofactor, especially Bosco transfer. So there's no OU well for normal food 350 milligrams per day. And if you have if you take too much you can have these sort of things but the important thing is magnesium deficiency is you can call me Roland cardiac problem. So magnesium is incredibly important along with calcium and excitable tissue and energy metabolism. Okay, so we're going to talk about electrolytes a little in this will be a good segue. So electrolytes collection of ions that are constantly involved in physiology in the major events of sodium potassium hydrogen ion chloride bicarbonate inorganic ions in the interesting thing about these that you've learned in physiology as they have extremely different distributions inside a cell and outside of cells and as you know from learning  Neurotransmission that beautiful imbalance of tons of potassium inside hardly any outside and tons of sodium outside and hardly any inside. He's the reason you have all this fantastic excited. This is a reason we can say the reason that our heartbeats Sushi million times without stopping the reason that we can move at will with our muscles. It's all about those gradients being capitalized on to do near Transmission in tissue excitation sodium. These are that the basic numbers, you know, you probably have learned these another time eph impacts on the pH of tissue and that's super important. Do you know the pH of your blood and your tissue is super well control and variations and Physiology and a lot of interesting ways by Carmen it like that. You know what I'm going to stop at 3:20 my watch History 19 and a half, but I'll let you I'll see you next week. "
