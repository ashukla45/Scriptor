I was calling her Melissa. Maybe she's mad at me, but it's Laura. That's why I have L here.  The iPad doesn't seem to be working anyways, so I may have to just do it straight by phone. It's been very feisty lately. It's not the behaving normally so I'm going to do it by phone so that we know text message and I don't even need you Laura go there but it will be it's a little bit of a mess because the numbers all come into by user as opposed to in order, but we'll figure it out. Okay, we were talking about open this up or shoot. We don't even have it since I came early and it's just a big mess.  You guys could have kept on hanging in rapping. Let's see what happens.  This is a good sign something's happening.  This is always think the professors and Dayton are the students dream, but the professor's nightmare. Okay. So here we go.  And I don't even have a picture of the iPad isn't working. So I'm going to try to do it myself. There's lohrey a text message to General. Yay.  Hey, can you turn up the mic? I just did.  I'll try again and you're just like me listen closely.  Cuz I noticed there's a lot of wrestling in Revelation. You're all excited because it's Tuesday.  It's almost the weekend. Alright, so  okay, so we were talking about some aspects of metabolism. I want to finish that up and then we're going to actually have two lectures worth of carbohydrates incredibly interesting topic or vital. Okay, but we're so before that. Remember we were talking about discussion section and we're trying a bold experiment in discussion section. I made you all raise your right hand and promised you would look at those jeonguk study and if you looked at it  I'm supposed least ten of you did now I feel like that that's a little cynical right cuz you raise your hand you will notice is pretty complex. Like it's a pretty simple punch on eggs might be bad but it's a pretty complex study and I would even say that it's complex to the point where a non epidemiologist might have a lot of trouble reading it and really extracted. So we're going to do something a little different one of these incredibly important things that will impact directly on you, especially if you're a health professional but even just as a person living in these information, which society is people do said he's like that and then there's all these other levels of reported there is review articles. There's Pier indication, there's lectures. There's also newspaper articles. There's internet post Twitter feeds and all of that is different levels of information about Windows podcast. Some of them are great.  Don't hit women study came out. I saw two people hitting when is studying came out there was a lot of noise about it because the eggs the problem with eggs comes and goes it's bad. They're good. They're bad. So I thought it'd be fun to look a little at that. So what you have to read actually read and this might be aware that has a lien to you. So I'll spell it but you have to read I know it's not a lien what you up to read? Is this Eklund Camp article on the Shang eggster. This is a much lighter fare. This is like eggs without the yolk. I know like when you hear that you have to read something. It's like a foot.  Can't we scared him? So I'm going to show it to you. I even I grabbed a version of it. Here it is. It's like one of these internet PDF big fat tax only a few pages. So it's very cool about it is actually it's it's a pretty neat article because this journalist is one of these Wellness journals does a web page website interview the number of cardiologist and food scientist to see what they thought about this Jean egg study and what day what what how to think about it? And so there's some really interesting to what organ discussion sex with your quiz scussion is going to be about is this article trying to find a little bit about the Zhong X that is so you guys are going to discuss what this article says. What makes sense why it might be a little bump the bass take what you got from it. So here's the thing. If you don't read it, you're putting the burden on your Discussion Group Bros and sis has  You got to bring it for your brothers and sisters in the discussion group. Okay, that's why you have to read it. You want to pull your weight and be part of a community also to make the discussion more interesting, but it's also cool because if you go through this nutrition class your friends will go or what to do when they're going to ask you all of that, you know, and and the more you learn the more people will ask you and so this is good way to start being able purses. I promise you people are all your nutrition. Should I be eating eggs? And you go wrong eggs study, you might think there's some risk, however, it's important to put it into contextual view. So this is why you're going to do this. I think you'll like it. I think it's actually pretty relevant print in Jersey and I realize that we have to actually write Zhong an email and asked Zhang  Because John was the first author named usually they're the most directly involved in the study some questions about how they collecting the data cuz they and I sat around and could not figure out some aspects of how the day was brushing with the primary paper. That's what we do for you. We want to help we said God I really don't know we went deep into the supplements that can so you can help us out in the middle of a bold experiment that seems to be failing mildly, but I'm going to invite me to put my phone on.  Safe with you guys so many of them put my phone on non auto lock.  display and brightness  do not lock actually can get Siri to do this this right? Hey Siri open auto lock.  Hey Siri, open auto lock.  Take a look at the auto lock setting you have to tell me I just open it whenever I have a South African guy as my Siri. It's just as  When's the rest of them but okay, so we're doing it, okay?  This is not the quicker. I don't get onto Russell Ranch clicker. No, this is just a reminder of a thing is  I want to make sure you know, the mammals can't make glucose from fatty acids. You can't do it. You can get a little bit of label in through the Krebs cycle. But anytime you make glucose you need a starting molecule a bigger three carbons are bigger and fatty acids give you a starting molecule of two carbon side of the seat. Alcoa's you just won't work and the difference between glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids are the glucogenic ones are metabolized is something that has more than two carbons like a like of Krebs cycle intermediate or pyruvate or something like that and the ketogenic ones are metabolized to acetylcholine, but I noticed that we have this you say I notice on that graph you showed over that picture you showed a few days ago that there's some amino acids that are ketogenic and glucogenic.  Malik pathway one of them gives you a molecule bigger than three carbons bigger than two carbons everything glucogenic one and the other path light gives you a c look away. So that's ketogenic okay with that and I'm hoping you'll learn that a 102 but if you didn't now is a perfectly good time to learn it. There's no bed time like the present. Okay, we'll talk more about this in this is basically this is one with I thought of like 20 ways to try to teach us and it's always difficult. I don't really know why but it is but this is one way to view that you can't take a seat of clay carbon in converted into glucose carbon has every single acetic away that enters the Krebs cycle to CO2 is released. So there's no net flow of carbon in a bigger molecules like glucose. Okay, so that's maybe a comfort mrs. Maybe one way to look at that.  Okay, you can just believe it. But if you want to convince yourself, you might have to look at the at the pathways then we will talk more about this when we talked about ketosis and starvation and the key ketonic diet all very interesting and they ketogenic diet. They're all related to this fact this fact, they're all related to so here's some big parrot of the metabolism of about metabolism in and you know, we're trying to think specifically about how metabolism related to nutrition and whole body stores are molecules in energy compared to critical to maintaining ATP production in this is where we stopped by somebody and it is absolutely critical mammals are in the business of maintaining blood glucose in 5 million mollar around 5 millimolar 70 80 mg per deciliter for some reason for deciliter as the measure for blood glucose and if you buy a blood moon,  Best beater I have one just for fun. It's kind of fun. You know, you can get them at the drugstore. They're kind of cheap nerdy fun measured in milligrams per deciliter, even though it's just a weird concentration. So that's what you'll see a normal blood glucose is between 70 and like 95 or 100 mg per deciliter that you are metabolism your organs. Your body will go to Great Lengths to keep glucose at those level is not a big problem acutely. It's a big problem chronically low is a big problem acutely acute means in the moment right away. If your blood glucose drops below 70, you will definitely feel it. If it drops below 50 milligrams per deciliter, you might go into a coma so it's really important that blood glucose is always kept the same.  So another imperative metabolism is sources of energy that vary with time. So we preferentially use carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are a great great energy source, and we will preferentially use them if they're available.  And then they will use fatty acids amino acids. So in the absorptive phase like right after we eat and that's called postprandial. Let's set up a terms Corral here.  I'm so we have Fran deal.  I'm Randy all that. This is prandial so brand new. It's actually you know what I should always use capital letters. That's the first my little erasers are gone. Holy crap.  I've had them here for Munch who took my erasers by some desperate assistant professor know I'm kidding.  That's crazy. What was anyone needs them for? Like, how should I be looking everywhere for one of these? Why would anyone need a small eraser except board had gathered a hell of a lot of water bottles down here?  I don't want to use a swear word, but that's kind of effed-up. I mean wow.  I mean I bought them to give I'm a giver. I'm like the liver I'm a giver and  Lamp uses big thing. That makes me look tiny. I look like an l.  Jesus or anyway prandial  maybe someone will listen to the podcast in Gilded Lily bring back a little Appalachian school teacher erasers. I don't know but after eating okay and so in the absorptive phase if you are as after glucose is a primary source of energy. It's in the blood were using it and then we are calm down and use fatty acids to I'm in also as you may have learned in 108, there's very definite different usages of fuel to pending on your activity level. When were when were sedentary or or or working at a very low level of activity. We tend to use fatty acids. And as our intensity bear activity goes up will use more glucose. That's a whole other thing during cycles of eating and not eating in a we're gifted because we have a gastrointestinal system that delivers food gradually in the body and we have storage mechanisms. We don't have to eat all the time. We're going to constantly for it.  We cannot do other things like filled cultures and teach classes. And so there's this arm going oscillation between insulin and glucagon and insulin is the hormone of Plenty. It's what's release to say. It's time to store food we have food is postprandial. Okay and glucagon is the hormone that gets released for this is crazy. So her mother gets released when store start dropping we need to start mobilizing thing. So it's really that we just could look upon as a hormone of impending catabolism and insulin is a hormone and intending Annapolis would be one way to view and so you got these oscillations after meals after a meal glucagon goes down. That's blue and Insulin red goes up, you know, cuz it's it's Single by the pancreas and it's actually interplay of two kinds of cells called the beta cells the beta cells of the pancreas and alpha cells of the pancreas in this. I think you covered in 102. We certainly covered it.  Now, you know the pancreas has his whole other life as a secretory, Oregon and produces bicarbonate a few other enzymes. It's incredibly important in that role and but the small islet cells of the pancreas are incredibly important for controlling metabolism. So it's kind of cool. The pancreas is getting the new helping mobilize and get the food into the body and then using it and releasing hormones that control how we employee or deploy those molecules. So the pancreas the islet cells involved beta cells and alpha cells in close proximity any insulin that gets released from the beta cells actually controls the glucagon released for the app. So so they're they're pushing and pulling all the way at the cellular level. Okay.  The red cells at Sea like I drew this those are blood vessels you mean this these things?  Are those are the somatostatin producing cells that probably we're not going to talk about their red South BET The Debaters to hear the beta cells and the alpha cells are light blue and these red ones are private somatostatin producing cells that we don't talk about as much in and I'm guessing though. So what happens is after a meal you get a spike of insulin that relates to the spike of glucose. You see the insulin is is tuned to the blood glucose levels in his blood glucose levels in Sims released and then as the blood glucose is is is brought down through the action of insulin. The insulin goes away too and to get these constant oscillations in the glucagon goes the other way and what an interesting calculation you can make is you can compute how high your blood glucose glucose would go if you didn't have insulin working and it would go very high. So the damping that insulin does is really  Depressive and it keeps things fairly low even after a big meal. Okay, then we will talk more about the aberrations of insulin regulation that are met with diabetes and the effects it has on metabolism as well as some of the dietary responses to diabetes and people are dietary dietary approaches to buy diabetes. Basically, I guess I think it's you know, I'm sending familiar is insulin tends to lower blood glucose by increasing storage glucagon tends to raise glucose by decreasing storage and increasing production mnemonic device. I came up with the my class. So you Randy Hampton survivors will remember this is glucagon is produced when glucose is gone. Get it when glucose is gone. You give glucagon get it. That doesn't that's poetic doesn't mean glucose actress to be gone. It just has to be going down, but that's okay. Whatever.  Is a little description is insulin causes an increase in glucose uptake in a number tissues. I'd like the glycogen synthesis which lowers blood glucose dose of insulin tends to increase blood glucose uptake of glucose storage in muscles and liver and so it tends to lower blood glucose. And that's why a diabetic will take a shot of insulin when their blood glucose is high because it stimulates those processes. This is not the first time you've heard this but it's okay. I don't know why I have both of those. They're okay. So another aspect of insulin affect a lipid storage don't hear as much about this because you know diabetes was discovered insulin was first really understood as a gluco regulatory hormones, but it actually insulin and glucagon both affect lipid mobile.  Station in lipid stores as well. Okay, and there's this very complex interplay between lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism and diseases like diabetes. So it's not surprising. Hey, we just ate we got to take advantage of all these useful molecules insulin increases fat storage and glucagon decrease as fat storage and increases mobilization. So think about is glucagon is sort of like a slow-acting version of epinephrine they act in a very similar way it sort of their both go time hormone decreases lipolysis and decreases the activity of hormone sensitive lipase. So hormone sensitive lipase. Is it useful term hsl  wishes for my own  Sensitive abbreviate. Lipase and this is the this is a Lover's have a lipase that hydrolyzes triglycerides to make Three fatty acids lower the activity that increases fatty acids storage. Okay, where is glucagon increases lipolysis and hormone sensitive lipase meeting increases the release of fatty acids from stores and increases their production and availability of them, which is something you'd want to do is glucoses away now, so that sort of three aspects that I talked about him and I talked about the incredibly important role of vitamins and nutrients in controlling tons of metabolic pathways and I showed you that vast list of precursors to co-factors and all the factors like riboflavin it and f a d and f m n and so they're so intimate connection between the vitamins retake and a huge number of enzymes. It will only work if those vitamins are available stuffed one connection and the other is you know, this energy metabolism we're talking about is, you know store  Bring an interconverting metabolites that we consume in a like glucose can become fat and fat can be stored as triglycerides and metabolism is really important at this very large collection of diseases that are either affect what we can eat or are abbreviated by nutrition aspects and end the sort of simplest version. These are called inborn errors of metabolism of inborn errors.  This is like a standard term its term of art not arrows errors in the sociology Department inborn errors of metabolism are examples of a single. Usually the ones that are best understood as a single enzyme that is deficient or not working correctly or absent that affects a particular metabolic pathway. So I want you to step back a second. Think about the metabolic pathways Charter. I showed you, you know, it's that daunting chart with all those circles and and Papas with arrows and support remember that every single one of those arrows.  Is an enzyme it's encoded by a gene every single one of those arrows is under genetic control by a gene product be needed for that Arrow to work meaning every single one of those arrows is subject to the rules of genetics including the simple. Mehndi Mehndi Indian religion is like wrinkled peas movie P tall planter plain and fancy Wheels in that kind of thing. So metabolism is subject to and nutrition accordingly are subject to all sorts of important features that are ruled by genetics. And so you might imagine if you had a metabolic pathway you were missing one of those arrows missing one of those enzymes to a mutation in a gene and encoded enzyme you might have an observable clinical syndrome and these as a group are called inborn errors of metabolism and amazingly enough, but this was a one-time suddenly Realize by a fellow named Archibald garrod. He was a Scottish position.  Who started realizing that many of the diseases he would see that it looks like they involved processing of nutrients in metabolic processes where describable by Mindy Lee inheritance. He was like the first person to really see that these things ran in families in ways, you could understand in the same way as been dealing genetics and the first is easy actually studied was one of a very mild symptoms called alkaptonuria. It involves a van intermediate in the metabolism of of aromatic amino acids are tense of build up in the urine. So it's very easy to see cuz the urine is really Darkly colored and has an odd scent and so it was actually very once he found people have had this it was not hard to study it to figure out what's going on. So this is he was the first person in true that sort of you might think that that was kind of a shock. Why would you care about that at the patients were okay, but it led to some really deep thinking about the nature of metabolism and how genes control it. So this is actually a number of diseases that Garrett  Discover this is. This is the one that he is best known for in this molecule how much anticipated acid builds up and is a very noticeable by-product in the urine. It just gets a urinated out and there's a number of different these are all and if you actually was big charts of inborn Errors of metabolism, there are thousands now diseases that have been noticed studied and in some cases alleviated by understanding them. We're going to talk now about a much more clinically important disease called phenylketonuria. And this is a beautiful example of a basic direct science leading to a really reasonable nutritional approach to a disease. So you probably all heard of phenylketonuria PKU PKU  Peek at you. It sounds like a university but it's not and what happened was in 1936. This guy I was born for letting you think he'd invented Haagen-Dazs with all those who know his name, but he was that he was Norwegian and his mother and father and a and b came to him and they had two children who were showing clear strong symptom ology. They were mentally very delayed. They were non-responsive and it was really tragic Vedra little children and he was able to discover that in their urine. There was a certain molecules present that it had certain qualities that didn't make sense and he discovered through it. It's actually incredible Straight Ahead organic chemistry who discovered that the urine had an entity that reacted iron and made this bright green color and he figured out it was a ketone and furthermore is a keychain with an aromatic residue in it. And he realize that what they had was a buildup of this molecule.  You will hear of phenylpyruvate now. I know you all know how to draw pyruvate cuz who doesn't know how to draw pyruvate. I mean everyone can relate to Cocoa to tell you remember it.  Chicago, that's it. That's your 102 if you had Aaron, and he didn't do to Cocoa with you to screw that but you can learn here to Cocoa. That's how you remember it and fennel pyruvate looks like that's it has a group on it. And this is a direct what this is what this is my good people. This is the this is the alpha keto acid version of phenylalanine. And so I don't know how you pronounce and knowing the metabolism he figured out that what was missing. What was Man created gone crazy. What was missing was this enzyme called? Phenylalanine? Hydroxylase? Phenylalanine? Hydroxylase is used in the normal course of using felling a line to make things and when it's missing the phenylalanine just builds up builds up and North  Metabolic pathway d d animated to this stuff which has toxic effects and also built up in the urine and that's how he's able to detect it. And so this is sort of the comparison. This is actually incredibly quaint picture that I got out of a very old paper, but sort of you have a certain blood level of phenylalanine. Okay, and in normal cases, the phenylalanine is floating around the blood is used to make things like tyrosine tyrosine is a precursor of a number of neurotransmitters. It's an important amino acids in protein. And if you have a block of this phenylalanine, hydroxylase got to be phenylalanine builds up to level C. I don't know if you can see this by the normal levels are 123 mg per deciliter and in a PKU patient there 2264 Dexter their 2250 Times Higher and this is his levels of this are not good to have no way to deal with it and it turns out that all you have  To do for a space with PKU wants you to text it is is restrict their phenylalanine. Make sure to provide them with the tyrosine. They can't make any longer and they're fine. So this is why you receive PKU warnings. I mean, this is so for example, you might think we'll where is phenylalanine comes from all kinds of things. Are you have to have protein limited or or protein control diets, but also this sweetener aspartame, which is the blue. Yeah. I know we all your sweetness do the pink ones the green ones if your hippie the yellow ones if you're a modernist and the blue ones if you like peptides in the blue wine is equal and equal is is has this and that's why equals as ingredients dextrose with maltodextrin aspartame and you'll see this is aspartame which has it been allowed such a rich source of phenylalanine and they actually warned people with PKU to avoid I taking my guess is you'd have to eat a lot of equal.  Not that many felony Landing in the diet. And so this is actually kind of a striking photograph in the early days before they knew this there were no cases where a family had a patient who grew up at 2 in NH pass when the symptoms could be reversed before they knew about the dietary modification. So this isn't very unfortunate. You can call it an accidental controlled experiment in which this brother who is Xi was not treated that way cuz it was such a new therapy and he is severely mentally disabled his two-and-a-half-year-old sister was treated by spies and they knew and she was perfectly fine actually grew up into a normal adulthood. So there's a critical window in which you all you have to do the dietary manipulation with the disease it is with all these long-term and even permitted symptoms simple modification of the diet literally makes the difference between cure and cause that's pretty cool. You're pretty important.  Now we're going to ship gears. Let me see their questions.  If you get your gallbladder removed what Nutritional Lifestyle that I have a friend who is missing a gallbladder, what's the friends? You know, it's your choice, but I'll be pretty careful about how much Liberty is there other ways to absorb lipids in the gallbladder helps and I think it varies with different people's dietary of Elections. Let's see food, food, officially postprandial somnolence. I like that.  During the postabsorptive phase. Is there a ship to create fatty acids well postabsorptive you and you're storing them. And then what you do is as glucose level start dropping you start using fatty acids more. There's a hormonal regulation of the mobilization of fatty acids.  Okay. Are you going to post the study list? I did you list posted it. Did it on Sunday? No.  I'm singing. No, hold on.  This is worth a little hyperlink. Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to do this together with you. I watch won't be able to get the internet. Come on.  This would never happen at Harvard. Okay, come on. Okay. There we go.  Did I?  one through four  Okay, hold on.  I want to prove it my Pruitt trying to add.  What's my name?  They just gave me a bunch of dots for a code. I don't know what that is. Okay, so, all right. All right. All right.  All right. All right. All right.  luxury slides  study lesson terms  Okay, let's study list.  Check it out. Open it.  how to make someone like you to lecture 3 lecture for so there  Okay, but I do the same thing. I asked first and look later. I'm not kind of guy hold on but I'm going to do something else just to scare the person who texted me.  okay, so, okay, so  all right.  Where are we doing for people with masks? Don't use that in lectures. It's like, you know, you're not a scientific question. So scientists are pretty serious people though doesn't go over. Okay, so we're all good. We're good. Okay, here's the number that person I'm kidding. Okay, so we're going to talk about them in a Broadway. But it one of the questions that will definitely arise constantly is are they bad or are they good and I think it is TV bad or is she totally depends on what you're watching and how much you watching what you're using it for. It is music bad or good music. Absolutely Central role in our diet and our metabolism.  You probably see I've heard of all of these books. In fact, I went by read this book with a group of freshman for a freshman seminar was quite at this is a very famous book that came out in 1972 And this book actually underwent incredible very focused depression by the sugar industry and end this this author was debunked. He almost lost his post at the University was at where is it? Turns out they practically everything you said is epidemiologically accurate and he was really sort of a a Visionary about the importance of restricting the amount of pure sugar that we eat. So there is a dark side to wear to but the question is where do we stand as tomorrow's parents? Tomorrow's Physicians tomorrow's people who wanted you to explore On Wellness. How do we do that? So we first have to get some times together. So we're going to talk about what these different sack rights are and again, I'm thinking this might be  Review, but there's in a collection of sugars that are called monosaccharides mono.  stack  car rides  and these are actually a collection of an MBA DanTDM live exactly the same empirical formula C6 h-12 o-6 and they only very by the stereochemistry of where they Oasis are on them. So I feel jealous ones and no you don't have to memorize the structures, you know, you don't even have to recognize instructors in this case, but I want you to notice two things. Number one. They are all very similar. They have exactly the same formula number to they're all either aldehydes are ketones in this open form a number 3, and I'm hoping that you learn this and when time it is cool if you haven't went out where it is a form ring forms called anomers and if you don't know what an atom or is that was a good time to learn it and a number you gave me new to this but didn't know what the term was as those circles that they form the circle sofa for glucose Sprint and see the circle metaphor.  Circle is because this O H attacks this aldehyde group in Nick's a ring called a hemiacetal and that opens and closes all the time. If the ring goes one way, it's an alpha form. If it goes the other way. It's the beta for him. That's how that works. Okay, and that's why you can see Lennie or forms of the sugars or circular for him. And normally in solution are constantly oscillating between one for me. The other is in equilibrium level like for the alpha and beta forms of glucose. I think it's like 6733 for one of the other ones slightly stable and the chemistry of them gets interesting when you start locking those forms into polymers are these are the three monosaccharides disaccharides and the ones that we often consumed in there. So there's and I want you to just know the definite what these are like, you know, the glucose that sucrose is glucose + fructose. Okay, and that and that maltose is glucose glucose.  Mystery but I again we're not going to dwell on that. That's why I make it to a study list and it turns was so we don't have to spend a lot of class. I'm talking about what you have to know. You can just find out by looking at that list before you text me. No, it's okay. I don't mind I want to make sure I had it three different disaccharides. This is maltose like a malted milk. This is a sucrose and this is galactose and glucose making black toaster. This is the milk sugar and my wife is extremely intolerant of lactose. So we're going to talk about lactose intolerance a little later. She act like she at makes her the wild-type and I'm the mutants because I'm lactose intolerant as many people from the Western European climbs are due to the rise of Agriculture. Anyway, we'll talk about that all later. But I want you know, what these are now sucrose is  Really interesting cuz this is what we eat in great amounts hundreds of times as much as people did a hundred years ago and it breaks on almost instantly into fructose are fructose and glucose and the the degree to which the sugars are bad for us and the extent to which that's due to amount vs. Composition is a really really interesting question. So, you know those okay with pictures like this cuz I want you to notice something you see this Bond here going to be fine. See that blond hair that I highlight a spotlight.  And this one here how weirdly. This one she's the heck of looks like a sine wave. This is lazy carbohydrate chemistry. So carbohydrate always do this and they'll drop a bomb like it if you have glucose. I'm just going to drive that the Rings, okay.  Bear with me here. So this should be  Queso, the maltose is Alpha One for glucose glucose glucose and the correct way to draw that is like this cuz it's basically a split water out and made an ether linkage all the carbohydrate chemistry lot like this. I'm going to erase this.  For some reason there's a convention in Charlotte like this. No self-respecting. Abbreviate saturated carbon with a Vertex right? So you might think it's around X. So, is that a carbon or what? It's not it's just crappy crappy nomenklatura. Okay. I shouldn't podcast that there might be glycobiology the age of pugilism.  I can fire a few big champions in this class to help me out come out.  Okay, so so I wouldn't want to make it clear until this is actually just next fight I grabbed is a much better to patient is this is the bonds are correct. This is what they really I mean are like in representation is a water has been split. Can you get basically what looks like an ether linkage? Okay. So this is the correct. So this is sucrose lactose and maltose and the reason I don't love these is cuz they made them upside down, you know, this this sugar is inverted so it so it has a nice shape for the bond drawing a beta linkage is difficult. So but you get it the only three dietary sugars and answers as plant products and stuff in there and if you probably even wrong to call them phytochemicals because they're still abundant, you know, there's all sorts of sugar. So this is a very popular one called raffinose and raffinose in its see  Felicity already tells us something interesting about the interplay between gut metabolism and human metabolism. So this actually is a little gallery of the different monosaccharide. So this is galactose alpha alpha one-six linked glucose, which is Alpha 1/4 lengths to fructose. Okay. Now this is sucrose we love that but when the girl actresses attached to it, there's a big problem is this stuff we can't metabolize that our cells do not know. How do not have what's called Alpha galactosidase? Okay. So that's an enzyme alpha-galactosidase or alpha-gal now if a glycoside ace clean leaves of that particular galactose Bond and so what happens in this is actually common in a lot of different intolerance things like lactose intolerance is related to this also is you ingest that it passes through the small intestine with all the enzymes and acidity and all that stuff doing its thing.  To no avail it ends up in the large intestine. What you now know is the site of a hotbed of echo logical microbial activity, you know, the colon is to where it's all happening in terms of Gino's number and those bacteria. I have a field day they go crazy and they start making lots of fermented products and gas and one of the intolerance features as you know, it has diarrhea and and and terrible stomach difficulty in lots of flatulence. So this is really a problem in the trouble with wrapping those as it's in lots of different. It's in beans. It's in cabbage. It's ingrained and so depending on the extent to which your microbes are any extent to which you eat it. It can be a problem. So amazingly there's another nutritional solution to this. This is a product of Dino has been around forever. I've heard of it when I was a kid and and Binoo is actually a pretty sophisticated and it's it's a package edible Ensign Sobe know is he is supplying the alpha-gal  Societies that we don't normally what's that?  Penny is Sabino people stopped advertising.  You're making fun of her product. Okay, so so be no is it you can go buy in the supermarket and its supplies that missing enzyme so it before it gets the large colon and and and gastrointestinal disaster you get cleavage of the galactose off which gets metabolized in the sucrose is also invertase and it would please us to grow stupid. It's really the alpha galactose raising dietary solution to a fairly intricate microbial problem in time.  so  I have that old time going backwards. That's why.  Polymers in this is where it really gets interesting it in terms of carbohydrates. So because these are I mean I didn't link these but if you look at the structure, you know, here's this is glucose. Actually. This is alpha glucose like that and them down down you want another another little demonic. If you're not you're not on 102 Randy Hampton Auto Tune survivors is you might think you need to have those anomer is so this is glucose.  Down down down like that that's glucose. And this is alpha glucose and if you can convince yourself of this when the animal opens up when you get an alibi here when the 608 attacks of a text from one way the Ohr goes down but attacks from the other way they always cuz I was out of hydro cleaner cleaner, right? Okay, so you might how do you remember this is Alpha and its beta cuz beta goes boring Up in the Air Day. Write. That's how you remember you will never forget that it's stupid enough mnemonics have to be easy to remember but stupid enough to remember so, you know, you have that you have that is so the beta for me up in the air or the Greeks would ride it bowing.  Okay. So one of these horrible lazy carbohydrate chemistry, you know, it's sort of like a Lego you have a no age that can link to another one and you have an LH are they can make you another one so you can make a polymer of his sister has components and so it depends how you simple linkage makes all of the difference between spaghetti and would it makes all the difference between everything so when you have an alpha one for so you think this Alpha and beta houses down menu in alpha 1 4 linkage?  This is how they write that Alpha One for is the sugar on this end. What's called? The did non reducing and is called the reducing you have to know that but that's fit term when it's Alpha One for this is easily digestible by humans and by the gut okay when it's beta 1 4  Meaning it's just instead of this for making the linkages to this for making a language is harder to draw that is completely undigested Vil by nearly all organisms. Okay, so so alpha 1 4 linkages are starches or glycogen and glycogen not coincidentally is called animal starch. That's what it was. First name goes first discovered in liver tissue and so starch and glycogen are long Polymers of alpha 1/4 lengths glucose that also has occasional branches that are alpha one-six. And as I say, you probably are there in this several times in your science flights, you know, I probably did try you talking about in junior high now for all I know and so glycogen is the animal storage version of glucose low osmolality. You can have a lot of in the tissue without messing with the osmotic strength. What's funny. I want to be left out.  Cheetah laughing. I don't feel left out, but I know they're just having their moment. Okay, so, okay, so we have a and then and then plants store starch and it's a little less Branch would have basically exactly like like it's it and that sort of shown here. However, when you wink at Alpha One for mrs. I mean beta-1 for so this is you know, the the one carbon going upwards and then linking to the four carbon in a polymer it is a whole different.  It literally is a difference between sugar and sweet and would you know, I like that I can eat cellulose, which is one version of this a long polymer of beta one for glucose is essentially not hydrolyzable by most organisms. You might have to hire a microorganism in their gut to metabolize beta-1 for sale that hard even the mighty termite that is the wood eater par exsalonce needs to recruit a eukaryote that lives in its gut in order to hydrolyzes. So it's for some reason you think there must be a lot of organisms that would capitalize on that readily available glucose is eating but for some reason beta link cellulose is very hard to metabolize it last a long time. We can build houses with it or example from this simple difference is a is a hugely important. Okay. So this is actually a really useful review and very useful.  Thinking about nutrition and metabolism is just I I found this and after the lecture material I said this is actually really useful. So you have simple carbohydrate. So you probably heard this from complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates, you know, people will admonish you to eat complex carbohydrates in a void simple carbohydrates in its benefits. Do you know too much of anything? But basically what we're talking about is 3/3 dozens of monosaccharides, you need to understand that there is no sin Rich Rosen is all sorts of saccharide than they do play Parts in biology with the main important ones for nutrition and diet are glucose fructose and galactose. Okay, and they're usually delivered to us and informs of disaccharides. Like when you eat an ice cream cone a lot of that sugar is sucrose, you know, and when you when you are  Weather and when you drink milk, a lot of the sugar in milk is lactose. When you ferment yogurt a lot of that fermentation is through lactose being fermented and then there is maltose which is 2 glucose is and that's a result of starch breakdown and some other sources to and table sugar is sucrose which is glucose and fructose. So they're there, you know, these disaccharides that are super common. We see them all the time OK and then the on the other side of other ended out of the polysaccharides, which I just described it length. And so now there's not that many of them. They are in a we have the plant starches we have glycogen, which is really the animal version. It starts with, you know, Alpha 1 4 linkage is with the occasional Alpha one-six Branch. Okay, and then really the only difference between glycogen and starch at least in that sense is the degree of branching the truth is there's more to it and then 102 each about how glycogen has a central protein called glycogen and that's used to started going or not going to talk about  That's not that sort of a little bit to two tree and not enough for us for this class. But glycogen has some very important differences in terms of How It's Made and stored in the liver. But in terms of the carbohydrate chemistry in the carbohydrate availability is very very similar. Okay. And so then you have a slight versions like a milosis straight-chain amylopectin has branched chain glycogen is stored in both muscle and liver and has different Fades and then you have these indigestible as you might think the indigestible aren't so interesting because we can't metabolism wrong. So the indigestible fiber indigestible polysaccharide, you're actually incredibly interesting both medical and microbiological you in terms of our inner play with them and we're going to talk at some length about dietary fiber in this and the next lecture and so they basically divided into two categories soluble would like pectins and that kind of thing.  Insoluble like cellulose is like when you eat a salad, you know, a lot of that is cellulose and it just passes through you you might think not interesting very interesting. So we will talk about and many of the benefits of the police of the carbohydrates. We eat actually arise from these indigestible. Once they have many benefits benefits the carbohydrates without talking about glycogen by glycogen is really dumb name way that I insult you to write it here even cuz I know the glycogen is Supercenter, you probably heard about it many times if you took 108 we talked about glycogen Ad nauseam cuz it's so important for maintaining performance in and then exercised but glycogen is actually the main way we store carbohydrates weather. We've adjusted them or made them and restoring some of them that way and it's really a big thing about glycogen. That's great is this  Polymeric structure of going Apple in for alkaline for iPhone for Cajun 16 Appling for iPhone is that creates a storage molecule? It's really smart because if you just had you know, a few hundred grams of glucose soluble an individual molecules in the liver the osmotic pressure would be gargantuan it would Lysol the cells the cool thing is when you start bonding the molecules together, you don't gain the osmotic power of each individual monomer you get the single particle. So you can store huge numbers of glucose monomers as starch or if your plant or or glycogen if you're a liver a muscle cell, so that's how we store most of our glucose in the bloodstream itself. If you take the blood and you compute the 72 100 Megs per deciliter. It's about 4 grams of glucose. So in any one time the actual amount of glucose in your bloodstream is incredibly small amount of it.  Although you might have stored or being jestic. It's a tiny amount that we've controlled pretty pretty rigorously so are glycogen stores are about 450 G are so weird about 500 grams of like that. We store about a hundred grand liver about 400 grams in a mess. I mean, this is these two don't add up and I apologize for that. But the point is that there in those Ballpark and it depends on muscle mass what you mean, you know, a lot of different things your your your hormone on metabolism through these are just ballpark figures, you know, but the important thing is that they have very different states. Okay. So the glycogen in the liver is almost totally used to release glucose in the blood stream. So liver glycogen is used in liver's function as a glucose data thing that controls glucose muscle glycogen glucose monomers that are cleaved off of one of the ends of the chain. They're high.  July's by glycogen phosphorylase what you've learned about we talked a little about it here, but you've learned about it and 102 those glucose subunits cannot be released into the bloodstream a muscle cell can only use the glucose it releases in its own cytoplasm. Has anyone know why?  sister faded distant memory Muse the 5-second roller  It's phosphorylated. So how come the liver can release it?  close is that the transporter but your clothes it actually pertains to the first answer s  Glucose 6 phosphatase Band 3 part answer boom related has to get out can't do with a phosphorylation. It's so liver has glucose 6 phosphatase. It's only found in that tissue and it releases free glucose. So the liver is the giver and muscles don't have that phosphatase Towing glucose is is released from glycogen as one phosphorylated form that gets converted to another but it never can be on phosphorylated can't get out. Okay, so that's that's actually super important to meaning I want this means in terms of energy metabolism stuff. You only have about a hundred grams of glucose stored available to provide to the bloodstream, you know, as as glucose molecules, it's really not a lot of Headroom is I'll show you in a minute. Okay, so  Soviet this is some of the uses of glycogen and insoluble fiber is the important categories are better 1/4 lengths polymers that can't be digested unless you're a termite and so I'm or a microorganism so meet soluble fibers. I did they have a bunch of different Behavior. So they are found in things like pectins gums mucilages are different names for different sizable fibers and they have to do with the specific company composition molecular size, but they're basically non hydrolyzable glucose polymers. So they dissolve and swallowing water and their fermented by bacteria in the colon to make things like organic acids and many other small molecules and are they have a lot of interesting effects in what's pretty cool is there I'll talk about soon as they're all of these clear epidemiological and large study Health been  Fits of fiber that are real, you know, I'm a impact on an incredible number of different syndromes and physiological state. So it's kind of being able to be kind of amazing and and people are passing out where that comes from what it's about and then there's also inside able fiber like cellulose and Hemi cellulose. He's with a larger virus that makes stems of plants and stuff like that. They don't dissolve in water and they're actually poorly for mended by kehlani Factory. They just basically passed through but they have structural features that are super important for your health and well-being. Okay. So this is sort of a review of the digestion of carbohydrates and I actually had to expand this cuz it was kind of small and this is sort of a little map of the of the GI tract in some of the accessory organs. So some Stark is broken down in the saliva, you know with you probably heard of salivary amylase and are even easier to cool high school experiments. Were you show hydrolysis of starch that way?  There's something so salivary amylase is inactivated by the stomach but then their enzymes produced by the pancreas, you know, like a starch amylase is that help break that down there enzymes in the wall of the small intestine is brush border enzymes that that sit there and they do a bunch of different processes including breaking down breaking down disaccharides. So enzymes in the small intestine break down disaccharides and sucrose lactose and maltose if you don't have those for instance if someone doesn't isn't able to break down lactose like a lactose intolerant person that disaccharide passes into the gut where then it becomes part of the ferment of party, you know, so that's it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it that the microbiome is in the last part of the GI tract. So if you don't get a chance to metabolize it then it ends up in this very complex ecosystem in in a bacteria or just champions of metabolizing things. It's amazing how many things there bacteria?  Can live on a pool of benzene people discover these microorganisms bacteria that can sit and form a colony on pure Benzene and use that as a carbon Source. I just crazy what bacteria can do and I don't know hyper focused on the card. So then you have option of glucose fructose and galactose in the small intestine and then some soluble fiber is fermented in the gut also ran in the large intestine. So there's so there's further processing some of the graduate in that can supply different things to us also started the map of it. But critically when you produce glucose through these beautiful amylases, you know working these these these enzymes. How does the glucose get from the small intestine into the bloodstream supercritical?  There's a sodium glucose transporter sglt1.  Sglt1 this transporter get sort of short shrift because you only hear about glute one-two-three-four. Those are the sort of Rockstar glucose Transporters that are regulated by things like insulin and they're involved a different ones different issues. And there was the glute Transporters are ones that just uniporters. They move glucose across a membrane in facilitated diffusion that shown on here but you get the glucose into the gut it actually is a completely different kind of Transport. I was just going to co transport in which is sodium ion is used to go down a grade in and pull the glucose and at the same time. So the sodium-glucose transport to one is called that because it transports both sodium and glucose simultaneously and then there are pumps on the other side of the of the epithelium intestinal epithelium that keep the sodium keep the sodium out to make a gradient. Okay, so it pumps it out. So there's a it's an energy requiring process to keep the sodium levels low.  And that causes a gradient that pulls the glucose in so here's the bluecoats going that way. Once the glucose is in the brush the end of epithelium cells to hear the Little Brush borders in the microvilli. So this is the this is the Lumen of they got. Okay and this is the basal surface in the bloodstream, you know, the the lacteals and the capillaries are bathed in that fluid may take up the glucose. So you have to see the reason I made these this guy gray is because the epithelial cells are white and it's almost impossible to tell what the cells look like without the background there. So so that's how glucose is absorbed through this sodium glucose co-transporter and a lot of a lot of sports beverages. One of the reasons they have sodium in them is to help you absorb the glucose by creating a gray day is good for exercise. Anyway, so he wasn't what's the deal with all this stuff. Like are these things just bad for us?  What are the benefits of having these carbohydrates with all of this press were getting you know, and so I want to just talk about some of the benefits of carbohydrates. I mean the real problem is the carbohydrates are so great for us that we evolved incredibly elaborate detection and acquisition systems over the million years of evolution of the human version of primate to seek out it consumed and ultimately cultivate package in Market these molecules. They the reason that there's a problem is because it's so great to have them and we have very elaborate systems that confirm that every step of the way. Okay, so I want to make sure to make it clear that these are very beneficial molecules. Like this really know better fuel than glucose. And if any of you do any kind of sports, I'm sure you know this because you can actually Discover it for yourself. But so here are some of the benefits of carbohydrates support glycogen reserves in muscle.  Supports glycogen reserves in liver protects against ketosis and protein loss and I'll go over that and provides fiber. So this is the non-digestible portion. But all of these are important when I talk about all of them and one of the things to remember is that blood glucose, as I said before is normally kept between us 70 in about a hundred message grams of 3 milligrams is a grave error you'd be dead. It's milligrams per deciliter. So forgive me for that and 3.9 millimolar is quite clear that glycogen reserves in a muscle are very beneficial to carbohydrates and there's a number of ways to show that they're probably one of the best ways to just do a simple at performance experiments. So you probably heard of you know about carbo-loading and glycogen reserves. And if you go to the gym people say they're tired to go on Blanco and I run out of glycogen, you know, there's a tournament in Endurance Sports bunker.  Which means you can run out of glycogen and it's actually easy to experiences go run 20 miles of my needing something and you will bomb and I've done that and it feels very unpleasant. And so it's it's a real thing in a very easy way to show this is you can take people and end change their glycogen stores in measure what they are in the muscles involved and have them do a ride to exhaust you next time you put them on a bicycle or an ergometer just have them pedal as hard as they can until they can or pedal at a certain intention to they can't and that's called a ride to exhaustion experiment really actually great ways to study a lot of different sports physiology. So this is a beautiful ride to exhaustion experiment and is typical of sports physiology that you got a lot of wobble in the day that you know, people are different. We're all completely different from each other. So when you get this kind of uniform in an experiment like this, it's pretty meaningful, but these are just going to gym content of muscle measured in different individuals at the  Sometimes in this is the work time. This is the time they could work until they no longer could work anymore sza voluntary quitting experiment and correlation and you have the longer you can work in these active muscles. It's a really useful fuel store in it's the fuel storage choice for high-intensity activity high-intensity exercise. Okay, let me say that. Okay, so hold everything if your powerlifting for a few seconds, but we won't go and we can talk about that for a whole quarter like in 108 but we won't okay, so then supports glycogen reserves in the liver. So the muscle is all about the activity of those individual muscle and liver. It's all about providing glucose for the rest of the organisms or liver is very sparing and its usage of its own glucose is stored as it is synthesized is it and it releases into the bloodstream by you said that glucose 6 phosphatase that was mentioned in the section. Okay, so the main  Reason that deliver does this is to keep that blood level. Comparative blood level at between, you know FM between 1700 and listen to vet students at the University of Wisconsin. Call Cynthia glucose imperative. He says that you can you can figure out all of metabolism by just anchoring all of it at the point that group as has to be kept at a certain level in all of the metabolism sort of orbits around that imperative. It's an interesting way to look at it. So in that sense, the reason for that is your brain absolutely needs a certain level of cops flexible. You can go down but if you go too low and not a lot of not 10 times, do we just a couple fall to low you start getting clearer neurochemical and neurological effects. So it's real important for glucose to be provided by the brain and when that happens glycogen from the liver is released into the blood by the snack as we talked about it and it goes right to the brain.  Now if if you have low blood low liver glycogen and you have to be providing glucose the way it happens is amino acids and glycerol. This thing is kind of crazy. It did amino acids and glycerol are used to produce glucose. So I'm hoping you know that the the three or they two molecules you can make are the two types of molecules. You can make glucose from are glycerol and immune to certain amino acids to produce Krebs cycle intermediates that are bigger than a pseudocoelom. That's it. That's the first thing ramifications in terms of what happens when you start starving because certain molecules can be mobilized and certain can't be okay sad fatty acids can't cuz we have an abundance or is it fatty acids a huge stores? If a bit of fat? Okay now glycerol from fat can be used to remember a triglyceride is glycerol with Three fatty acids to a little bit of it can be used. Okay, so when  When glycogen slow you have to have gluconeogenesis producing glucose. Okay. So another benefit of carbohydrates as it protects against ketosis and protein loss is so what is ketosis? I want to try to explain this this is something that is very useful to understand. It will actually be useful in that. It's sort of in the regular World cuz anyone ask you about the ketogenic diet is orbiting around this whether they know it or not is when you have the Krebs cycle, so here is acetylcholine.  Coming in with oxaloacetate to make citrate and then you go around. You know, you can Isis it rate.  You have a house of Keto butyrate.  And you have your license Scituate alpha-ketoglutarate and then you have sex in old koay.  Succinylcholine then succinate and then you were eight and I'm not late and oxaloacetate know to expect you to 15 years of material that I probably am missing something. So important point. Is it any molecule that enters the Krebs cycle anywhere around here from other metabolism, you can make glucose cuz this is how you make glucose and you steal oxaloacetate from the Krebs cycle. And you said pep carboxykinase. If you have pyruvate you can take pyruvate make that that's how people usually teach it and that gives you eventually glucose right when glucose is low and the liver is going to make me some glucose does the brain is going to demand it and we'll die. Okay, when it's a Japanese you start diverting molecules into the glucose flow.  And you also different amino acids into these various intermediates and then go up this way to happening is the usage of the Krebs cycle is completely dedicated to making glucose. And in the meantime, the liver is using fatty acids for its fuel cuz you know that fatty acid oxidation produces nadh and fadh2 you get energy molecule. That is a great source of energy is happening is when the liver is being told to make glucose and is not available. The Krebs cycle is running only in this way. You're actually stealing molecules from the Krebs cycle reactivity. Krebs cycle slow oxidation is super high seeing a buildup of acetylcholine in a normal functioning. Kreb cycle is the acetates going to see her too. So what are Ketone bodies made from?  Anybody remember?  That's what they are. But what are they made from? This one source molecule is used to make Ketone bodies.  Anybody remember?  Nope.  Sealco relay. So what school is a ceiling fan builds up in the when you need glucose acetyl Titans 2 build up because this is being diverted to glucose fatty acids be used to fuel the liver. So you have lots of acetyl-coa molecules that make Ketone bodies can be produced by the liver. They can't be used by the liver, but they were great alternate fuel for most of the tissues including the brain. So in situations of the liver is being taxed to make glucose. It's also making another fuel Ketone bodies that can be used by the rest of the body since this beautiful adaptation to to help spare the glucose. It's precious a by making another fuel that's a result of this problem. So that's where I'm Goin In This is actually a summary of all that okay. This chart would be useful to study later, but it's actually just showing you that when you need to make glucose hear protein is diverted to make Krebs cycle Molly.  Krebs cycle molecules used to make glucose fatty acids are taken up and metabolizes Sudoku a buildup and then because just the km of the of the keto body enzymes is pretty high. It only starts making lots of them when he is he look away level gets high and she start making this alternate fuel. It's really kind of beautiful and to what people are doing people for many years. They ketosis with something bad that was pathological but that probably is not the case. There's an incredible experiments you can take people give them easily accessible Ketone bodies, which is not easy to do you have to do some chemistry to get them accessible and then test those people they'll do athletics or other physical activities in Melbourne as Ketone bodies, beautifully. It's actually a great fuel. It's even if you would have some preference. So now what people are doing is manipulating your diet in order to make this happen. Naturally, they'll eat very few carbs believe lots of fats it into the liver easily and they'll actually create a ketotic state.  Making it by making glucose scares. So this is an interesting idea and there are there are there are athletes who swear by the ketonic by the they think it's just completely out their performance the other people don't like it. It's probably very individual but this is sort of the logic of Ketone body synthesis and I think it will help if you sit back and read this. Okay. So when the important point that was when glucose is abundant, this doesn't happen and glucose is abundant you had substantial flow of pyruvate through this Krebs cycle and you have sufficient production of glucose in the bloodstream that you're not demanding the liver make glucose by gluconeogenesis glucagon as well. And so it's really allows this state to not occur. It's low glucose it triggers all of this on ketogenic Mayhem. Okay, so then you can start talking about starvation. So I really should have talked about a version of glucose starvation and it's interesting to think about starvation.  I know this is the opposite of nutrition I starvation is naan nutrition. But it after he teaches you how we use our different resources in fuel. So they said there's a progression to starvation and actually humans can go in incredibly long time without eating. It's amazing how long a person can go if they just eat have some water and some minerals and there's a reason for that if we evolve through thousands of cycles of feast and famine, you know, the normal human experience was when things are good we eat and when things are. We survived and that's actually a great darwinian mechanism to develop storage modalities that work super. Well, you know, there's a so, this is actually what happens if your glycogen gets depleted is just if you're sitting on a raft or something and then then you start depleting fat and protein and after a week and slow protein degradation occurs lipids primary fuel brand uses Ketone bodies. So prolonged exposure to starvation. You start getting high levels of Ketone bodies.  And other tissues use them they're useful fuel. Like if you can't use glucose. Yo use Ketone Bodies Okay, so prolonged starvation, the amino acids be converted to DC and immediate make glucose lipid stores power. The liver ketosis is high and muscle weighs. We have been Steve main way you make a mean make glucose in Starvation is amino acids. That's why your muscles start wasting is that the primary source of amino acids. Unfortunately unlike the liver. There's no amino acid storage Depot. It's all just your muscles. So so it kind of makes some sense is actually a pretty telling picture of what happens to different fuel sources during starvation. I want you notice how little the carbohydrates are we compared to fat and protein we store very very little bits of carbohydrate. We have to constantly replenishing it. So this is showing a sort of progress of starvation. Oh my gosh.  Because we got maybe a minute is there so there are reasonable requirements for carbohydrates. I mean, I hope at least you convince you that they're super there a fuel of choice the brain needs them. It's a good way to avoid overabundant ketosis. It's a good way to avoid muscle wasting which happens as a consequence of long term low carb. This is why people on the ketogenic diet need to eat a lot of protein too. And so be the daily requirement is 52/108 grams of carbs a day. So they recommended daily allowance is 130 grams for the interests me is the average consumption in the US is between 180 and 330 grams of carbs a day. So as if population are eating a whole lot more than is recommended her probably use for I will stop there and I will definitely have a look at these questions. "
