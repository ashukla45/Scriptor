There's a lot of David Airline information and I'm going to review a little teeny bit of it that I wanted to swear to go over my own way, but I do understand that. It is jarring. Are you to have a completely different lecturer and I will in bed that in my thinking let's see what else he died. Now also know he didn't have one of these so wait what's going on?  Wow, is the battery dead?  Whatever it is. He didn't have one of these so you guys are at a loss like I watch the podcast watched. It couldn't tell where the pointer was what? Hello. Okay, so we're going to talk a bit about protein, but I wanted to go if you over a few other things and talking teeny little bit about lipids. I just to clarify a few things that I sort of knew. Everyone has their own way of describing the same thing. And you know, I I appreciate that. So I wanted to start it at least put my mark on it, First of all, I guess the most Salient issue as we're having an exam. It's an unfortunate consequence of the current academic structure with a large a large room fast like this out. Let me turn them. I know something to ask to turn the mic up, so I'll turn up.  Alright by little better, okay, I anticipated see that. Okay. So the exam is if you taking my exams before it's you know, the usual stop it's short answers write a sentence or two when I want an explanation could be simple you have right of regrade so you shouldn't be afraid. I'm very very cool about three grades. Like I don't ever threaten to regrade the test or look for things that are wrong when you ask her regret. I'm against that I think it's just using fear to keep people from asking for what they deserve and I trusted if you have a 96 you won't ask for a re-grade now, I mean, you should usually get what you deserve. That's my feeling and the process allows learning. So what I try to do is put the key up as soon as possible after the exam so people can learn from it. Okay. So all you need is a pen and your brain you don't need any of those camping gear that you have to carry the modern student you don't  Pup tent you don't need a tire jack just need a pen and you need a pain because I will only take regrets if you've written in pen. I thought that was kind of obvious but some student quarterback crazy cuz I didn't announce that you can't get a read rate. If you use a pencil with struck me is kind of obvious. It's like if you don't open your mouth or nose, you can't breathe oxygen but better tell everyone. Okay anyway, so I'm telling you a pain equals regrade. Okay, it's short answer is sentence fill in diagram some. True false a kind of thing. The total is 200 points, but we actually wait to assign the credit afterwards so we can do it in the most Fair way because there's multi-component stuff but it's roughly a point or two per unit of information. It doesn't seem to be that big a deal to do it after it makes our grading much easier in fair to do that. Let's see how it's going to go up through today and I will revise the study list.  Not today, so they'll be there at 9 and I'm not going to emphasize that I've actually looked at the protein lecture and I've taken out some of the coolest and most complicated stuff things like celiac disease gluten for next time because I want to be able to cover that in a gradual and interesting because those are super important issues in modern nutrition and I don't want a zoom through them. So it'll be the basics. Let's see what else I've never written a nutrition test before. So I take that into account I grade on a curve it might be too hard and might be too easy together. We'll figure it out were inventing this wheel together and I'm all about everyone having the minimum stress for the maximum amount of learning. I looked at Nigel's those tests and I promise you you'll be glad I wrote mine because it was freaking hard. I guess he's sort of a hippie type guy vegan, but he gives a hard test.  Can you use nose and a little bit I might have you read a little bit before you answer, you know the drill, you know, this is our world of words about science. Okay, so we're going to have some reviews the I-80 Azor doing a review for you guys tomorrow. So on that schedule of classes it actually it says midterm there but you all know that that's not a midterm. I just needed to book that room is a midterm for the powers-that-be to give us the room. But the cool thing is we now have that room solid infected this room. So you come here at 8 p.m. Tomorrow and it will be podcast so you can listen to it if you want to I'm not sure how many people actually listen to the review podcast but they feel good that they exist. So that's great. I can get a feel comfortable so I can sleep for a couple hours and then study some more so, it's cool. I'm going to have this is my office hours at sprunk my office hours normal time 324 Pacific  Wednesday are these are both on Wednesday.  Here's how the Masters do it. Check it out. Here is how the Masters doing? Okay. Hold on making tricks who I guess I'm not.  What the hell?  Okay.  Wednesday  I don't know who put that s in there, but it sure makes Wednesday hard. Okay, so ok to nice color.  Okay.  Save it. Okay. So it's Wednesday. Both of those are tomorrow Wednesday. Okay, let's go back.  Yay, so now they fancy huh? Okay, so that's what's going to be and it's usually bring questions, you know, but it's it's useful to bring questions, you know yet but probably many of you like me are firefighters instead of Architects and you do stuff on the fly when it's an emergency. So you maybe aren't sitting around organizing your questions you're so whatever I'm a firefighter. I need those alarms trucks Dogs smoke to get things done 99% of the stuff I've done in my life is cuz I had to and then was glad I did as opposed to wanted to and felt I should do that. So I'm not criticizing you the thing is just as good to know what kind of phenotype you have. Also. This is little side thing. Someone left this lovely phone on their seat. We pretty much expect it was someone from last class but the student Adventure that maybe they get it to save their seat. I'll be a pretty trusting.  Hey, I left my phone and you're sitting there. I didn't see your phone. But if it's your phone, but I'm sure it's from someone that last time I see the exams at one of the things. I wanted to point out as these quiz questions. I definitely draw from the quiz questions for information and ideas from the exams. That's why we're discussing the stuff. I think it's important. I also want you to get together and get to know each other and communicate but discussion material, for example, he may well have some presents on the exam. We've only talked about it like 30 times. So perhaps that would be something you know and end at the level I'm talking about the simple level were talking about what people were talking about it was saying, you know, I don't expect you to get people to the way to that study speaking of that. And so you we have this the actual Zhang a study that you promised to look at with raised right hand and this one which I  Thank you to have read all six pages of it. I can chop it up in the 86 tweets if that would make it easier for you, but it is but read this disgusting discussion section anyway, and it's very conversational. It's not hard to read. Okay. So there's a little more eggs studies plot thickening is we were wondering if we remember I wrote this nice post. Who wrote back with a admirable alacrity and even said I was a humble man so clear he doesn't know me but but I wrote and said, you know, what's the DoD said we use these surveys which is right in the paper and what I really want to know. So I wrote that is super helpful in the students will enjoy seeing the real thing. I'm using you guys to butters on that up. Also. It sends the message did scientists even famous ones. We've been featured in The Press and news that would be him are accessible unresponsive. You are helping make the students appreciate the dynamic and interactive nature of our scientific culture.  I can lay it on thick my people. No problem. Okay, and maybe final question is how often where the cohort members query about their diets during the protective it he's just said that you serve it was this or similar form used once to get an idea of all time or what is the form filled out multiple times by each co-14. I'm not sure that's a real word. Thanks. Okay. So we really want to know this because this is 2017 to 20 years of people's eating habits. How do they know what those habits are so strong rope back right away. Thank you for your kind words. No humble man. Just I'm sorry for the delay. I just arrived home a couple of hours ago. I checked emails during travel see where like buds now me and I didn't turn on automatic replies and a page 5 of the supplement attached you will see that each cohort may have Diet data collected one two, or three times points in 17 years.  The longest follow-up was about three decades in our study. We only use one earliest diet measurement for the analysis. This is the key so that use one survey showed that once to get the eating habits for the entire study interesting. It almost sounds like a cross-sectional approach to a prospective study as cross-section was at one moment, right interesting. Just keep that in mind. All right, once again reinitiating are bold experiment. I know that Nigel didn't do this. I think he has a flip phone actually. No, I'm kidding. I'm driving to United. Actually. I think he's actually slightly younger than me. He looks beautiful cuz he's a plant eater. Right? So it's as if we have discussions are the mid-term review do we go to their view discussion the mid-term review the people have discussion in mid-term review. You don't have to have discussion this week. You can go to the review you will be only build fortnine discussions as opposed to 10 because you would lose  Hang out your discussion section and you're still welcome to go to other ones if you want to discuss if you want a quiz scuss okay with you, I'm home. Right, right. Okay. Alright, so I wanted to talk a little bit more about some of these things that that not doing over beautifully about lipoproteins to the basic problem is that lipids are very good for us. I mean lipids get a bad rap that is bad. But the fact is it's an absolutely major and unbelievably energy-rich macro and micronutrients. We now know from these studies of burned that lipids are also incredibly important micronutrients a little low levels of some of those weapons are incredibly important for brain function blood function circulation blood pressure, you know, all the kind of things that you talked about concerned about prostaglandins Intercoast annoyed and thromboxane.  Leukotrienes those things that we talked about but the problem is getting them around the blood another one thing. What's the one bio physical feature of lipids is incontrovertible and always a problem blue jeans get stained when you drop butter on them.  That water and soluble Nature has come up with some incredibly wonderful solutions for how to move lipids in basically an aqueous environment blood plasma cells are you know, organelle juice? It's all water. It's all basically aqueous and that is the lipoprotein. So there's several classes of lipoproteins in this is a generic lipoprotein. So this is not any one particular any important thing is remember how phospholipids learn this now in high school is phospholipids hydrophilic, you know, they love water hydrophilic. Yay a nice guys.  Hate water is hydrophobic hate water love water in these structures. These phospholipid structure has caused the molecules that form basically a support group, you know, they get together and they can do better together in water than they can do individually and phospholipids are so incredibly inside water. There's no such thing as a free solo. You can't even find a free bottle of a molecule are vesicles that are the basis of all membrane baselite the lipoprotein a little bit different. The lipoprotein is a phospholipid monolayer. It actually creates a shell of hydrophilic. The pink stuff II was pointed at the screen the pace of the head groups of the phospholipid enable learned about a few of them you seen instructors are glycerol with that phosphate and something charge and then the head group so they have a hydrophilic and hydrophobic portion and soda.  Scarface is the water and says I love water. I'm sorry about all this part faces inside and they go we hate water. We don't want to be around it until all the hydrophobic molecules hang out in here sort of like the Crypt episode of Game of Thrones, you know.  I don't know what happened to that Crypt.  Just use the pointy end. So anyway, I'm okay. So this this is an absolutely amazing storage and transport device these like all you have to do. If you ever get your plasma drawn like for a scientific study or something like that in this plenty of people do this on campus. If you eat a rich meal for breakfast like with lipids in it, and then you have your blood plasma drawn. It is amazing. It is like milk and color it is so it scatters light so much it almost looks milky. You might figure I can big trouble with that is a completely normal part of these these lipoproteins in the blood.  Are produced in the intestinal tissue the intestinal cells a take up the triglycerides? Remember the triglycerides are broken down into monoglycerides and fatty acids and then amazingly reassembled back into triglycerides inside the cell along with steroids to get taken up cholesterol cholesterol Esters and they get packaged into these beautiful chylomicrons and the important point to understand if it means this basic structure is relatively similar to a very bad composition, but there's a media and the real difference between different lipoproteins are there proteins that are part of than they each have actual proteins that are embedded in that half a membrane and they tell the rest of the world. What kind of A lipoprotein they are and LDL has certain April lipoproteins on if it says I'm in LDL and it'll bind to an LDL receptor and HDL high-density lipoprotein has a different April protein that says I'm in HDL and I interact with cellular services in a different way. These things are different lipid composition.  Lewin's full of different amounts of are they have very different molecular signature is cuz a proteins that are on them. Okay, and so they are and they're made in cells and energy converted ways that actually make a lot of sense and I just I thought that didn't come through that much. So all these are decorated with a embedded proteins called April lipoproteins.  Have a great name because you might think lipoprotein April lipoproteins. But then these are the proteins that are in integral a part of each lipoprotein. Okay, you can purify them and save near very hydrophobic. They usually don't exist. Well, except embedded in A lipoprotein. Okay. So this is over it again literary term different sizes and shapes and they have different compositions with the important point is they have actual all of them have biological functions. It would be a very wrong idea to think that LDL is just bad LDL is an unbelievably important part of normal lipid biology. The problem comes when the levels are too high and they linger too long in the circulation people a hundred thousand years ago did not have elevated LDL unless they had some mutation of rare mutation that costed to be high. Okay. So this is another point of these all have fun.  Different composition to chylomicron that emerges from the intestine and starts delivering lipids is full of triglycerides. They're all so big and they have and then you have vldl switch to produce. We'll talk about it when they are slightly different composition of triglycerides glycerol Esters, they have phospholipid shell and they had these able proteins that say, you know, I am I am of this rhyme of that. That's basically how it goes. Okay. And so this is this lovely the circulation picture this is slightly more modern one. That's basically what happens is chylomicrons emerged from the intestine and there's a mover on the circulation and the important thing is there's a beautiful enzyme lipoprotein lipase.  lipase  and these enzymes are on the end of the illegal cells as the lipoproteins for the triglycerides at the surface of the inside service by providing a fatty acids are delivered. So they're really like a newspaper delivery who's throwing papers out there throwing fatty acids out to the South and so as these lipoproteins travel through the blood they get stripped of some of their triglycerides trip to some of their fatty acid and they change their composition. So chylomicrons do this and they end up in the liver and then deliver it because his liver is just unbelievably active organ for metabolism takes up these lipids and repackages them into a different lipoprotein. So the movie why won't you realize is it lipoproteins are made by a labret. So biological process use their made in the secretory system as packages and then they are secreted just like other protein snow through the goal.  3D another maxo cytosis. Oh there they have an elaborate cell biology that people study people make a living study. You can go to Scientific conferences are about nothing but lipoprotein and there are people who study individual classes of lipoproteins for their whole career because they're so intricate and so involved in so much medicine. So the point of making hear this is just the tip of the iceberg just the tip of the elbow protein on an entire life of protein that were talking about. We just I just want you to get a flavor for these days, you know, the flavor will be good cuz there lipids and lipids are delicious. That was a sort of a nerdy joke. Okay. So so then deliver what the liver does is packaged new lipoproteins called V LDL and vldl are very low density lipoproteins easy thing to remember is lipoproteins high protein that that is dense and lipids that are the float that are low-density. So nice things of the higher that the lower the density the more lipid content it has  Gordon thing to remember because it was strictly done just by PPL Center Fusion these things and seeing what the fractions look like. These names are not very deep in terms of telling you anything about the function are just useful. No make what's the liver produces vldl they circular around they get stripped of fatty acids to and then what's called a vldl remedy gets take it there. And there's a cycle of this going on some of the vldl levels when they get sufficiently stripped of lipids become ldls and ldls are rich in cholesterol than one cool thing. Is there a marker the April protein that labels vldls the same is a marker protein that labels LDL they have the same flag on their surface. I'm sure they're very closely related. And here's another thing. It's important to realize is ldl-c. If you were to listen to some things are if you go to the internet and read the wrong thing you think that the only thing ldls do is go back to the liver or do bad things review nefarious activity ldls are a major delivery source of cholesterol.  And every single cell in your body has LDL receptors to take up ldls to get cholesterol. It's an absolutely essential molecule. The point is there's a sweet spot for all the hours that you don't want to go to high on and back. We didn't evolve a good mechanisms for dealing with LDL when we you know have a western-style diet because there was no problem with that for a million years LDL levels were pretty low all the time because you had to walk 8 hours to get a meal and then you had to kill it or hunted or dig it out. So, you know things have changed. Maybe that's a good thing. I don't love the idea of hunting every day for my food. That would be really distracting and no Game of Thrones you'd be doing that stuff. So, okay anyway, but ldls can also I may go back to the liver. The only trouble this area should also be an arrow celebrity says LD on taking up by receptor Pathways in body cells Nexus liver liver takes him up and reprocessing. So this is constant turn of making of the out the problem is that  Bealls also can become part of an aberrant and pathological structure called and atherosclerosis plaque. And this is why we're talking about in terms of medicine. But this is the important functions of each of the El Sol chylomicrons carry dietary fats in the small intestine this primary by the liver to sell so they need their spit out my liver for more delivery and then fuzhou because the liver makes a substantial amount of cholesterol LDL carry cholesterol from the vldl cholesterol made up by the liver from and from other sources. And then finally it is HDL and HDL are really the most maybe some of the most interesting lipoprotein cuz they do what's called reverse cholesterol transport and you might wonder why is it everyone calls HDL the good cholesterol and LDL the bad cholesterol and the answer is that HDL has a very special cell biology and a very special April protein.  It makes it different from the other ones and it's able to take cholesterol out of cells and move it back in the liver out of areas where it where you could have problems and also improve clearance cuz they lip de colesterol the show that never gets metabolize and removed is bile salts and end and gotten rid of as well as being put back into vldl this a number of different faiths Grasso HDL tends to lower cholesterol in tissue and LDL tends to increase hips make some sense in and there's all sorts of medical studies of high high HDL is a good thing for her health. Some of the reasons are obvious and some of them are not so obvious. It's more of an empirical thing at this stage. The real problem is that if ldls linger too long in the circulation, meaning of high levels or other problems at 10 to 2 to exacerbate this condition, you can start forming aberrant deposits of cholesterol from ldls on a pro scooter otic back. So I called this after a Genesis which just means the beginning of app  Sclerosis and you heard about atherosclerosis. So atherosclerosis is and that you had that all beautifully just shown to you and not just like those are not going to go over again, but in arterial tissue in the air and helium, there can be the sudden uptake of ldls into an aberrant structure called Annapolis carotid plaque and this starts with a kind of cell called a white blood cell or a macrophage that can take ability Allison start making a stable deposit. This actually creates a pretty complex cycle of inflammatory responses that we're not going to go into but the bottom line is after us go out of Black start having their own existence that's highly stable and they happen in blood vessels that some blood vessels is not a big deal, but some blood vessels to see huge deal like the coronary arteries or the vessels of the brain. So when they now people now think of Apple's product box may play a role in some kinds of senility to okay, and this is why people my age all go have cardiac stress test to see if there's  Electrophysiological or Imaging evidence of clogging of the arteries and it's very drastic. I have a friend skinny dude rides bikes. He went and got a cardiac stress test and the electrophysiological indications of an apparent heart when he started exercising when blood flow is high in high demand. It can't be met we're so great. They would not let him drive to the hospital. They took him to the hospital to get a stent in to to fill his his his left anterior coronary artery. It's probably a little heteronormative, but they call that the Widowmaker because so many males tend to get that prescribe the clocks there that kill them before they ever have any symptoms. For example, the filmmaker Kevin Smith has made all those crazy movies like Mall Rats and stuff had 100% blockage of coronary artery and by some miracle. He happened to be at the right people got a stent put in became a vegan is lost over a hug.  50 pounds if you Google Kevin Smith the filmmaker, you won't even recognize him anymore. I'm so that's a whole separate thing. We'll talk about more of that later. But the point is he's after sporadic box for super important. Okay, and I meant to say that oxidized LDL is a form of LDL. It's a variant form of LDL that can build up.  Oxidized LDL unlike those other cut of unlike those other lipoproteins has no known function it is it is 8:00 at Barons modification of LDL that can happen when levels are high when other conditions are met that are very well taken up by these phones. So oxidized ldls are extremely Avid depositors in these are through these budding actress go out of class. Now. I'm actually a whole collection of different modifications in their people who study of these to make a living and all of this is is not speculative is too weak of word. It is strong hypotheses. A lot of these models are subject to people figuring out more in one of the world's experts on LVL. Joe wisdom is actually here on campus and I email him whenever I have a question about LDL because he's that highly-placed that researchers. So this is one of the wonderful things about science but also being here is there so many great scientists. You can just reach out to okay, so now we're going to talk about protein.  End up we're going to talk a little bit about protein. How what it's used for what happens when you have enough of it. What are the problems with proteins and diets and then we're not going to talk today. We're going to continue next week with stuff about some of the really interesting dietary aspects of protein become hind of the four friend, like low and high protein diets celiac disease gluten Mania everything we're going to talk about it'll be it'll be interesting. So you all know what proteins are and you know, this is a very strong molecular biology oriented a university and molecular biology oriented major and so you've learned a lot about how proteins are translated from the genetic code and they pulled into these shapes and that you are quite a big section about translation and transcription about protein as a dietary element as a a nutritional  And of course that interfaces with its molecular functions do these things are unrelated and they're not uncoupled but they're couplings are pretty intricate ways. So this is just what about a gross listing of all the functions of proteins in tapeworm enzymes and hormones. They formed are involved in immune function for antibody and other parts of them. They from the building blocks of cellular structures, like acting in tubulin, you know, the nuclear pore all that stuff. Now the interesting ones start becoming where giant are there any important in fluid balance and this is more physiological than entomological there a source of nitrogen when you need nitrogen in your diet, it comes from amino acids. Okay, and it comes from protein are energy-yielding. I definitely hang out for calories per gram in a glucose for calories per gram of protein per calorie alcohol 7 calories per gram and pretend fattest 9 calories per gram. Those are very useful things to know and they're in there one of the main sources of glucose.  Genesis like you now know that Google near Genesis you can only do it with things are glycerol or fat are amino acids that make molecules that make products bigger than a c look away and they are the major source when you're doing gluconeogenesis friends. If you haven't eaten for 20 hours or you know, or if your cat and you make all your glucose by and gluconeogenesis much of that comes in the carbon skeleton from the correct amino acids important. Okay. So the way of being OS get digested it's not really very deep. It's it's not super fancy as they ingest them the pancreas the stomach has some protease is in it and also has an acid environment that helps clear does peptide bonds in In Cahoots with pepsin, which is a stomach enzyme hits acid stimulated to clean polypeptides by hydrolyzing that amide Bond even at U of the pancreas that further provides enzymes pancreatic protease. Has the small intestine.  The final digestion spot in it. It converts into of amino acids dipeptides and tripeptides tripeptide. Just three amino acids in a row chopping a Cuisinart at the molecular level and then you have absorption of those things and then the liver remember the hepatic portal vein takes things from the intestine directly to the liver in the liver is majorly involved in the process of amino acids. The urea cycle that you learned about that is involved in getting rid of nitrogen is happening there. And you also have these these aminotransferase. Is it allow you to to make substrates for a variety of different enzymes that transfer Amino groups from one molecule to another to build things in queso amino acids are absorbed portal vein transport to deliver the Energizer. What's your most of the liver makes dozens of secretory products like bovine serum albumin is made by the liver and it makes lots  Different proteins in the large intestine is a has very little dietary protein ends up in the large intestine. It's all wood sword in use so it's doesn't have a big role in that. Okay. So basically the absorption is really relatively straightforward. It's it's it has a certain Random House you have polypeptides in the stomach, you know, they get put your protein shake lead into these polypeptide fragments in here further prody. Alice's into amino acids dipeptides and tripeptides, you know much of this is not very sequence-specific. Most of the prettiest is have many sites. They'll creep. Okay, and then they get taken up in the end of the Leo cell and you get amino acids dipeptides to get broken down into amino acids and out. They go so it's free beat her ass is just very very rare cases where proteins make it intact through the guy like the one case that's really interesting as these prion diseases like mad cow disease where those proteins are so tough that they actually make it through the digestive process as as  Folded molecules. That's a whole separate thing. Very rare case very very rare. Most the time amino acids are cleaved and proteins are Cleveland amino acids. And so there's a number of functions of these amino acids as a little bit reiterative is, you know, they come from cell breakdown or from diet. They're involved in the synthesis of non-protein nitrogen compounds that we make that have nitrogen in them, like carnitine and carnosine. Those are good examples that we talked about in the sports class Ketone bodies, you know where produced from certain amino acid and glucose is produced and stored amino acids. You have synthesis of proteins. That's a pretty obvious. That's when we're all the way or of you have glucose production. There's a subset of of amino acids that can make glucose through their metabolism and you have energy production directly from burning those, you know, those molecules as they go down there a leper pathway. So one of the things about amino acids that we don't have to cover for  Is every amino acid has at least one catabolic pathway? Some of them have multiple brand catabolic pathway. So there's a lot of ways to chew up amino acids in its, you know, hardcore amino acid biochemist know all these Pathways and that you can bald separate sets of enzymes and they can be very important. Suddenly Along Comes A disease or one of those enzymes missing and you have symptoms and you have a patient and maybe you have no idea how that got made. So this is you know, why we end up studying those kinds of things when we discover an absence of each other's reactions. They're all super important that metabolism that I just this is review again is this idea of glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids and really the bottom line is if an amino acid ends up making something that I can enter the Krebs cycle after the CO2 after at least one of the CO2 steps like alpha ketoglutarate or something or succinate or male down this part of the Krebs cycle those molecules of carbon.  Things can be used directly to make both glucose. Okay, and I'm hoping that's at least that many familiar if your amino acid get squeak gets metabolize so we can make pyruvate and height so you can you get out. I mean to keep telling you get Ketone products out of certain amino acids. When you DM and ate them if if your amino acid is lucky enough to pyruvate than that can be converted into glucose to memorize that 1/3 of pyruvate pyruvate carboxylase hep C K that whole thing. If your amino acid is one that ends up as a final product with your tablet to see look away then it can't be used to make glucose. You can pump to see Tokyo way into the Krebs cycle all day long and you won't get any both production of glucose cuz for every two Seas you put in a receipt of the way you get to CO2 is out. So there's no fault movement of carbon from acetyl-coa into glucose. And this is why these things are called ketogenic because Ketone bodies are made from acetyl-coa as opposed to  It's really as simple as that is the metabolic fate. Okay. So what would be the case for an amino acid being both ketogenic and glucogenic? What would have to be the condition? When do that waiting thing?  Anyone want to Hazard a guess?  That's a poser to metabolic pathways for it.  One would have to result in.  I shout it out.  When will be pyruvate or something some Krebs Cycle Products bigger than two molecules? It's really all you need. What about the other? What would that product be?  Anyone want to take a guess?  Does he look away right? Is he? Okay is how you make Ketone bodies? Okay, you'll figure it out.  That was not a productive pedagogical moment for me. So maybe I'll have to go back to 102. Okay. Let's see. You see people ask about keto diet does fat baby. Okay. Let's see we have is Goshen do people on a keto diet make their glycogen through glucose and gluconeogenesis zero, but if they had no carbohydrates at all, they would be making their glucose from Google new genesis. There's very few Diet Coke Zero carbohydrates. That's pretty rare. Can you curl her if I would an April lipoprotein is good and able lipoprotein is the genetically encoded protein that is incorporated into a lipoprotein that decorates and since he who I am. It's the protein component of A lipoprotein.  Okay, they're also called April protein that that's not a great term because it's it's some it's not quite as specific. Okay, so they're the protein components that say I'm an LVL to the rest of the world to The receptors that bind them that kind of thing glad you asked why do HDL levels increase when we exercise acutely. They chronically increase your metabolic numbers get better. I think there's a number of processes are involved in lipid metabolism and better a comportment can HDL be oxidized or that's a wonderful question their wonderful questions, but that's apparently there is no oxidized HDL. It just doesn't have the right lipid composition oxidized ldls have a lot to do with the fatty acids that are embedded in them. And the chemistry do they can undergo and HDL sound seemed to really do that. But I'm going to look into that. I know the guy who cloned the scavenger receptor in this other thing I can ask  Are lipase is the cells that need the triglyceride or are they done? The lipoprotein himself is lipase is or not on the lipoprotein that they interact with lipoprotein to to hydrolyze. The the lipids can a ketogenic diet cause lower pH in the brain not really your thinking of ketoacidosis. So we really extreme case of Ketone body formation is actual lowering the blood pH but the blood pH in a normal when you're just manipulating your diet in your not sick or near don't have it as syndrome Fairy doesn't change a lot. So I thought I would guess no, okay. Alright, so let's talk about dietary protein deficiencies. There's a number of them. So one of the things it's amazing about dietary protein deficiency. It actually causes extreme water imbalance and it is the reason is purely biophysical. So if you if you've ever done is done with osmotic strength and osmotic pressure, you know, you take off permanent a semi-permeable membrane and you put something like soup.  Listen to close it up and you're in high school and you put in a glass of water in the kissing front of me just ended and it made me even explodes right if there's enough osmotic pressure. Okay, so proteins can impose osmotic pressure that's very important because proteins are big enough molecules that they can't get through the the windows that blood that endothelial cells have for for contents to move out there stuck in the blood. So they provide an osmotic pressure that is very important for maintaining water balance from tissue and when blood flow through a capillary what happens is it blood to the capillary the high pressure at the front of the capillary causes liquid to squeeze out. It's really just like, you know, like squeezing of a cake decorator you squeezing the water out the protein stays in the osmotic pressure goes up and then at the end of the capillary where the pressure is low now the protein can overcome that loss of water and pull the water back in so it creates a real Dynamic water balance.  You don't have protein at sufficient levels of protein in the blood. You can actually get edema which just means a swelling caused by water and that's because the water that leaves the capillaries doesn't get pulled back in. Okay, and so this causes a certain type of swelling now, I want to say that those kind of protein deficiencies, you might encounter in the clinic or with people who have starved if people have seen her that you're not going to see it it normal people on Western. You know, this is a low protein situation, but that's basically the idea. So the idea is that blood pressure is balanced the normal blood pressure that moves blood through the capillaries is balanced by protein osmotic pressure. And so this is an example of a foot that might be swollen, but that's really pretty and here's an actual picture of one of these swollen feet. So this is someone with an extreme protein deficiency this actually manifesting terrible water balance such as all ends up in the peripheral tissues cuz there's no pulling it back and it's a clinical pictures are extreme cases. Like this must be someone who had a terrible.  Efficient and pregnancy a terrible deficiency in protein, you know to make the example another feature of protein deficiency. That's very clear is the gut can't turn the small intestine can't turn over cells. Remember one of the really beautiful things about the small intestine is in order to deal with the stress of constant in a constant digestive enzymes and acid that's put in and neutralized into the pancreatic fluid and the Damage that happens from Big of digestive organ is it turns in cells over all the time. The intestinal villus dealer cells are constantly being replaced. And so if you have a lack of protein, you can't the cells can't grow they know you need protein to build cell components just like you need membranes and you did nucleotides. You have to constantly be supplying that so it's almost like bad a low protein levels can cause Scott problems. And then the thing about Banos it's a positive feedback loop cuz when you don't have good absorption from the gut, it makes it even harder to get more protein so it can be said about a positive feedback loop.  Okay, so dietary protein can also cause immune deficiency. So it turns out that lack of protein can cause immune incompetence cuz again do you mean cells are rapidly turning over cells or population is growing all the time as they grow they change their information content. Okay. So one of the things about protein deficiencies as you can get much more susceptible to diseases that are fought off by the immune system cells measles can be fatal in populations like children who don't have good protein get to their diet candida growth can occur in the mouth in the throat which normally constantly monitored and then there's some fancy things it turns out that certain low protein States, especially some amino acids can change the balance of inflammation and immune modulation of gut microbes and cause problems that are only now being that he took a lot of different levels all the way from biophysical like osmotic pressure and water balance to immune function and signaling, okay.  So what are the things that are real eyes cuz often in these kind of classes, you'll hear very extreme symptoms and it's good to know about them. Especially if you're going to be Physicians or volunteer workers or Travelers, even or whatever or just an empathetic, you know, whatever is is you hear about the syndrome that you think, you know exactly why to me and the fact is in in our in our neck of the woods protein amount is really not a problem. In fact, we're going to talk later about the other side of that is high protein consumption, but thieves robbed the recommended daily amounts for protein for men or this is beyond completely public house so different size, you know, I mean, I'm more at my size is more, you know for this this kind of is 55 or 45 grams or women and typically many between 95 and 100 grams of protein does an average and women eat about 65 grams of protein a day. So we're most of us are exceeding our protein requirements substantially, you know, this is  Terrible thing but it's it's it's just that there's so much protein rich food available anywhere, you know, like a cheeseburger a hard-boiled egg. This stuff is everywhere. It's like there's food, great food abundance. Okay. So there's also remember these dri's we talked about there's you know, there's the Brightside what you need when everyone needs an innocent Darkside the you know, the the upper limit of this so there can be, you know, too much protein in the diet and people have studied this one of the things you get burdens on the kidneys to excrete excess urea. I'm so especially people with renal problem. Do you know what too much protein are also certain genetic diseases. Where are there certain proteins that can be really dangerous because they're mad metabolites can't be dealt with in one we talked about with fennel keto Yuri. That's a special case. It's more exemplary. But if you have it, it's real and you think about with the kind of person you reading. So the upper limit for men is 140 grams with to get to grams per kilogram of body weight.  And for women to be 115 gram so, you know, even with our overabundant protein is something we're well below the upper limits of normal diet. You don't see protein deficiency. Nor do you see too much? You know, it's so the interesting question and has to be like what what is protein Quality Inn? What is you know, what kind of thing so your protein quality is this idea that as you know, tomorrow's leaders of science molecular biology to the core is it everything's made of proteins and you this 20 amino acids are everything so important question at both in terms of composition and availability and digestibility and other things are come along for the ride. All of those questions is what about protein quality? How do we even evaluate protein quality like one of the best sources of protein and so it'll be best sources depend upon this idea protein quality to measure of how well the protein a given protein supports growth and maintenance of the body. So this is actually something people have measured to think about so  Approaching party is a function of the abundance and ratio essential amino acids in food and how well that protein is ingested digestion assimilated. So another thing we talked about essential fatty acids, and you know what some of those are and there's also essential  amino acids  How do you sensual fatty acids we talked about her these, you know, interesting polyunsaturated fatty acids that we can't make and we take them up from plant or fish sources are plantar benthic sources and then build these really cool polyunsaturated fatty acids like a racket on a casa. Do you have a low concentrations are very important functions? Okay. Well, we can't make either it's a crapshoot. Some organisms can make all of them is one of the amazing things. If you do any sort of microbiology, like work with bacterial or Yeast disease organisms are phenomenally. So all they need is a nitrogen Source like a single molecule of nitrogen a single molecule of oxygen that can include water, you know, a few other elements and they can build an entire replicas of themselves. They really don't need anything. They are very Oxford autotrophic is called the we are Austin Trout's and just like that dinosaur in Jurassic Park that couldn't couldn't make its own licensing and they thought that was going to keep him.  Spreading to San Diego until the second movie is you know, we need certain amino acids. And those are the essential amino acids. So hear the essential amino acids in know you don't have to memorize them. Although I guess it interesting class. It would be appropriate. I'm sure there are nutrition classes are people have to know them but I don't know which one of those things that you know, it's at your fingertips. It doesn't help you think about things and be on the level are we on the level that there are such things now that you know what there's some illness or some sort of syndrome or some sort of situation where an organism demands and amino acid then your has specific stress is it could be born to know that but I think our thing is going to be so these are the essential amino acids here. Okay, and some of them are these Astrid ones are these are the branched chain amino acids and then these are the non-essential once and you'll notice some of them are made from very old friends Alpha ketoglutarate oxaloacetate pyruvate. These are very familiar.  Vacuoles. Remember you can take a ketone and converted to an a mean through this very standard chemistry and biochemistry talked about knees are so every one of these is a cognate Alpha keto acid for amino acid cognate Alpha keto acid amino acid cognate Alpha keto acid amino acid, and we asked you earlier to know these that's really useful to know as biochemist says people who think about biochemistry this a basic idea. So you can see that that essential amino acids in the abbreviation for this is EAA.  I know there's a hell of a lot of acronyms. It sounds like some some government agency the EAA but it's actually essential amino acids essential amino acids are really an important part of protein quality because that's the thing you have to eat. You have no recourse except to consume those diet are early. So one very valuable way to assess protein quality is how much of the essential amino acid content is being met by consumption of that protein. And so there's a couple ways people have done that. This is actually interesting because there's ways that are very optimistic and where is it is very pessimistic and they're both useful for evaluating dietary sources of the things. I've come to realize from talking to people and in teaching this course and everything so many apples or pears in my life as after that dietary fiber. Holy crap. I don't eat any fiber. I'm like it. I'm like a space Joe eater, so I complete  Change that and I'm sure more will happen. But one of the things that we need to think about this is the way we're eating an end and I think a huge problem with medicine in this is a hyperlink. I'm laying a hyperlink on you. But you know, we're all here to learn together is it  You will learn if you go to med school. Even the best message was for you in a bit Stanford Harvard really modern teaching. You will hear very little about things that keep you well, you will learn a lot about how to keep get away from being sick, but you will hear much much less about things that will keep you. Well you're training to be the world's most amazing biological car mechanic as opposed to the very best life coach. And so the whole desire is to move that I was talking to a guy that we're going to teach a class together. He's a physician practicing physician. He loves exercise is a triathlete. He's really interested in the effects of exercise on the body and he wants to like get together and we're going to class we have Med students and biology students together talking about their Separate Peace and questions. And if so how much exercise do we do the med students going to go save one elective class at like six people take where is exercises maybe one of the very best way.  How to avoid needing a doctor interesting places that generate doctors don't teach people how to avoid needing medicine is super important if I have a broken leg. I want to go to The Very Best Western Fix-It doctor there is I don't want any herbs dangled in front of me or pendulums I want so I'm a big fan of the standard fix what's broken medicine but there's a whole interesting element. It's more interesting classes like this one and exercise it or about maintaining Health as opposed to fixing broken. Hell, okay, that's just were thinking about cuz you guys are going to inherit that caduceus. You know that snake snake Okay. So I'm thinking about nutrition, you know is is a very important part of that. It's been known for a long time. So you're really on The Cutting Edge your glass. Okay. So a hyperlink destroyed train of thought for adults about 10.  Percent of total protein intake has to be essential amino acids. That's about that that's enough to meet need. So you're making the ones you can about 10% and 4 amp in this is interesting infants eat about 45% of their total protein intake has to be essential amino acids. Why because they're growing fast. They're going all kinds of tissues turning over to their stomach isn't even fully like whole organs are still being constructed an amazing pace and just like little kids little infants learn super fast. They also are growing Superfast. Okay, so infant seat 45% of total protein is essential amino acids in these are the numbers for it to so there's a number of interesting measures that are very public health. These are all commissioned by the government and you know, we actually have a government that's at least starting in the forties is a very concerned with figuring out what we should eat and studying it which is pretty cool. I mean, you know, it's  Is a neurologist building fighter jet about how to keep people, you know eating healthy and well, okay, so there's a there's a protein deficiency. It supposed to be ratio. I have rayshun but it supposed to be ratio in Racine isn't amusing accidental pain like he was approaching you're getting a ratio. Okay. And so what is a comparison of weight gain in a growing rat after 10 days or more of eating a standard amount of protein with a with a sea of a standard amount of protein and then you test another protein to see which makes a rat grow better assistant bioassay kind of very old school. Okay. And so what they'll often do is compare that protein to to something like the protein efficiency ratio is the weight gain a divided by the number of grams of protein consumed. Okay. So that's just you take an animal you give them store number grams of protein. How much does the animal grow? You know, how big how much heavier is get as it was a very empirical number?  And what you can get from this is you can already just taken your rats and and feeding them a certain number of grams of protein. You can discover that fish is better than milk about a week now has a lot of this is because of certain number of grams of protein in a fish is going to have a lot of other nutrients they're coming along for the ride and this isn't just about the protein. This is about this food sources. Well, it's pretty simple idea though. I didn't kiss you in the mindset of I'm doing these kinds of experiments. Okay. So there's another interesting score of the total amino acids score and what that does is it calculates the ratio of all the essential amino acids in a gram of test protein and compare them to a standard in this case is egg whites or egg whites play really big and a measurement of amino acids in egg white protein cuz their egg whites are almost all protein and yolks are almost all lipids. They're both really great for you. If you eat the right amount to spite the Zhang study, okay, but  You're actually really rich in protein. That's a good comparison. It's just something you know, you can you can compare to easily and so basically it's a it's a score of the milligrams of all essential amino acids per gram to buy the milligrams of all essential amino acid for gram of egg white not notice, you know, eight essential amino acids. So if one's really lacking was really abundance the score is not going to pick that out. You might have a you know about a protein ratio a total protein total amino acids before I mean, it's really high but there could be an amino acid in there that's really missing is just the total sum milligrams is high. So if you're thinking this doesn't sound like the greatest way to judge a food source, you're right. Okay. So let's do an example here in peanut butter delicious peanut butter. Here's egg protein. Okay. So what you do is for each amino acid, you have a separate score you compare the milligrams per gram of histidine.  Isoleucine is of the humidity is essential amino acids here. And so you see some of them are really great and how you getting more histidine per gram of peanut butter than you do in an egg. So, that's awesome. But some of them is very low self-esteem synonyms to combine these to see they're both sulfur containing interconvertible amino acids. You actually do pretty poorly. You're not even getting half as much of this essential amino acid. If you eat peanut butter instead of eggs bummer who wants an egg and jelly sandwich yuck. Okay, so so anyway, this is what we're talkin about. So if you calculate this whole score this a total amino acids score peanut butter has 406 mg of total protein egg whites a program and soda scores about 6. Okay, you know, it's okay, but then the  The another way to do it is to notice and some of these are worse than others. So a total amino acid score is fairly optimistic. It takes the sum total so really lacking ones might be counterbalanced by ones that are superb undent. Okay, so there's another scoring. I don't know why it's named is called the chemical score and I think it's cuz it for change the individual molecules. It's strange to me and I don't understand why are the chemical score basically considers at considers?  The individual amino acids. So the way that I don't have that formulas and chemical score me see if I've got this. You know what I lost a slide in there. I'm sorry to say, but the  Are the total amino acid scores here?  And the okay I have to clarify that don't worry. I won't ask you any exam cuz there's actually a more pessimistic score but I'm missing it here. Okay, so  then there's one other thing that happens is that there's a protein digestibility the protein that just be corrected amino acids for this actually is an acronym p a pdcaas. This is a real number that people measure and so it's the most widely used on on really detailed food labels and what it is is it takes the the the chemical score that's the end of protein availability.  For the scores for the worst amino acid represented. So what the chemicals go does is it takes the the ratio of the lowest represented essential amino acid and Compares it to the to the egg whites. So it's a good description of the worst case in that collection of essential amino acids. And then on top of the so it's a good indication. If something has a high chemical score I get it now filming of the high chemical score. It means is providing. Even when you consider the worst essential amino acid a lot of what you need. Okay, so fish if I'm very high chemical scores where is milk not so good weed out very good at all. Okay, so it complete protein source is is considered complete of its chemical score that is its measure of the worst amino acid ratio to the to the egg reference is pointed 5 or better. So, you know, it's the worst case scenario and it's still pretty good protein digestibility corrected.  I actually just includes a empirically measured quantity called the digestibility. This has to do with how you know how well the amino acid actually in that particular food source gets into the gets in the digestion. You're just like glycemic index berries with you. No different food types amino acid availability can often can vary also. So this is the this is the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score. And so for instance for white flour protein at white flour protein as a pretty low chemical score meaning there's things in there that are very below, you know, the optimal amount of essential amino acid compared to egg and then to digest abilities round .9, so wheat flour protein not so great in terms of an amino acid Source. Okay. So yeah Wendy's nutrition label say they don't tell us, you know, we get a lot of information and proteins in food in one of these that you will notice. This is actually Tempe which is a wonderful source of protein and fiber.  Soy product people figure out all sorts of clever ways to make it seem like meat if you go to Loving Hut vegan place down in off El Cajon. They are amazingly genius it making food taste like things that you should pray that you would crave like cheeseburgers and I don't know what else shrimp but it's all veganized. Okay, but you will see here this room since there is there protein is 22 grams per serving per for on serving. That's really pretty good as high dietary fiber. And so the question is, you know plants have a lot of good protein. What's what should we do? What do we do with plans and and years did I pull backwards? Okay. Yes. So summary of protein quality is based on protein quality animal source is the best when you consider all these different measures of you know, extension amino acids and and digestibility and availability and ratio and comparing foods to a reference source.  Great true that animal services are the best source of dietary amino acids red meat is also a great source of vitamin B12 and iron Gary's a great source of calcium. So you might think you know and then when you compare that if you just take individual plants plants versus they're incomplete off in a single plant is going to be missing some essential amino acid and have a very low chemical score, you know, if it considered so grains and nuts and seeds ordovician. Am I seeing beings are deficient in Messiah name and so one of the tricks is to mix food and we'll talk a little bit about that. But I want to remind you that before we start thinking that need is a Bad Thing these two incredibly powerful and successful animals are both of vegans are there not even occasional carnivores. These are both vegan animal said are incredibly powerful incredibly must get our idea that you can't get a good source of dietary protein from Plants just is wrong. It's not true. So when the things we want to think about in the sack,  It's really interesting as you make your own lifelong food choices to fill out on John's single form tomorrow for the next 30 Years is you know, your food choices at you know, this one of the things that might inform them. Okay, so it's interesting but down so, you know that you would think though if you just looked and amino acid composition and chemical scored availability that meets the way to go. You know, it's available its abundant. It's not super expensive especially if you're okay with things like factory farming which is really important and reasonable thing to think about but it's every conversation of this one but nevertheless it's quite available High caloric density. It tastes delicious at least if your amigon like I am at the opposite of a vegan and so, you know, it's fine. But what about me? So there's a very interesting our body and the government called into the national nutritional monitoring and related research act. That's a an act that decided that every 5 years of us depart.  Is Health and Human Services HHS and the USDA Department of Agriculture must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information or guidelines for the general public. Okay. It's fun thinking we have a president who loves Kentucky Fried Chicken, but they're still doing this is awesome. Okay, and you can argue with success. Maybe we should all be eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. So the statue requires that the dietary guidelines be based on a preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge. So this is a federal statues saying that every 5 years the government needs a commission a major study. I understand what we now know what we've learned in The Last 5 Years about diet, which I think is pretty cool. That makes me happy to be a merkin. You know, that's pretty cool. Every 5 years has that's a pretty small time window for studies. Okay. So this is an example of an interesting one the last one in 2015. So this is pretty recent scientific report of the dietary guidelines advisory committee. I came up with this list of the old  Full body of evidence examined by 2015 they look at lots of studies, you know, these are actual nutritional and scientist biochemist cardiologist. Those kinds of people the overall body of evidence identified that it healthy diet Rebounderz higher and vegetables fruits whole grains is totally depressing to be whole grains low and nonfat dairy Seafood legumes and nuts modern and alcohol lower in red and processed meat and low in sugar and Sweden food. So this is kind of what you might expect that. This is, you know, ewe major body of study and so I want to show you some of the studies that are my but I also want to I want to read some of these questions are asked questions rolling in the people that we all eat. So what are the conditions for the amino acid be both ketogenic and glucogenic if an amino acid has two routes of catabolism.  And one of those routes give you a co-cola that'll be ketogenic. If it gives you pyruvate or something bigger than ends up in the Krebs cycle. That's glucogenic cannot be used to make glucose does bigger products like Alpha ketoglutarate pyruvate succinate can be used to make glucose. It's as simple as that the fact is there's some amino acids that can be metabolized by Branch Pathways. And if one of those get to Cedar Cove way and the other goes something that can be used to make glucose. That's mixed. Okay, it's as simple as that. Okay, and now it's on the podcast. Okay. So good question what happens to excess protein consumed that the body can't use immediately wonderful question there is unfortunately no glycogen for proteins. There's no sort of storage polymer what that store is polymer is your muscle protein. So a lot of amino acids would just get excreted out. If you're not, you know, if your training and such and you have growth signals from the tour pathway and stuff you'll build tissue, but it takes a long time, you know.  And and the rest will just I'll get metabolized in the gut taken up in the blood and broken down. That's why you eating a lot of protein can be a burden on the kidney cuz there's a constant turnover of these things is unfortunately no storage polymer for amino acids probably goes in the time of a revolution. We didn't have exposure to lots of those things and they were rare to what extent does exercise increase protein upper limit. I mean, you know, we can be pretty substantial. It depends on the kind of exercise to if you are a doing endurance exercises very different from lifting bodybuilding. We're actually building tissue, but it's also important to realize as we learned in 108 that the first like 12 weeks of a bodybuilding or a resistance exercise training is almost all the neural and you're not building tissue you're changing connections to improve outweigh efficiency and movement of of muscle. So it takes a while you want to get big start lifting but keep the ducting.  Okay, let's see. Can you go over chemical score again? How's it going at it chemical score is a you take the milligrams of the least abundant essential amino acid compared that to the milligrams in the stores that ratio is the chemical score. It's the worst case scenario the other score the total amino acids score with you add up all of them and out of all of the amino acids and take that ratio. So it masks the really not abundant ones if they're really abundant ones along in that song. Okay. Alright, but I'm glad you're doing this. So these dietary guidelines included a number of different studies in these are pretty amazing. So, you know, I kind of what kind of is one of the things about nutritional science because we all eat and we're all intrigued by eating only think about it multiple times a day is that studies like this get out into the sort of PODS fear into the air into the atmosphere into the broscience kind of stuff. You know, we all started Noah  Got it, you know until the question is, you know to what extent is history. So this actually want to be viewed as longitudinal studies. This is a pretty famous when called the Chicago Western Electric study and it is a Elijah Joseph longitudinal study in which state study for seven years with a prospective say they chose a group of people at a company on Western Electric had lots and lots of plays their cohort was white males just to keep things a little more uniform with its own set of problems and they looked at 1730 employed people between the ages of 40 and 55 years of the study to ask about what would be the effects of eating a protein Source. Okay. This is a little complicated. But basically what they found is if you took people who ate more plant proteins and you compare them to people await more meat protein there was definitely not only a correlation. Is there more protein to went up the more there risk for obesity went up but also,  We are the hazard ratios. This is the overall risk of obesity became substantially higher with a very height. Is there a significant with people who ate mostly plant in taking there's this is complicated cuz you don't just eat pure plants you eat a lot of different things in those plants. And also your total amount of protein is difference of this study is exactly one graph from a very elaborate analysis what they found this is plant protein went up the risk for obesity actually dropped as animal protein went up the risk for obesity increased so pretty intriguing of course, what's the problem is that this amount hear of of kilocalories per cent kilocalories is lower than the highest when you're so there could be some kind of a sweet spot that you just can't attain with plant protein. I think that's interesting. But it look like these are people eating normal diet. They weren't Upon a Time restricted. They basically followed with these people didn't divided them into groups to get an understanding of that. So, it's quite clear that lease.  This particular fairly large group of people in a sort of middle age range that eating a lots of plant protein with bad in a correlated with bad obesity outcomes. Okay. So there's another huge that eat a diet high in I mean make sure I got that right diets high in red meat especially process red result in the higher risk of type 2 diabetes is another very large study for each additional serving per day increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by 12% and process red meat by 32% So 30% of the wrist tattoo. It means the risk increased eye when you normalize it by 32% per extra helping, you know, so eating other people who eat red meat multiple times a day and a day as a group have a much higher risk of type 2 diabetes is mean they're all going to get it and they're definitely people who can join that metal or 80 years old.  I'm fine if they exist. So this is one of the Troubles of parsing out from public health observation detailed individual cases. So conversely what reduces risk least that is a van into his nuts low fat. Dairy products are whole grains Okay, so there's actually, you know, then that this sort of the the Big Mamou or these days where they just look at all immortality that's been normalized to get rid of things like being struck by lightning in car accidents and stuff like that that you know don't really play a part in understanding the public health aspects of it. But this is a study with over half a million people. They took a whole bunch of cohorts and you have collected the data. I'm for 10 years. And again, in this case. They got a 30% increase risk of death from heart attack and cancer When comparing people to wait most red meat that's 5 ounces per day for 2005 Quarter Pounder is 4 oz of meat. Do you know that and that's considered like a lot of people get more than that when they go out to eat so a quarter  Pound burger a 4oz steak is not a lap. Some people eat meat everyday. This is not a huge amount, you know versus the lease is .06 and so hardly any meat at all interesting lie in this study, which is a pretty well-known study women were at a higher risk. So women who ate red meat for reasons that aren't yet clear. She didn't even hire increase risk of of type 2 of overall mortality. It's not clear why I'm so I'm going to let you go 5 minutes early the questions we've taken care of and so I will see you on Thursday. "
