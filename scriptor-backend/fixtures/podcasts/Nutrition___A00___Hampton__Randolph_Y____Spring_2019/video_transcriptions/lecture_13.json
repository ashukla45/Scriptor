    "Full Transcript": "All right.  Okay.  All right.  Happy Tuesday.  you're really something I've been reading a bit about nutrition as you might expect and  I thought of something really amazing really interesting.  Not if if you get nothing else from this class and I presume you will get a lot more than that. Just what I'm going to say is you understand that there are many many circumstances. We're changing the diet has drastic effects on hell.  For Better or Worse depending on what the change it did they are diets that clearly affect how sometimes Gravely and then their dietary changes that affect how very positive and they're sometimes very detailed and understood in terms of epidemiology that this change causes this alteration but you're so amazing things that you would think that this is something that positions that help professionals that osteopaths that Physicians assistants that nurses would know about the incredible thing is I just I didn't realize is I just found this out is it if you go to med school as many of you want to and we'll do the chances are high that this will be the only nutrition class you have before you become a doctor.  To me that's incredible. That is not just incredible. It is deeply problematic and then there's another part of this that's that's really I think very interesting I was talking to a colleague of mine is a very well-known scientist fantastic scientist. And I said, I'm reading this book about nutritional epidemiology nutritional science. He does is that even a thing is that even exist and he actually believed it and I know what he meant is because for him for this individual unless you have a molecular mechanism, where are Vines to be in causes this thing that happened that then causes this process to occur. It's not science. That's this person's impression and I totally get that cuz I am a very big fan of reductionist mechanistic molecular science. However, it's not the only kind of science there is and a lot of the epidemiology we're learning about is generating scientific.  Play demonstrated questions instead of answers know a lot of students at a lot of scientists. Don't like questions when you're having a discussion scientist like questions because they're there how they make a living. You need the questions to develop ways to test them and answer them. But what you're learning here is a set of really really interesting correlates and questions are ways to question those questions that will make you better and revolutionary Health practitioners. You are literally on the the The Cutting Edge the arrow the spear tip of a revolution in Madison that is about staying well as opposed to getting fixed. It's a huge deal and what we're going to learn a little bit more I want I hope you learn more to a larger extent after you get out of this class. Is it there are many forces. I don't think it's a conspiracy rather than just a set of a line forces towards prophet in the food.  Pain towards time convenience towards poor calorie offerings at very low price that are drastically affecting the health not only of this country. But if this were and it's really an important thing to understand and to be a practitioner and a and a an observer and a crypt and a n a a critical analyzer of and that's why I'm hoping this is step one in that case. So what you're doing here despite the fact that you might be yawning is super important. You're going to know more about nutrition just from this simple basic class the 99% of the Physicians that you walk through medical school with or that you work with after you get out of this class and you'll see it will cause a drastic differences in the way you think about medicine and also maybe it will cause some consternation as you see the way Medical Practice occurs. It's mostly about drugs is mostly about fixing things that are broken.  You know, I'm a big fan of getting fixed when I'm broken. I'm not against that but that's one piece of a multi piece puzzle. Okay enough preaching. I'm done appreciated that before I was not aware. They said I'm reading an absolutely amazing book that I will tell you about on Thursday. You can you can listen to the audiobook while you're running you can go to the Ted yogurt ears the trick. I have a trick for you who don't like to read if an author writes a book. They've definitely done a TED Talk they've definitely done it podcast and you can usually get the X distilled extraction points from there. I still think you should read the book but that is a trick that is usually not that you'd ever use it in my class, but it's very useful so we can exchange not told you that the that I'm a big I'm a big proponent of of safe regrading is this a safe space for regrading right? Okay. I don't want you to think that we  Do that thing where professors go if we will give us your chest. We're going to go back through it. Fine. Everything's wrong that we failed to fight before cuz we're not very professional or thorough. I don't do that. I think we're pretty professional tarot. But sometimes we get things wrong and you have the right to argue for what you want. In fact, I'd say it's even part of the learning process cuz we don't have a lock on the way we interpret of you think so. So here's how you do it first. You got to get your test Step Zero is it has to be written in pen. We don't take a pencil regrade. Okay. I think that's fair and I made a point of that look up the key on Triton Ed. We have the key there and I actually put every point value in that is Asian teams have been super useful in this way and instead of organizing it on a separate sheet of paper. You going to do a little work, right your justification for a re-grade you can include multiple items in one page. I know your page for every item if it's in addition are it's just help with a for me to do it all at the same time.  Just a simple addition are still submitted regrade cuz it otherwise it's just a big a big mess. Okay, you have till Thursday to do this.  This coming Thursday. I'm going to put a box right here for your testing in a box. I'm going to put a box right here and during the class or after the class. You put those regrets in the box and you will ruin my weekend, but that's okay, you know, it's a small price to pay for being fair and considering your needs. Okay, but it is absolutely a deadline is the end of class Thursday is it I'm not taking any others cuz I get many of them and I'm perfectly happy to do it. But I think it's fair that I create a window of time that you jump through. It shows your commitment. Okay, and I promise you I will do none of that stuff before I go. I will this was wrong, you know, I won't do that. That's just not cool. I have a thing tomorrow.  I got a thing I have to do is send involving his training Grant with grad students that I'm involved with this wonderful thing to do, but it is going to eat my Wednesday afternoon. So I'm going to have office hours today. If some of you want to come to office hours, it's always a lot of fun. We have a lot of lively discussions is going to be today from 4 to 5. Normally. It's on Tuesday from 3 to 4. I mean New Orleans on Wednesday from 3 to 4. It's today Tuesday 4 to 5 same place 2130 pack Hall. So if you want to come be awesome to see you.  Bring food. Okay, we're doing our bullet experiment text question again, I guess they iPad wasn't working. But now it seems to be working. I got this test transmission so ask away.  Right. Now there was an interesting question that came up. There was actually another interesting if I should have came up in the classroom in a convert into one of the discussion topics. It was about this study. We talked about with beta-carotene and what not. But this is a question that came up and this is particularly challenging is that I've asked the same. So we're talking about alcoholic flush that when if you can't metabolize alcohol from the aldehyde form 2B acetic acid from quickly with a buildup of acetaldehyde and certain Asian populations in Middle Eastern populations have a certain allele of this aldehyde dehydrogenase. This aldehyde reductase that tends to cause aldehydes the build-up is also a drug called ice off from that blocks. It ends. I'm completely it's used to keep people from drinking cuz that aldehyde makes him so sick and that's caused by histamine. And someone asks is Pepcid, which is a H2 antagonist of histamine type 2 receptor antagonist block to Flushing. And I said, yes it does.  And then they wrote Ask the same question about Pepcid before to my pharmacology Professor. He said Pepsi couldn't really help with flush that much because of flesh is caused by histamine actor in H1 receptor, but Pepcid Works, NH to receptor switch on receptor helps better. You know what this is Professor cage match. Somebody's trying to lay down the rock. I can't not rise to that. You know, it's like the clegane's is like simile mrs. Side silvina, since I don't want to spoil that, you know what happened, but assuming this is side. That's a good question because often H2 receptors are thought about acid reflux and start looking into it and is actually a paper as many papers on this now. I'm sorry about this unwoke title. This is about 20 years ago. So now people say Asian populations is Orion was a characteristic.  Where is Asian is a geographical place? But we understand that we're all learning gradually as these things merge, and we're not going to excoriate these people for using the word of the day 20 years ago. Okay, but anyway, they have histamine receptor antagonist of an Thomas alcohol in the Asian population. And so they did actually test a group of Seventeen subjects who had this thing each subject received Placebo diphenhydramine, which is an H1 antagonist inside Betadine, which is a H2 receptor antagonist alive Pepcid a singly and in combination to get an alcohol is an awesome awesome great except for the flushing. So the flesh temperature they did flush temperature in systolic hypertension with significantly blocked by the combined antihistamine immiseration cimetidine alone block the flesh. That's the H2 antagonist.  Significantly more than diphenhydramine, but less than the combined diphenhydramine was similar to Placebo. So age to good h111 nothing the pair the best so there's some kind of complex energy. So in a way, it's wrong itch this professor was wrong ish H2 blockers. Definitely help H ones alone. Do not help. The combination is the best so in a way we're both right cagematch neutral but H2 receptor antagonist in his clearly away so much so that I found other papers for health professionals were warning the Asian people some time to use antihistamines to be able to drink more and they were worried about college students sick. So cuz if you flush less you'll drink more I say, I don't know in a dark bar who cares whatever. I'm okay. We were talking about vitamins.  And I wanted to continue on our discussion this weird thing about fat-soluble vitamins and then we're going to talk about Waterside but ones and they're very different and really interesting thing and out. Somebody ass. I just asked me about the so this is divided mini classic ultra coveralls and you will notice there's four different structures here all these different to call Faraz in it soon came up and said how do we know the difference between all these slightly relays simulator related structures and it turns out there's a term to describe this. You know, how an isomer is a rearrangement of atoms and structure and an enantiomer is a different spatial version of the same a mirror image of a molecule. There's a weird vitamin has the vitamins. This is a collection of related molecules that are all considered the same vitamin activity and it's really sort of a biological distinction because vitamins can these molecules can be interconverted each other. So very good example in the student to ask me is Retin-A now,  retinol  and retinoic acid that's weird are it's hidden oack acid. These are all considered vitamin-a versions and that's why in the blood they measure a retinoic acid equivalent is because you just sum up all the different molecules cuz they are interconverted so easily this is a soda and the tocopheryl there another person actually eight different I have four of them. Here are very closely related structures that all can be used as that vitamin in the body and it's kind of neat as I want you to look at these These are these have this nice structure. Okay. This is their hydrophobic. They have a long water cause isoprene tails made from the cholesterol pathway and these molecules are basically antioxidants. So unlike some of our Litem is it has very specific biological activities that bind to a receptor like vitamin D binds to a receptor and causes a program of gene expression and vitamin A.  Retinol does that beautiful thing with the rhodopsin molecule and then retinol also retinoic acid also bind to receptor and causes a program of gene expression. These molecules eat vitamin D different. They're basically antioxidants now, I know you've heard the term antioxidant before  Very by. It is something you will have heard.  All over the place. I'm sure you have friends or you yourself were taking various antioxidant to hear it mentioned constantly and antioxidants actually have a bona fide a real of legit biochemical a place and buy a place in Biochemistry and that is because oxygen which we can't live without help with her oxygen is actually a pretty feisty molecule and it reacts with a lot of things oxygen loves to get reduced. It loves to oxidize things by getting reduce. It loves to grab electrons that thing is hungry for electron and so between a pure oxygen and completely reduce oxygen are all sorts of intermediates that are called reactive oxygen species or Ross r o s. So reactive oxygen species is a term a popular term. You'll see This Acronym all over the place. And the funny thing is you'll also see you don't want in this Earth You know the Broan Alice is that you he  About in people talk about Wellness, you know, it started like I'm taking some antioxidants in my lifting better, you know, it's tough and a lot of athletes, you know experiment with antioxidants to try to decrease stress on the body and all the stuff. And so this actually a pretty elaborate chemistry of reactive oxygen species are here. This is just a few of them. This is called Sue peroxide peroxide you've heard about this is a this is water not one of them is the oxyanion the oxide ion. This is a bunch of them and most of them are generated by the mitochondria not doing quite what it supposed to do. So when a mitochondrion is cranking away in a moving electrons down the beautiful complex electron transport chain, you were many many different molecular centers are grabbing those electrons and moving them in a little bit of Delta G is generated pushing a little bit of hydrogen across the inner membrane occasionally and electron will bounce out and hit an oxygen and form of a superoxide.  Ocular something like that knows her very reactive this other ways that happened metal ions that are reactive. You know, remember metals have those are all those cool of D orbitals. I can grab different numbers of electrons. So a lot of metals including Ironton Forum, very nasty reactive oxygen species, like iron is very important in forming is hydroxyl radical that is a very very reactive molecule and these reactive oxygen species can damage all sorts of biomolecules that can damage proteins that can damage DNA they can damage membranes. They can also cause chain reactions were the free radical in a free radical can grab something from another free radicals and grab another from another free radical and you can have these is chain reactions were radicals passed through many different molecules and you can be quite reactive. So antioxidants a very large glass of different molecules some of which are vitamins and some of which are not that can deal with a neutralizes free radicals Often by blocking a chain reaction.  Sequestering an actin molecule like a like a metal ion. So there's a number of different mechanisms and it turns out that a reactive oxygen species are produced by respiration environmental toxins in the immune system's the immune system actually uses reactive oxygen species to do thing on so this is a small number of examples is singlet oxygen a peroxide radical superoxide anion hydroxyl radical specifically toxic important thing in this is actually a very exciting field of cellular biology is it it's now clear that reactive oxygen species have a place in normal biology. They're not just all bad and they're using signaling their used by immune cells to to kill and modify pathogens are there's probably a sweet spot and reactive oxygen species around it are an important part of how is cell does what it does. This isn't that shocking is that mitochondria and has been part of a eukaryotic experience for like over a billion years and if they're constantly generating is reactive oxygen species. Just no way that evolution.  We're going to figure out a way to capitalize on that in a number of different ways. So the new thing is that the vitamins we take like vitamin E probably just keep that in check and allow you to have a certain amount of free radicals in and other reactive oxygen species that are good. So that's the way to look at it. So this is actually an example of how reactive oxygen species are useful is when you get an injury like a pinprick here. Are you guys at the end and you get a little micro infection, you know, the bacteria start producing chemicals that attract phagocytes. So what are the cool things is there are signals that bacteria make just by the course of their metabolism that actually attract white blood cells and white blood cells actually stay over. There are literally moving along the a blood vessel when they stop when they sent these things and and they literally adhere to the end of the illegal cell into the tissue to it. Like they're like police that stop when they see something funny off of Highway and go into that field where people are doing their Shenanigans and and what happens he's phagocyte.  Are attracted the government and they actually use a very elaborate enzymology to generate up free radicals and end very nasty. They generate chloride that's like bleach hypochlorite that generate superoxide degenerate hydroxy radical to generate a lot of different molecules by account. They said they have also out of these molecules in your membranes and in your cells is good at keeping membrane and other macromolecular Integrity together in the face of continuous production of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria from environmental toxins from other molecules from not metal ions that are that are doing their chemistry. So it's really kind of a beautiful thing. Okay. Here's the thing though and this is probably why this is one way to start thinking about this holistic approach is that you might think well, what I should do is just take vitamin E just take crap loads of vitamin E and protect myself from all these nasty.  Oxidative damage, which is clearly correlated with lots of different aging functions. So one of the things people have done many years ago is shown that in aging animals and an aging people that protein damage tends to accumulate in cells in different tissues as aging occurs and it's just a it's a thing that happens if I'm getting a phone call here, but I'm just going to be okay. And so one of the things that's important really about the biology and reactive oxygen is there are many many many participants in the oxidative damage thing. So this is actually a little I keep pressing the home button. This is actually a little sort of summary sheet of the different kinds of ways that we deal with oxidative damage. So there's there's a number of enzymes. Okay, so there enzymes that actually reverse oxidative damage through catalytic process is vitamin E. There's a carotenoids, which I remember the crime has had that beautiful pie system of electrons, very good at reacting with things are free radicals others bilirubin, Urich.  Acid ubiquinone which is the mitochondrial inner electron Francis lipoic acid metal binding proteins. This is a very important enzyme called superoxide dismutase. So there's both ends Ematic and straight chemical approaches add this meaning it's really sort of a conglomerate a conspiracy a collection of different molecules that all work together. This is you know, a group of molecules have been shaped, you know, 4 billion years or three and a half billion years of evolution to work together. So throwing 1 in G oxygen in the mix is Ed best neutral maybe even help but it worst as we will see and talk about discussion can be even problematic. So maybe that's one way to look at it since it's actually a collection of different ones is another way to look at it. There's enzymes fat-soluble antioxidant like typical Pharrell's at Vitamin D. The carotenoids a vitamin A type of molecules and then water soluble antioxidants will talk about vitamin C vitamin C has a a speckled history and a clear  Importance in an indirect entomology as a cofactor, but it also has very good antioxidant properties in and figuring out what those are is not clear yet. But so these are actually three enzymes that are really important superoxide dismutase. Does this reaction actually s o d that's what it's called superoxide dismutase is incredibly fast and Zayn, I think it's it's turn over numbers like 2 million a second. So it's incredibly active and important into I'm sorry and catalase is another important you'll notice it's taking all these nasty molecules and turning them into friendly or friendlier ones is this is still nasty, but it's out of nasty to peroxide and peroxidase. So these guys work together in cells to to get rid of a reactive oxygen species. So it's a combination of enzymes as well as he's vitamins nutrition.  So I will end actually Nigel have left out in vitamin K and actually sent him a text cuz he's heard of my McGrew and I said, why did you leave at Litem in cake I saw there's so many other vitamins without Vitamin K is real interesting and very important in medicine. So I'm going to add it back in vitamin K is one of the vitamin systems where you will administer drugs to people if your position and you will experience drugs that block this path path of aspects of the vitamin K function. If you have loved ones who get old because many many people take you so Vitamin K is a family of compounds of settling by timmers like that to such a great word. I've never heard of it in this class.  And I won't make you know what it like I invited her but it's just a useful word inside collection of molecules that together is considered a vitamin infusion cuz you look at this new which one is it, you know, so it's a family of compounds known as vitamin k r Quinn owns including Fila quintones from plants with white screen and menaquinone Supply sort of meet color found in fish oils in meets Mequon tons are also synthesized by bacteria in the human colon. So there's a number of sources of these things and remember our old friend Q10 from the mitochondria mosquitoes around the inner surface of the mitochondrion picking up electrons and bucketing them over to complex-3 right from complexes one into your like I've never thought I'd need to know that again.  Damn, that's just a reference. So here's a family of vitamin K like molecules uses their vitamins are vitamin K. This is Philo quinone. This is Philo pronounce. Epoch side is a little peroxide to oxygen with a pie system between them just like cute, right and he's a he's actually a very good at committing acts of chemistry and be at chemistry that they do is very direct. I'll show you in a minute. So there's number of sources and and whatever I want things I've discovered is a tail in green leafy green vegetable kale is like the champion of nutrition. It's like we all have to start a T Bar cattle and I'm no one's more depressed about this than I am, but it's not really that bad in as many good with gray carotenoids in vitamin K and just great stuff.  Come from hell, you might think that's actually a good demonic is Vitamin K out. It doesn't cover their comes from a Dutch physician who is studying coagulation and it turns out that vitamin K is super important in various aspects of blood coagulation, but they start with a k cuz they're all Euro in such. Okay. So that's where in vitamin K come from its involved in coagulation. You can it says here on daily salad get any dark green vegetables provide to undent vitamin K. If you don't need to you know, there's a number of ways to get it including a ride is supplements, but what's interesting about Vitamin K is its involved in a number of different enzyme activities that prepare the coagulation system to operate and what it basically does is it it causes the are Vitamin K is important in producing gamma.  gamma  What is the right way to phrase this is called?  It's glutamate.  gamma carboxylation  I'll be one way to like put it so there's a bunch of enzymes it take the glutamate residue on proteins and add another carboxyl group to it. So is interesting cuz it's an example of a carboxylate if it does not require biotin, which is almost like her radical, you know, if you learn nothing else in 102 user in the kitchens involving carboxylation, and that's true for small molecules, but not for pro protein. And so there's a number of different steps were Vitamin K is involved in creating a gamma gamma carboxy glutamate. Okay. So guess that's another way to put is gamma carboxy.  Glutamate it's also has this funny named sogou glutamine glutamate is that you know, they let me know acid and it produces with gold. Okay, and so what it looks like is actually pretty simple. So this is a glutamic acid, you know, that's the acidic amino acid residue on a protein soap reducing glutamate and these are gamma waves Karbach the gamma glutamyl carboxylase is using vitamin K as a cofactor in one of the electron donors. So their fancy enzyme add another carboxyl group and what these do. It's actually very simple as if he's this pair of carboxyl groups right next to each other are really good binders of calcium and they allow these things to stick to membranes and perform coagulation event. So so this gamma glutamyl boot animation is super important for coagulation to the point that if you don't have those reactions, you have terribly bad blood coagulation.  And it can even cause lethal type.  oh my God, I'm losing the  The disease where you can't clot blood haemophilia. Thank you. It's time for me to retire and I am my name is equiangular system in one of the protein is not one of these in time is kind of why it's interesting is you see this reaction hear. This is Vitamin K and it's reduced form in this is it to Park City Ice forum and that's how each time you're reacting just like a lot of co-factors it donates some chemistry and then it has to be regenerated and that regeneration process involves a collection of Ensign and those enzymes are actually the targets of a very popular inhibitor. And that inhibitor is called Warfarin or Coumadin. Okay, and Coumadin is a very popular anticoagulant. So what ends up happening is every time the vitamin K gamma gamma carboxylation reaction occurs in this is a number of different proteins in the coagulation in the protein in the blood clot in calf.  It happened and everyone of them is about to glutamate becoming one of these glasses. Okay. So those are the end of the proteins involved in in in coagulation have to be modified that way for them to work correctly. Every time that happens if vitamin K app oxygen read it has to be restored by a pair of enzymes and we're not going to go into the details of this enzyme just enzymology is very well worked out in a lot of people study it but do they drug coumarin which is originally called Warfarin, which is a rat poison. Also cuz rats really are sensitive to this much more than we are and I'll see you give them a lot is involved in regenerating this molecule to keep this reaction only so amazingly if you give someone this drug Coumadin, they actually become much worse at at at blood clotting and they actually become very sensitive to wounds. I'll bleed a lot almost like a hemophiliac not quite that bad and see if I think why would you ever want to give this nasty stuff to patients? It's because many surgical procedures, which I do.  If ice is placed inside a person prone to cause blood clotting many times a stint, you know, one of those if you eat too much fatty meats and trans fats and saturated fats are too long. You may find your coronary arteries clogged and they want to plug it with what's called a stent. And when they do that they give these blood thinners also, they're called blood thinners, which is you know, what a popular term and what's amazing is there now, it's important enough for people know about the that people will wear a bracelet with coumadin on it to indicate to others is fake. If you get in a car accident and your on these drugs and many people are many people in my bracket are because they often have cardiac problems that require some kind of surgical intervention you want to know that if you are a physician or an EMT or some kind of Health maintenance professional because they're proneness to bleed especially with an internal injury that goes undetected can be very bad. So this is a direct function of vitamin K and vitamin K. So it's a medically useful vitamin K deficiency.  Would be one way to look at it. Okay. Now we will switch gears to the water soluble vitamins are so few questions rolling in our Biotin and collagen found in Foods. Yep. And are they necessary? No diet biotin is it one is one of the nutrients collagen not so much cuz you can synthesize it. I would talk to him shampoo and that's probably completely just to sound good. Can you explain what happens to the celiac disease mechanism for a normal healthy normal people say it's just it's it's an autoimmune mechanism. So it's it's a Miss Apple Miss direction of the cell so that the the sensitivity to gluten celiac disease is a missed triggering of the immune cells with these particular peptides know whether it happens to a low-level normal people is an interesting question and it's not well known yet, you know, whether gluten sensitivities of spectrum or is this something totally different that was the subject of your discussion?  Retinal retinal and retinoic acid they have retinoid as what they meant retinoic acid are all vitamin A do they serve the same function in topical skin care is one form better. The impression I have is it retinoic acid is what's used in skincare the is that right? It's written or is it right now? It's it's one of the forms that but it's actually because that form gets into the skin cells and causes his program of gene expression to to alter skin properties and I'm not a physician. This is my guess on that but that form the different forms are better for delivering two different tissue targets and also they have different shelf fights to okay now, we're in check about water soluble vitamins and we'd actually this is spread out over to lectures in the in the original course, and we've already talked to some extent about me some water cycle volume says, he's enzyme co-factors coming over this review it and we'll go a little deeper into some very interesting medicine that goes into these but we're going to cover 6 B vitamins  Vitamin C at the end. We're going to talk some general principles B vitamins are converted into co-factors and substrate. So a lot of these things like we talked about are co-factors there. They're frequently do substrates in many enzymatic reactions. Like you learned about a 102 we talked about in 108 also, they rapidly turn down from the body there excreted in the urine often but not always they don't have an upper limit of consumption but some do and it's important to know those I've been asking him in terms of recommending people's food. This is they usually excreted in the urine and small storage close the exception of B12, which is stored in the liver. So the B12 is in accepting toxicity is low access is filtered by from Blood by the kidneys and there's this joke that people to take lots of vitamin supplements or just creating really expensive urine. I don't think it's quite that simple, but you hear that out in the pods fear or whatever and so the end there's a progression of deficiency that happens as the afternoon and efficient diet. You start  Feeding the storage pools or fat soluble. This can take years or water soluble usually takes weeks or months. So the classic example is the British Sailors who went out on these ships for months and after a couple months, I started suffering from vitamin C deficiency because no one knew that you had to eat those kinds of fruits and we'll talk more about that. I'm in and you have clinical symptoms between that's a 1 in 8 weeks is not not not a hard-and-fast rule. So we'll talk about a few of these and a lot of these are co-factors. We've already discussed and you learned about them in class you learned about them here the place is so, you know, I consider this part of the cantilever process of repetition teaching people in a way that sticks. So this is thiamine. So if I am in so I will show the vitamin and then when it's part of a bigger structure, I will show that to say this is thiamine vitamin B1 in this is our old friend thiamine pyrophosphate and TPP is an incredibly important cofactor and find a place you best remember  is a is in a  Is in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex word attacks pyruvates carbonnieux. They get rid of the CO2 and start moving at acetyl group into acetylcholine. You knowing and so this is what a TPP looks like this is the actor for me. This is what's you so we consume this or things like this and make this and it's a frequently cofactor. So it's primarily involved in decarboxylation Carbondale Activation. So the deal with CPP is that when you have a carbonyl group is a carbonyl group.  what do a real organic style or what is you can get a  herb and I had to attack this right and form this kind of an intermediate in that can that make these bonds labile, you know, this is old-school organic chemistry and she is in the business of producing one of these a carbon ions. Just the right place to do this. So that's how DPP Works into not surprised. There's a lot of reactions that use that particular chemical mechanism. So this is actually a little picture of it and it turns out like a lot of these are all switch the spotlight in the world very sick guy there for a second. I switch the spotlight mode.  If I can figure it out now.  Okay.  Darn, I am just really I am not getting us together I speaking with press it really long.  When we have people who are waiting.  All right. I can't make little Annoying Spotlight appear. Are we go dddddddd? Okay after all that work and this is where the chemistry happens to a lot of these helped factors provide some weird chemical group that you don't see a normal amino acids that is remarkably important doing chemistry. Now where these things came from and how they evolve is a very interesting question. It's not so obvious at this stage. But so did TPP you get basically a holder a cartridge that holds this thing. And in fact, you see the little arrow in the middle of this is the carbon it does all the work is this carbon because of having these very electrophilic things in his bond structure around it is very good at releasing a proton to make a car battery dying. So that particular car brand ion, there is the business end of TPP and it attacks carbonyls. That's what it does. Okay, so I think that is  Okay, I got the. Back. I think that's you know that or at least you knew it and you can dredge it back up. There's a footprint shaped like TPP in your memory circuits and you will fill it with a shoe that looks like TPP maybe that's the best way to put it and so this is actually one of the original classic vitamin deficiencies and and Casimir Funk himself was one of the people who figured out that this was a vitamin deficiency. The guy we talked about last lecture sold in pairs not surprisingly a reaction like this that's involved in pyruvate being converted into a Krebs cycle intermediates and lots of other a carbonyl activating reactions has a lot of functions like the important in nearly every cell in your body. And then these TPB has lots of other functions to so not surprisingly a deficiency in vitamin B1 has many devastating problem. So it is easier called beriberi in this is a poor suffer very berry who is unable.  Walk unassisted is emaciated. It involves problems with the CNS the GI tract muscle and appears in just one or two weeks in a real deficiency syndrome. So this is something that happens pretty quick TPP or that thiamine washes out very quickly and found in cultures, especially underfunded for cultures. Where are refined grains provide most of the calories cuz cuz you were fine grains are in a great source of of vitamin B1. So the RDA one of the things about these vitamins, which is comforting is it doesn't take a lot. So they the recommended daily allotment has one or two m m mm of a Grannis not a lot of these things and there is really no upper limit some of these Benz and just have no other men most people, you know, just from normal eating not taking vitamins. Can you get their amount orb of what they think what they need bees away so we don't see a lot of this. Okay, there's some interesting variations of this so it turns out that alcohol  Inhibits the absorption of vitamin B1 from the gut enough so that alcoholics can show a separate syndrome along with the problems of being an alcoholic especially a late-stage alcoholic. Like I got the hepatic steatosis and the other things we talked about in the bias towards fat synthesis that happens in the liver. They also can show a thiamine deficiency caused by drinking. Okay, so it's actually called the wernicke-korsakoff syndrome. And so was there you know alcoholics will have an additional a staggering gait. I trouble and even C&S derangement now you make the most of that sounds like you're speaking alcoholic, but but there's a although there is a signal to noise ratio. This is a real problem because they have a an actual vitamin B. If it is sort of an alcoholic version of very berry gets on top of the other problems. They haven't and one of the problems with this if you're a clinician is you have someone who's really ill from a primary cause there can be a secondary cause it is something like nutritional  This worth knowing about I think it's kind of amazing that we know that like to me one of the amazing things about medical scientist how much we know like that would not have been an easy thing to figure out so it's a nice to guys. I guess we're two people figured it out. Some vitamin B2 is riboflavin in these are all our old friends fadf. And then you remember all of these things actually plays a role in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to in and I it plays a role in in complex to remember that if he needs the last place with electrons go if you're near talking about the Krebs cycle. So this is what f with this is what riboflavin looks like. This is what we take oreo variations of it by tomorrow 7 and this is the act of molecule and again you see here is the business and down here and it's even better than that. Is this carbons? Remember? This is also something that accepts electrons but usually accepts to eight. You remember those reactions like in fatty acid oxidation?  Can you pull those electrons to make a double bond or in what? What is the other one section 8 dehydrogenase to make male just to refresh your memory. Remember you make a double bond not yelling. I'm just thinking about sex anything hydrogenase yesterday. And so this is your one of these co-factors is actually a pair of them f m n and f a d they're very similar one has a phosphate on at the other doesn't end there, you know involved in a bunch of redox reactions. So they like dehydrogenase reactions in the Krebs cycle beta oxidation is no upper limit to the city. You can take as much as you can afford go to Whole Foods go crazy in home by all the vitamin B2 you want but you only need a couple milligrams a day. Okay. So this is another one of thinking and the deficiencies cause actual number of inflammation reaction, especially in the mouth in the tongue and a certain day Nunez. I'm this is a picture of a bus cytus tongues is an inflamed tongue.  Because tongues are always red. But I guess the inflammation is down around here and maybe it's swollen a bit and not good. So it takes a couple of months for that to happen. All right, that's a vitamin B3 zooming through these cuz we've been over these in this actress in pretty interesting stuff near the end of this so vitamin B3 is niacin and remember nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD nicotinamide niacin. Those are the same kind of words and it turns out there's two different version of this nicotinamide and ice and these are both considered a vitamin A. I mean vitamin B3, you know, usually you have one of the other this is neutral. This is an amide and this is the acid and again the business and is actually right here like so mushy like I figured it out finally. So this is the business end here, you know in 10 like this I can say in his old hat. And if you remember from from 102 or or other classes you may have had this particular.  Carmen is very good at accepting hydride. So this is the oxidized form and that's the reduced form with this extra H - so you can have two electrons Plus in H+. You can have an H minus and an HP the number Wizards versus I always like to look at it. So I dried + H - being added to it cuz it's easy to picture the stereochemistry doesn't matter. We're not going to go deep into the weeds of mechanism in this class. But this is basically the business and its attached to like many of them attached to a nucleotide and you know, that's the way this is an electron acceptor electron donor. And the the this is the chemistry read a little larger and like I said you probably remember this is attached to the rest of it. And you have this is the electron for its electron emission this can I donate electrons in h - to do a reductionist can take them to do an oxidation unless I say there's these reactions are everywhere, you know, they're all over the n a d  Phn ADP nadh are really important. Okay, and so their functions are redox reactions or Co sensor and tons of different reactions and catabolic enzyme so often it's involved in and helping oxidized things like in the Krebs cycle and nadph is often biosynthetic and submitting nadph is more of a reducing agent has nothing to do with the chemistry of these things so that the half cell potential if you want to go into the chemistry of nadph and nadh is nearly identical. It isn't the enzymes are specific for one of the other. So these are biochemical not chemical differences between these two co-factors. Okay, they come about half comes from niacin in food half is made from tryptophan sir. Tryptophan is a natural source of niacin and we can convert niacin from tryptophan. So protein is a good source of niacin causes excess tryptophan and requirements.  About 14 19 mg a day, but there is actually an upper limit because flushing can occur and I want it. I'll talk about that a little later than very interesting medical application of of Mega dose of niacin niacin deficiency is another classic deficiency syndrome called pellagra, and that's has been described. Your many of these syndromes are described as people started Conquering the world. Well fed people usually conquer the world and they tried to conquer less Wellhead places cuz his butt up listen to fight at the totally unpolitically sophisticated thing to say and I really am not a history person. I don't know that but it's often something you do observe casually anyway soap Alegre means broken skin. That's what the word comes from the Italian and so one of the things you see is really terrible skin lesions from people. You don't know how does this person is highly undernourished as well. So yeah usually don't have just a vitamin deficiency. You have a hole. Decrease of of of of food provision and nutrition so wide.  Advantage of damage dementia delirium diarrhea dermatitis a death in about 5 days. And so this takes about two months to occur, you know from from the body stores. Okay, but what's amazing about this unlike what I just said where you have, you know, these these people than poor countries are not getting the kind of food they need or they don't have the resources to feed themselves correctly or appropriately this actually was a pellagra epidemic in the United States. It was very telling and very important to people to observe. So in about the 1920's 1930's around the time of the depression, you know, not far from then little bit earlier, especially in the rural South a huge epidemic of pellagra happened in which thousands of people died and probably many more people had it but didn't die and it happened to both men and women that the rates are a little different, you know, the starting point three different Batman.  And this turns out to be purely nutritional. This was purely nutritional turns out that occurred in the south in the 1930s were about 10,000 people died. And this is sometimes the Depression was 1932. So, you know is you're right about when there was a lot of stress on the food system in people's resources. Anyways, so alleged enough Delerium that a number of insane asylums were built in order to house the people who are showing this on unanticipated an unexplainable delirium but in the South so actually if you think about the diet, I mean they figure this out of the main foods in the southern died at the time with corn salt pork and black eyed peas, which is all very delicious. I like all those things. However, salt pork is mostly fat. It has very little vitamin content black eyed peas just happen to have very little niacin. They're not a good source of niacin corn is a great source of niacin, but it's the niacin is bound to a protein in it has to be liberated by tree.  Alkali is actually a very interesting socio-cultural last week about this native Native Americans and Native Mexicans have known about this was Central and memories of Americans the Native Americans have known about this for thousands of years. And the way that that the indigenous First Nation or is would grow their Maize and corn and eat it would be to treat it with Ash with Alkali and that liberates so nice. And so this is just sort of that cultural blindness that led to thousands of people dying not understanding the correct way to prepare corn. So it's kind of a little lesson in making observations. So Native Americans and Mexican Indians, but not at Europeans would treat their corn with the with lime water and alkaline. This is very common. Actually you can see dishes made this way, you know now it is so the ones that was learned it was easy to process the food or to provide niacin.  Okay. Now this another you may have heard of this that niacin is used for lowering cholesterol. You know, this is something that's been around. It's actually been around for a long time and it's a very odd set and circumstances. So it turns out that unlike most of the time that we have a vitamin or is that I've told you about where you know any molecule will do retinoic acid right now. This is a case where only one of the two niacin is very good at lowering cholesterol. However, you have to take about 1.5 to 2 grams a day. So this is way past that 35 M. EU will that causes flushing another side effects? No side effects in this case aren't bad. They're just unpleasant. And so it turns out that it is actually really good at decreasing out without LDL and increase HDL it is, you know, both of those things if you want to happen, but it requires quite a stir can lead to certain toxic flushing swollen tongue t a problem and liver damage. So I actually went to the trouble I wrote that's one of the things that's just awesome about being used.  Yes, this is crawling with these like World internationally recognized experts in various aspects of science. So this morning I was even on my phone I didn't even get my computer and I texted this guy Joe with some music position who's the world's expert an oxidizing modified LDL like we talked about he's right down the street. I've known him for 40 years. And so I said h l. What is the deal with nicotinic acid in LDL lowering? Like is there a mechanism like everything about nicotinic acid and niacin you think we'll have is nadh or any dph have anything to do with LDL and answers. That's not what it's doing it all if he's very high doses. It has all these other effects east side effects of he actually sent me a review article, which is amazingly complex and I will not burn it with you is about 12 different putative mechanisms niacin doing nicotinic acid for niacin and not nicotinamide finding a certain cell receptors affecting certain enzyme Pathways at these high-level. So it does a bunch of different things stranger.  Stop it all add up to lower your LDL increasing HDL. So it's actually a legit therapy and you can give profound useful clinical up changes. So this is actually in the Harvard Health publishing. This is actually really great website that Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health publishes. They have tons of position pieces on lots of different medical things. That's actually a real if you're Googling way to find something and you see Harvard Health publishing. That's a good place to read. This is, you know, a well-curated site where they're just really after getting information out. That's a nice. It is actually the granddaddy of this medication to lower cholesterol is in 1955. That was right after I was a good idea even the first to reduce heart attacks in 1984 the first to lower long-term mortality rate. So they've done all these epidemiological studies showing that I did that this niacin really works but since 1987 when Lovastatin that's one of the stantons that Nigel told you about that blocks agency choir reductase was the first  Standard Market in nice and has fallen into disuse. The reason is harder to take and it may produce unpleasant side-effects. So it's much easier to take a little stat until every day and millions and millions of people do that despite that it's you know, what pharmaceutical enzyme inhibitor? Okay. And so this actually now a wave of people going back to nice and so this is actually Reeve article from 2017 very recent niacin and heart disease prevention engraving is Tombstone is a mistake. So, you know people think it may be nice and something to try and often if you have high LDL and low HDL a physician is aware of this will first try you out on megadosing niacin. If you don't happen to flush if you don't happen to feel bad now, it's a natural compound and its you know, the gate doesn't have over Texas is ever that isn't it has these effects so, you know, it's a trade-off is something worth trying is there thinking  Let's do some quick attach, but they were zooming along do some quick attach.  I will look at these questions.  All right ready?  Are we good?  carotenoids are  here we go molecules found in carrots and other brightly colored vegetables are called vitamin D collectively are enzyme co-factors promoted transcriptional program to a specific receptor, which is it.  Which is it?  I guess it kind of gives him his carrot annoys annoyed.  vitamin E Foods  Okay, we don't have to go out too long on this plenty of you here today. Thanks for coming. Really appreciate the energy. Okay?  Not enough to plenty. Okay. Stop being you'll have other chances. Those are who are slow on the clicker draw. Okay, most of you know, the carotenoids are found in carrots and other brightly colored vegetables. Yay vegetables. Okay. Let's move forward a little bit Rich diet.  Has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer has been shown.  Okay.  Has been shown to decrease after the horses has been shown to decrease the risk of lung cancer increases the risk of coronary are cardiovascular disease, which is it a carotenoid rich diet. That means eating them carrots and leafy greens and those brightly colored things all them Autumn Leaves.  height  Are we to explore this we're going to explore this more in construction and another and other lectures does it very rich.  Topic I wait the very rich.  Topic. Okay. We're done enough. Come on 87. Come on.  We're waiting for you 87.  interesting a lot more variability  A karate reverse diet has been shown to decrease the risk of lung cancer that has a ratios lower. This is a large epidemiological studies. Pretty solid statistics does not do these other things, but now you might wonder why do they put a  Beta carotene supplements added to the diet, okay.  Has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer has been shown to decrease after this exact same set of answers. Okay, I'm making a point here. Okay beta carotene supplement. That's just a pill or a capsule with only bear beta-carotene extracted from plants or other sources.  Has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer has been shown to decrease after so somebody trying to decrease the risk of lung cancer increases the risk of coronary vascular disease, which is it.  There's a distinction.  Okay, I want to get on to the next still.  So are you just click out? You know, there's no wrong answer and clicking. It's all about the bonding in the community that seventh inning stretch. Okay, stop.  ESO number of you not all but a number understand that this is the weird thing is the substantial number of epidemiological studies that were done implied it carotenoid rich foods clearly lower the risk of lung cancer. So this crazy study that carrot study which is a cute acronym for carotenoid and a carotenoid enhance retinoic acid is it has an orgasm crinoids in a very large study of people with a higher risk of lung cancer that study enhanced cancer. It seemed like lung cancer statistics were worsened by people taking just beta carotene. This is a very interesting topic a student last lecture asked. Is there a mechanism is there a hypothesis for this was a wonderful question and you're going to figure one out in your discussion. So it's going to be cool going to be fun. But it turns out this is a very common observation that supplements the try to replace the presence of things in.  Foods are problematic are often ineffective. And why is really interesting question not an answer but a question. Okay, and one more I'm just curious I take some kind of supplement vitamin otherwise most days I didn't put everyday cuz maybe do it 7 days a week true-false.  It's your right.  What what? Oh, I turned it off. Damn it we go now we're going.  I take some kind of supplement vitamin otherwise  most days true-false. I guess I could have just said true that! Is a true.  I'm taking a stand and I refuse to say  we have four Rebels who refused to say.  No, 4% Holy crap.  It's fun to refuse though. All right.  All right.  So is it like they're worried like I don't want anyone to know.  We could deeply go into TriNet and find out if you take supplements.  Like I care.  Is there a problem?  people's battery died  All right, some people just don't want to click on that one. No problem.  Interesting. So 30. Sorry. I can't see up close with the glasses on I can't see anyways.  33% I think it says.  38. Thank you very much at 38%  Friends are fake. They just make me look scholarly 4% refuse to say that's cool. I'm not judging. Sorry. Maybe you don't know. It's a pill my friend gives it to me every morning. I feel awesome. That's called e, okay. So we have a few texts questioning few things some of these I don't know why do diabetics have a problem like fighting I think they have a difficulty with wound healing more than blood clotting. I don't think it's a vitamin K thing why your elbow rash is symptomatic of gluten intolerance? I didn't know that Celiac or non-celiac dunno I did. I didn't know that it would look into it if B12 stays in the body longer why do vegans have such issues we will talk about that beautiful weed in if someone who has who is an alcoholic and got the education room. Could it be reversed if  Became sober its yet. Meaning if they stop drinking alcohol you do, you know, you do stop blocking the uptake of the of the vitamin so it would help you know, that's for sure. It's not a permanent state, but it can hear the damage can build up. So I'll be good. At least I think what they do is they check the alcohol. I can give them a lot of vitamins and then hopefully also counsel them. Okay any questions in the real world?  Yes, sir.  I think the question is is it only when you're drinking? I think the usual alcoholic is drinking almost all the time. So the reason that it happens is the presence of alcohol affects the absorption and that's a frequent state for someone who's had to be drinking quite a lot to have a vitamin deficiency in that particular vitamin. So I think the answer is alcohol is present but that's often the case especially during meals, you know, there's a lot of people up and drink with their meals. Yes.  parrot  I think the main observation was the carrot with specific people with a higher risk of lung cancer asbestos in smokers. I think they also look at some other things too. But the main point of that maybe the the simplest answer was it was it was an it was a study that they targeted a lung cancer cuz of the promising observations from the dietary carotenoid and they were shocked to find that it went the wrong way. I mean, I think the people doing the study and there's actually a whole if you if you PubMed or Google the carrot study there's a zillion papers now trying to analyze what happened in describing it. So it's up. It's a freaking out because it was such a surprise. They actually had to stop the study because the data was strong enough that it was indicating. There was a real problem with this that it was backfiring. So, okay. So I'm sorry about vitamin B6 pyridoxal and this is another old friend. So I don't want to go into great detail and this again, these are the three vitamer is if you will of this, you know,  I said that our group can be these three things and they're all different ways of getting it up at paradoxal phosphate. This is the actual cover. There was another question to meet stop cuz there's a question if you take away the non-business and but leave the business and intact the B vitamins will the function of the molecules be impaired. Yes. And here's why do you have the business end like that? That guy is all ring and all this other stuff that other stuff is how it binds to the enzyme that other stuff is the footprint of the shoe that fits into the footprint of the enzyme says I'm going to use TPP. So those structures are very important in terms of fitting into an active site of an enzyme pocket and being recognized. The reason these enzymes are so specific is because they create a special pocket with a lot of low Affinity binding sites that say, I'm only going to buy TPP and a beautiful example of a new-look a 1080p it's his giant molecule with one tiny modification of phosphate at the bottom and that make  Difference between the enzymes that use in a deed for oxidative purposes in the enzymes used 1080 P H a reduction. That's a beautiful example of even teeny modifications of that non-business and will strongly affect the biochemistry not the chemistry the business and brings the chemistry the rest of it brings the biochemistry that makes some sense. Okay. Alright. Okay. So this is the cofactor and this one has an active aldehyde that's really what the Paradox in paradoxal and pyridoxamine is all about and the aldehydes are really mostly react with a miso the aldehyde reaction in a meeting for Micco the shift base and what ends up happening is the PLP aldehyde reacts with a lysine on a protein and forms. This thing raring to trade that nitrogen for something on an amino acid are very important enzymes will come transamination reaction that we talked about before where that this shift base is part of an enzyme.  Can trade off the through a set of electron transfers to make a shift base with an amino acid in the NBN D. And then that amino group is removed. And so one of the things that happens frequently is Hugo from from ammonia group some kind of an ammonia group 2A some kind of a carboxyl group. So the transaminases take these remove them somewhere and you get replaced with that back and forth know that's how alanine can become pyruvate in those kinds of things. We've already had you learn the cognate amino acids for a few molecules. Okay. So that's the end of vitamin B6 deficiency is a thing. So it's not surprisingly because it's involved in so much dynamics of amino acids in and the urea cycle and all these other things and end ammonia maintenance. Ammonia an apple is ammonia catabolism involves. Lots of different things. You can have the CNS effects convulsions in adults and children dermatitis and evening.  And also the one of the things about vitamin B6 which is not typical of water. So I advise you can have irreversible nerve damage by taking too much of that. So this is actually a B vitamin that can cause some real problems. If you take too much of it, we're talking like, you know, 50 times than normal amount you need but still it is that it is possible full 8 or folic acid forms tetrahydrofolate. Would you heard about in DNA metabolism one carbon metabolism. And so it involves it has several different groups is paradine parameno benzoic acid. This is also a dietary supplement, at PPL Center safe found a glutton mean in this is what folic acid looks like. Okay and folic acid has a labret chemistry that involves one carbon metabolism and how much you went over this in one or two, but this molecule can form a ring structure with different canvas.  Nitrogen here can bind to this one here can bind to methyl groups inform a ring in some cases or a free methyl. So these are involved in transferring methyl groups of things. I can find the things like a ump to make to make Simon Dean, you know, the one Bethel transitions that you've heard about. So there's a whole bunch of these different flavored versions of this that involved in the enzymatic cycle a function is single carbon metabolism in transfers either methylene group ch2 or methyl groups. Okay, so nucleotide synthesis of the main thing that's really important. Are they all important? But this D uridine monophosphate to defy media monophosphate and is actually this is a blockage point. So this cycle of methylating dump to make to make DNA precursors is important enough that they're chemotherapeutic agents like Methotrexate that block. Cycle until methotrexate work switches up popular cancer chemotherapeutic.  Amino acid synthesis is well. Okay, and so full 8 has a RDA and an upper limit. So it has actually this is cause increases the risk of colon cancer high doses of this toxicity and it can mask B12 deficiency cause vitamin B12 you remember cobalamin and we'll talk about a minute is involved in transfer of groups including methyl groups between molecule. So they often do similar reactions shows, but the deficiency of loss and DNA synthesis and that includes of megaloblastic anemia and spina bifida so you can get individual cell level and holds tissue level in addition deficiency leads to an increase in homocysteine, which will talk about cities are the three cases. So it turns out that folate deficiency is particularly strongly felt in blood cell development. So these are so when you have normal folate you get cell division of these a blood cell precursors called megablast, and if you don't the development of these spells free  Is there a certain point so indeed in the bone marrow? You can see so bone marrow is where you end up making red blood cells to the tune of billions a day and it was a lot of turnover of these and this is folate deficiency freezes. That's you get in a very powerful anemia that happens because you're not making appropriate red blood cells has happened that slower spina bifida is actually a whole body deficiency that happens during development of the spine tissue. So our children can be born who have this is number of causes but one of them is nutritional in which you don't get good closure of the of the spinal tissue and you can actually get the AAA a bursting through that looks like that new surgical procedures to correct this but it's a pretty extreme and perhaps the most important one in terms of us thinking about, you know, adult Health than these these mishaps soenneker is a fact that a folate is involved in processing Jen.  Raining in removing homocysteine. So methane if you look at the stars are shining it is it has a methyl group on it. And that methyl group is added by the enzymes by tetrahydrofolate and to make a pre first called s adenosylmethionine is a frequent methyl group donor Shepherd Coat Factory in its own light and it has a lot of different functions. And when is Hughes you generate homocysteine homocysteine is either broken down by vitamin B6 615 which is use or folate is used to regenerate methine in so you can get if you have a deficiency of vitamin B6 you can get a buildup of homocysteine which amino acid like it's not a traditional proteins synthesized amino acid. Is it in the blood and you can measure it but it turns out of homocysteine is very well correlated with cardiovascular disease.  The number of reasons so a high level of homocysteine in the blood can lead to endothelial damage cholesterol oxidation platelet aggregation. So this particular molecule because of its chemical reactivity and its biochemical features is actually a good diagnostic for risk of cardiovascular disease. So so low folic acid activity or other sources of homocysteine are important to this is sort of the blood levels of folate, which is used to make that teach at and this is homocysteine levels their Auntie correlated. So it's fully goes up. I'm assisting us down. So deficiency syndromes you start seeing it and it's truly can be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. All right. So then we talked about vitamin B12 B12. This is crazy crazy cofactor. It's a crazy vitamin is huge and basically what it is. It's a holder for Cobalt II ion, so despite all this fanciness. They're very complex structure know you don't have to know it. I don't know it but it didn't.  Charles is chelating wrinkle Decor in ring right in there. So there's a car in Rainier and it is basically a holder for Cobalt which has all this beautiful chemistry to do covalent transfers free radical type Coney Island transfers and maybe one that I talked about in my class was with odd chain amino acids, when you get down to propionyl coway vitamin B12 dependent reaction rearrange is that new get succinate out of the other end and that's when it's actually a pretty important as we generate a lot of propionic acid for microbiome. And we also generated as a as a breakdown product of amino acid B12 has lots of functions. So cool by land is used as a cofactor new variety of covalent group transfers were a group is moved from one part of a molecule to another and so probably a very famous disease is called pernicious anemia and send it send anemia meeting low red blood cell low hemoglobin levels and nerve degeneration. And it turns out this is a pretty fancy vitamin D.  See it say it say an autoimmune disorder, like other ones we talked about the Destroyers gastric parietal cells. Remember to the parietal cells in the in the in the gut and impaired B12 absorption occurs because parietal cells secrete a factor called intrinsic factor is a protein that binds to vitamin B12 and allows it to be taken up by cells. So if you if you don't have this Factor you cannot absorb it. So the treatment is vitamin B12 injections. Why do you have to inject it?  Not going to get some sort. That's right. So, you know when you can even for a while people were measuring people with vitamin B12 deficiency giving him supplements and nothing happened. So it turns out that's because if you give the supplements that can absorb it so it's a it's a thing. I actually had slightly low red blood so I got all these tests cuz I'm a newlywed looking for Medicare I went and I have slightly low red blood cells and they did all of this analysis including B12 methylmalonic away, which is a product of two B12 reaction a whole bunch of everything's and then they measure the end of the show must have been a mistake. I got all my numbers. So that's cool. So sources of B12 in this actually in packs directly and when someone asked one of the questions, is there a few bacteria make b12 with animals and plants don't synthesize it directly. They acquire it. So herbivores get B12 from intestinal bacteria, like cows and such carnivores get it from me. So it's highly concentrated.  Liver, the people only get B12 from animal Foods the richest sources liver some from Maggi up. So this is interesting plants don't make B12 is a major problem for vegans. It's a major wrong reviews is there is no non non-animal sources of it that are abundant in humans colonic back to and I actually scour the internet. I thought this sounds like a conspiracy there must be some way there really are very few ways. So at 90 and 59% is stored in liver. And then you actually have about a 2 or 3 years supplies. If you become vegan and I'll pay attention is it takes a very long time to start having symptoms from this and it's it's so actually I looked into this and it turns out there are numerous websites for vegans and including ones that aren't selling vitamins cuz you had to be very suspicious if they say yours B12. It turns out that the recommendation for vegans as they should take four to five vegan foods that have B-12 added to them from some Humane or vegan appropriate source of this is actually  My friend is a philosophy professor at USB and I intended to text him and say how do you take care of B12? If I go? I didn't know the philosophy guy who knows better B12 or you know, very few need very little of it a couple micrograms a day. So that's good news. And I've got probably that plus the three years store means you can get away with not taking it for a long time. But didn't you can get very serious you can also get megaloblastic anemia from this nerve degeneration fatigue High homocysteine levels, cuz that cycle involves B12 also not a good thing to have chronically low B12 and vegans usually a phenomenally good after, you know arterial health because they don't have a lot of of animal fat in those kinds of things are preserved cardiovascular house. It would be a sad irony to be B12 deficient in be a vegan. Okay. So I think we will do is stop there cuz I want to tell the vitamin C story completely and I do have office hours at 4.  If you want to come by, so talk to you on Thursday. "
