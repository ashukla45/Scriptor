I'm learning so much just from getting this together at a Breakneck pace. So that's great. I think we're all going to learn a lot together. We're doing our text questioning. I've already gotten a couple in there. So amusing ones here. Let's see I've got do we have to go to the sketch effect. We sign up for if it all possible after you signed up for it, but we would like you to go if you can if you have undue hardship. No, can we have pictures of your cat? Hold on.  Hey, bro, can you put the tea email? And yeah, I got it be running San Diego rock and roll rock and roll half do clicker questions count they do at in a small way and I will make that clear next lecture. I promised turn off the light please. I said I just happens this happens every time. Alright, that's enough for that. Turn up the mic feedback. See this is the drawback feedbacks the drawback. Right right you guys, all right.  Can you place a grade breakdown? Yeah, I will break down right there. So we have those things are artificial sweeteners bad. That's a complex and very interesting question. Sugar is really bad artificial sweeteners, maybe bad. So we'll see. So here's some popular text Ira lecture. Hey Randy are the Lakers sides going to be posted online. Can you post a PDF to slides before class and the answer is yes. I actually was rolling to do this, but then I had to interview this fancy MD PhD students who might come here and that is awesomely fun. But it put a big slice in my morning. And so I was very late. I posted these These are now posted. I'll give you a minute to download. So if you go to Triton Ed that now have posted lectures for the coming that's what they did this like an hour ago and emails you were so you can download PDF summer.  Come on your tablet or look at the power points are give the power points at home. And you go home to do your laundry and pressure, press whatever. I'm so you can have both of us. And what I will do is convert these posted when hold on I can do this. Hold on I'll convert these posted ones into the actual delivered talk. So, you know, cuz sometimes is a little different since we don't get through all of them. Sometimes I add a little color items and whatnot. So what we'll end up at by the end of the day will be be be delivered things that someone else asked could we have the TA in discussion fiction information that's now available also. So these are printouts of the of the all the t a r i a t a s phone number. I not phone number so emails office hours. Each ta also is having a private office hours somewhere. They are pretty cool place to buy coffee card price Center. So each one has an office hour plus if the email so you can contact them with your need to  And also the discussion sections are listed are where they are and who's who's directing that men we've already done the Wednesday ones. I know you got your first taste of a quiz scussion all this about you and your needs not about nutritional items in inches not to stress. So but that's their basic flavor. That's what they're going to be about. Okay.  Another popular text, you're way too young for us to be our grandchildren. I beg to differ. Okay Susan that I am 64 deleted. So here's my birth.  That's supposing I didn't do this at age 22. I had a child. That's very common. Hey, and that child grow to be 22 and had a child and then that child grew to be you and your 18 to 22.  20 40 60  So yeah, I am I am sorry to tell you. I have your grandchildren. I grabbed your grandfather.  I'm immature enough to be your grandchildren, but old enough to be your grand parents. So that's why I say my grandkids because it seems more age-appropriate number Sallisaw. Okay, some people want to see carbon the cat that's carbon and that he's in the carbon area. This is his niche of the house and you can see if he has an ocean view. It's the world's best cat and I discovered I bought this webcam to watch him when we first got him and I discovered I really only need you to still camera cuz he sleeps like 20 hours a day. Like literally he sleeps constantly. This is why he's up waking us up at 3 in the morning. I can't come over and do something sleep 22 hours a day and he was all like Hitman they are lazy 20 hours. I'm good to go. I got shit to do anyway.  Sections in you you can travel section A started yesterday a bunch of you went to sections this discussion group base. You're going to formal discussion group three or four people usually something like that and that's going to be your discussion group for the rest of the time. You're going to work out problems discuss things going to know each other watch each other Rise through the ranks of biomedical science to become powerful people in 20 years chart for whatever that is and up and you'll develop a connection with your classmates in your iata. So that's and you will mow over interesting problems in nutrition from class and other sources to so that's the hope I have office hours.  I lived I lived to tell the tale actually worked on stuff. I had my computer there, but you are welcome to come. I don't bring questions or don't, I guess you didn't find me to give you can come for any reason whatsoever. And I really like to meet people and they casual the Casual environment of the of this room. We sit in but no one came yesterday, which is okay. I get it got your stuff to do sleeping 20 hours a day. So that's fine. No, but I'm there 3 to 4 and maybe 3 to 4 hours and so good. I guess we can click that because I thought perhaps just everyone's got things to do at 3 to 4. So I'll ask you that a little later.  Okay, so the textbook were using for the classes. This is Warren laws for sex practice in nutrition. I get a lot of the figures from this it's it's very good book. It's full of a lot if it's very current they have guidelines for 2020 even so it's pretty up-to-date and you might not be surprised to hear this but there are a huge number of nutrition textbook nutrition books nutrition sources is a really great videos that will that I'll make you aware of that are from different websites is a huge huge government presents in nutritional analysis to there's a lot of resources dedicated to trying to figure out what good nutrition is both for legal and Regulatory reasons was also just for reasons of good interface between science and health, you know, it's a it's a it's a very healthy usage of science buying tax dollars in Leavin talk a little bit about that today. Okay, so we were talking about we were talking about  I'm going to try something else out there. I did it last snow human could use you need to be like an angry Hulk.  Okay, I going to do this is going to be cool. I'm not quite tall enough to be your grandfather know but I've been doing this order. This is the texting number you all know that and I just make a little term Corral and I put the terms that we talked about in here. So we talked about phytochemicals.  And those are things a variety of nutrition-related things that come from plants Fido means plant-like Fido Club. The first rule of Fight Club is don't say your a plant and then we have Zoo chemicals.  Which come from animals in zoos the San Diego Zoo now they come from from animals. So a good example of one of these is you know, like seafood Leah Remini fatty acids are used to make the essential multi desaturating. He's omega-3 fatty acids that we'll talk about it length, then get them some fish and krill and other things that are a very very good for one's lipid balance. I'm so that's good example of that and it's just a collection of these a bunch of these phytochemicals that are under study. So there are thousands of phytochemicals. I mentioned in the lecture last last Tuesday is that is that in a single cup of coffee this a thousand different molecules a thousand. It's unbelievable how complicated things that are natural are and you know, one of the interesting things we don't know is to what?  Extant are nutrients that come from sources that basically are natural healing people say natural that we're going to try to parse with that really means cuz usually a molecule that comes from a plant is pretty much identical to the molecule if it's a small molecule that a chemist makes that you making it has to be there really structurally identical and leave the laws of quantum mechanics tell if they have to be the same in very profound way. However, when you extract something like, you know a vitamin from a plant you're one of the things that's really interesting about the difference between natural food sources in process food sources is the changing and loss of this vast blizzard of different small molecules that might be of use to us when we're trying to figure that out and what you start hearing as people say, well I only take Vitamin C from rose hips  Are there other stuff in there or you just feel better about taking it and it makes you do better and all of those all of those are important in a one of it. This is a little bit of a hyperlink. But but one of the things it's super important in nutrition and exercise is because you know a 10% benefit or a 5% benefits of real thing. That's really in the range of what we call the placebo effect and I'm not even again, I don't like the word placebo effect because I think it has it cast and negative Pony idea that we in weird nonlinear ways can participate in the outcome of things. We do, you know, like if you believe that you're a exercise regiment is going to make you better you probably will perform better food. It's a little more interesting question and always there if you believe you're taking some nutrient that makes you feel better more energized you may well feel more energized so that this a crazy study this is a little bit of a hyperlink, but I just think you'd love to hear this era studies now where they have observed the placebo effect when they tell the people at  Placebo that is actually documented statistically significant difference and they still show a quantitative difference between not getting it which to me is just amazing. So I guess we all want to do that. So these kinds of things are bundled up in this issue, but these are just the zoo, consider being studied. So now they're mainstream ones. I like them some of the vitamins we talked about those come from plant sources many of them but these are things that are a more obscure. They're not considered nutrients in the sense that you need them to survive but they might have all kinds of benefits. So there's a number of people study these in many labs and they know it's a really interesting idea. Another place is super important is the supplement industry and we've talked a little bit about this lasted in exercise class, but supplements are an incredibly interesting and pretend  Very problematic source of fito and zoochemicals because they're almost totally unregulated are unregulated in this way is drugs. Now, I don't know how much you know about this and you can teach a whole class about Farm to Pharma pipeline meaning the pipeline from basic Discovery Target identification science to the clinic and giving a drug December and you know, it's a long road I've done this before but if you'd if this is the research part, let's say it's 1 to 10 million dollars. If you have a million bucks, you can run a very substantial research effort if ten million bucks, you can run a very major research effort for a few years. It takes about a million half a million bucks a year to run a small lab. It's about rate. If you want to take that cool idea and develop it into a drug Eve including having a charter company work over here. It's about a billion dollars of all the fees testing phase 1 2 3 and other phasing and I'm not an expert on that.  And the reason is it drugs have to be shown to be safe and had to be proven innocent. They are guilty until proven innocent. So Phase 1 trials are basically is anything bad going to happen. If a human takes it that's All Phase One trials tell and I'll do it a lot. So it's all about negating the idea that that are providing evidence that they're not bad supplements. This is a name and it's purely physical and Commercial. These are laws that got passed about supplements because they are from plant matter their Austin from edible things. So they are there less suspect like for instance that still be is this compound supposed to promote longevity to come from blueberries, you know, so you say how bad could it be blueberries blue-berries the best proof I have that God exists such a beautiful little tasty round awesome thing and  I don't mean that in any denomination always early secular statement, whatever you want to do, whatever you want. But anyway, but when you get a chance, you would measure the size calculator this a couple days ago for fun year is about 100 kg of blueberries worth of her still being in a capsule. It's just a crapload of it. So who knows, you know, what is 90 kg of blueberries that you have to prove demonstrate their bad before they get taken off the market. So they're put on the market so nice to the tunes of thousands or millions of people taking then before and he the best example, I had you guys talk about the exercise classes. There is a an exercise supplement called craze and craze has in it a synthetic methamphetamine analog  That's a whole other story. But but that's because it there's really almost no regulation. In fact, there's a website now, it shows all of the pharmaceutical compounds that are in over-the-counter supplements there off and put in there because it just sort of an arms race between marketing and detection in the age of the internet. So supplements are very interesting should they're also really great ones, you know, so it's just it's one of the Wild West in the regulation because they are innocent till proven guilty or his drugs are guilty until proven innocent. So what works well in the legal system is it not enough for the best the best way to work in the Pharma and supplement pipeline, but it's interesting to know that anyway,  So how are nutritional questions study like one of the things that we here all the time, as you know, the study did this and we found out that and I've come to realize and I think I need to actually Jack this up a little in the in the exercise class A teacher maybe this class and day is it in order to understand those kinds of findings? It's really important to develop inability to look at how those findings were obtained and the trouble is that as I said a small effect like a 10 or 15% of fact on some measurement you like blood LDL levels or performance in an exercise task or you know, something like a cow protein in the brain is hugely important number for instance. If your potassium blood potassium levels double that would be hugely problematic. It's only a two-fold difference. So, you know when you have studies that we are measuring things.  Figuring out what you're seeing another statistically significant. How is observed is a major issue? So I think this has to you know, b and end biology is becoming more of a quantitative science, which is a great. Thanks. That's a good thing. Okay, so I just thought I would talk a little bit about some of those studies are done in this is actually pretty interesting and it will give you a vocabulary that allows you to think about these things, you know in a in a more refined. Well, maybe some of you already I don't I just don't see there's not a regiment or they're probably for all biology major should be assertive by Oak want biostatistics class. They're really think that probably like everyone should know, you know, what a meta-analysis is and what a you know, what these kinds of things are. So we'll try to get some of the way so you might wonder where do these questions even come from like where does the idea that LDL is good or bad come from and where is the idea that you know saturated fats are not as good as unsaturated fats. And so what are the places that  Date ideas, first come from are at water cause epidemiological studies and are the studies of diseases in populations, but they can also be syndromes, you know, yesterday's observation is tomorrow's disease, you know high LDL levels used to just be a biochemical observation and gradually people realize it LDL could be problematic and be symptomatic or causal of certain diseases and syndromes. So epidemiology is the study of diseases in populations and they these you know these studies and it's a whole feel of his stuff. You can get a PhD in epidemiology and epidemiologist for a living and they have incredibly powerful statistical tools that he's out Trans in populations in Ellen. The epidemiological studies were the first place if people will realize it's smoking was really a bad thing. You know, I mean, it's kind of funny cuz everyone's here to always guessed. It smoking was bad if you burn something in hell, it's probably bad for especially the first I hope none of you've ever smoked a cigarette, but I can tell you so you don't  How to do it yourself at the first cigarette you smoke you confer about 20 minutes and why that and then become something people can't stop doing is amazing to me. I don't understand that but everyone walks through that first few times of hating it to then become problematically enjoying it. So and Ebony but never the last epidemiologic size of the first things out this huge problem and as biomedical people in this position, so is it going to be physician citizens V one of the major causes of you know of of cancer in our population is still cigarette smoke and might have noticed is that young people have started smoking again. So people in my age bracket like 40 50 60, who am I kidding? 50 60 70, they don't smoke anymore. And it's funny. If you go to a scientific conference with people from all over the world, you can always pick the people who aren't American cuz they'll be a little cluster of a cigarette smoke coming from it.  For some reason by the United States is actually got a really good job of getting people probably scientist or a little bit more prone cuz they understand these studies but I can smoke again. So I just want to say something it's not really nutrition but it is a plant that we consume and we are a weed states are there Alternatives, but I have never in my old old enough to be your grandfather life ever ever ever ever. I know a lot of people had to have two best men in my wedding is I know so many people I liked our present and I know everybody they love me but I will say this I have never in my life met so glad I started smoking ever ever ever ever ever. So that's where I know I'm doing that old guy should movies worth.  When I was a kid, I was free, you know, I mean, I know this is annoying to hear I get it but this one old guy where was coming out of me this nugget, please encourage your friends who smoke to stop smoking. It's just if there's no upside none except maybe that you taste like an ashtray but there is no upside. So that's all I'm going to say about that. And that's a fancy name for just a situation where you have some K some medical observation people with extreme kind of cancer people who have knee inflammation people that you know, any sort of situation is medically definable and then the control the group that doesn't have it and you go to lengths to try to define the differences between those two and the very best case control study.  All other variables they can is many variables of the same between casein control to see what's causing it. So I suggest causation do anything to the populations you just find out about the populations and try to statistical methods to parse them out to weed them out. Okay. Now there's two other kinds of things can melt together but these are really common terms and you see them when you sort of peruse the internet literature medicine one of the great things about the internet is there so much information as if it's very very levels you can get information that's utterly useless in its Simplicity or information. That's so technically you can barely make your way through it and there's filters, you know, I would have been like. Stupid for me so I can let you know that that something so it took this is stuff for people who are dummies, but curious. I kind of curious dummy. That's what I am.  I need some of the spoon feed me this. I really a study where you compare or you look at some variable or some question in a set time and a group of people like you could say these people all walk this much at this present time and hear their cholesterol. That was that's an example of how much do you walk a day right now? And what are your cholesterol levels going to be a cross-sectional say what you're going to say. Goodbye by placing a cross-section through the group in a set time that were together and quiri them right then and there and there's no worry about history. There's no worry about finding out what happened what's going to happen. Then there are Sadie's called a longitudinal studies and Cesar through time. That's really out. So I will have case.  Controlled and what I need though, when I do this term's Corral who is that? I need someone from ta to photograph this cuz I always forget to document and then I leave the room and then it gets a race car with some t a i a could photograph this I would be so pleased. Thank you, and there's a longitudinal when we all know that word Lun Lun to to to know.  Longitudinal art through time through time. And so this really two ways to do that number one, you find a group of people who looks interesting and you know something happens to hey what happened tell me about your past to get here. So that's a a retrospective longitudinal study and then there's a prospective observational however, in a longitudinal study researchers are conducted several observations of the same subject over a. Of time sometimes testing many years and you can already see this is a lot harder to do right? Because if you just are asking question about right now to group of people you haven't had right now that's perfectly valid way to do a study. It's not very deep in terms of cause and effect but it can be done right that longitudinal study involves either figuring out what happened in the past, which is fraught with difficulties or keeping track of people while they progress through life or through what's going on.  So the two versions are a prospective study and a retrospective study. So prospective study is watches for outcomes such as the development of diseases or syndromes during this. In relation to other factors such as suspected risk or protection factors or whatever the said he usually involves taking a cohort of subjects and watch them over a long. Of time. You going to call him right? We're good to that CDs Eastern Co  fart, okay, and we have prospective by the terms are going to have to make a Chorale bigger perspective.  The one thing I've learned as a as a professor, maybe the only thing I've learned besides all that science of figured out how to write big with chalk.  spectator  chicken wing nutritional but you can see how important these would be for teasing out nutritional facts, like how obviously important this would be especially in the human population be trying to figure out things like is Arda are artificial sweeteners bad for you. When is the perfect example of that? Okay or steady watches for all comes with the starting group a retrospective study looks backwards and examines exposure to suspected risks a projection or any lifestyle, you know, a patient group or a group of people that do and don't have some syndrome and try to figure out what was different between the two in time. That's relevant. You don't know what's causing things. Okay. So many valuable case-control studies such as lean and clean ponds 1926 investigation a risk factor for breast cancer where retrospective investigation and one of the places retrospective investigation.  The sudden occurrence of some medical disease or something. You didn't anticipate like let's say a cancer cluster. Suddenly you find in a town 25 people get the same leukemia in a nice thing happened. The only recourse you have is if it's a retrospective study trying to figure out what happened. You can also do Environmental Studies and there's also think you do but in terms of what happened to those people and whether it really is a cluster that's super important because you start with a group and then see what happens and that is true but both are very useful. Okay, so a cohort and I started jumped ahead of myself as in statistics marketing and demography a car. It's a group of subjects. We share defining characteristics like you could be in a women between the ages of 30 and 45. It could be students, you know who are majoring in that people who live in the river on campus, whatever it can be any group of people who defines pretty open-ended.  I typically subjective experience a common event in a selected time. Such as occupation. Birth graduation, etc. Etc is all weird. And I don't know why that happened. Okay. So here's two examples of prospective and retrospective studies actually bring the lights down a little bit.  Cuz it's hard to see the script discovered. I once went up there and sat just for fun didn't give the lecture up there but I went up there and those little TV screens are like worthless. You can't even see if I can you give a good young eyes cuz I went up there I didn't I was like, is that a screen or what? This is my name right here, but I'm so this is a retrospective prospective study put in a simple term self examples of one. So this is a very famous that are going to go into more detail within which a very large number of nursing a female nurses were studied for a variety of reasons. And so the prospective study starts with a cohort without any assumptions about you know, and finds out about them. I mean a good Lord has to have some commonality you want to have more restricted set of features of that bit. There aren't too many kinds of finding variables. Okay, so you might have age limits you might have occupational.  Disston place where they are place where they work something like that other circumstances that are important. And so then in the prospective study you start there and you move forward in these studies can be over years or even Generations. So it sits there were there when people do them. They do them with very large numbers a very long time scales happen for in the biochemical literature is people want to know if caloric restriction which will talk about more causes longevity and primates. So, I don't know if you took my 102 class. We talked a little about this but caloric restriction meaning lowering. The number of calories in a balanced way is the very best correlated with longevity. It's really very true and it's super yeast rotifera spiders flies nematodes any kind of organism, but it's hard to test that would try me then you have to do a prospective study. Love you one good way to do it. And so the people take a group of primates or Reese's  Monkeys live to be 40 years old. So that's a prospective study that takes a long time and crazy thing. There was two perspective rhesus monkey studies one said yes caloric restriction improve aging and the other said no. After four decades complex results. So this is prospective and retrospective is, you know, you have things happening and you want to figure out in retrospect right. Now. What is happening to be retrospective. Respective I respect you, but this is a case where there was a study where a certain subgroup of people in a large industry. We're getting we're getting a certain illnesses and they they took the clerical people and compare them to people work in the manufacturing floor for a tire business, you know, and that would be figuring out the diff.  This is between know if the tire making was problematic. Okay, so this is a incredibly classic very famous study, and I'd actually impacts on nutrition and health in ways that wasn't the original intention to one of the great things about a prospective study is if you start with a huge group of people and Define a cohort the more information you tracked from those people the more different things you can explore like just because you started wanting to know this if you have light information a question may emerge that you didn't even know about so there are studies that have started before we even knew the DNA was a double helical molecule, and now people can in the in the late stages of those studies. Do you know genomic analysis? We don't even know the questions we can ask or answer in some of these things so big they're very powerful that way. They're their databases that transcend our limited creativity when the studies were made.  Nurses health study and HSA colloquial sanding name so that he was actually launched by a single and not 1976 who wanted to understand the degree to which birth control using birth control pills was problematic for Women's Health for many different parameters Because by the late seventies, right before many of you were a good idea there was a substantial numbers of people were starting to take birth control pills and they had not been really, you know, they not been on the market for a very long time. I mean again, they've been gone through that whole process of phase 1 Phase 2 3 and seemed quite safe, but you know the phase 4 is when they put a drug on the market find out with millions of people that's going to happen. So the nurses health study that was launched with over this is 71 / 217000. But if your number I read is 121000 Nurses they were all between the age.  3045 they were all married for various socio-cultural reasons and they've been they compared a number of different things. The original the original idea was to try to understand the effect of those drugs, but they collected so much information that it's a series of prospective studies is me epidemiology and long-term effects of nutrition hormones in health and disease development Studies have been among the largest investigations in your risk factors for major chronic disease itself this study now, there's now a NHS 3 meaning there's a third nurse health study. Some of these are the children of those nurses are not ended so it's just going on and on cuz once you have an infrastructure to do a study like that you can keep keep capitalizing on it. So this is the original purpose of this had some narrow Focus, but the information collection was so well done that they came up with a bunch of different things. So this is an example of a of a publication that came from the nurses health study.  What's cool about it is this isn't Journal of the American Medical Association Jama. That's a very very popular Journal. I'm sure if you become Physician's you will read many papers in Jama. We're jamming. This is a very popular the New England Journal of Medicine is another very very high-level important medical journal also, but this paper was in Jama. It's called wait wait change and coronary disease in women. An interesting thing is it's risk within the normal weight range. So what they did was take this huge cohort of people of nurses who have similar occupations no similar broad age bracket similar socioeconomic background or socioeconomic lives and then analyze different many different aspects. And so I want you to notice. First of all, you see this is prospective cohort study, so you not know what that means. It's forward in time setting female registered nurses in the United States. That's what the nurse study participants a total of 15818.  3256 years in 1976 with well without a history of previous coronary heart disease fchd mean so main outcome incidence of CHD defined as non fatal fire departing flights for fatal cardiac cardio cardiac heart disease. Okay. I'm so this is some sort of thing and end the amazing thing is that with this prospective study that she's out a Clear Connection in Risk to these diseases in a weight range is relatively normal to the body Max index you may or may not learn. This is a pretty crude indicator of obesity. The reason it's pretty crude as it's based only on height and weight for someone who's very muscular and lean would have a high BMI as someone who is obese and and not muscular. So it's it's it's an incredibly good Public Health device and Anna prospective study 100,000 people if they're very valuable way to bin people in a manageable way, you know, but if your BMI  High or low that doesn't say much about your particular state of health until you understand that your body composition all that and you have someone with a BMI of 30 immediately want to know what they're there their fat composition was with their exercise and diet was liking and why they have a BMI of 30, sometimes it's just really obvious. They may have a BMI the tide simply because they have a high muscle mass one of those things unhealthy like that's that's a very slim person and up around here. Another thing is going crazy. I can't help but you get to sit on the podcast or just great. This thing about dmize is sort of like a log scale like it's a very broad range of weight and Compass one height so you can go on your computer there tab  Look up a BMI calculators hundreds of them on the Internet. And if you punch in your weight and height will tell you what your BMI is and then you can play with your what if I gained 20 pounds and you would see your BMI will still probably be pretty close to normal heart will be in the normal range cuz that range is quite big. Okay, but the interesting thing is here is percentage of number of non-fatal heart attacks. So this is many many people but you can see it doubles person years of observation. So these are in person years of observation mitochondria. In fact Park rate per hundred thousand person-years infarct is not something that happens every day to everybody which is good news, but you can see it it goes up almost all most triples with within a body mass index range and the rate race is the ratio of the rate change. This is the change from low BMI. Now, you know you my trees illegal will how how you know, how unique a variable is that? What about other things that cause BMI in those are  Really good question. What kind of studies are good for is generating hypotheses. Hypothesis is you know, what you say might model is it this perturbation causes this outcome? That's the only hypothesis if this if I change this then I should have reserved that, you know, it's an experimental idea. Okay, and one of those beautiful things in general is that we're always trying to falsify are a one way to view experiments is we we are only interested in information that could be falsified if an experiment can be done. So the idea that this counter loves me more than any object in the universe is not a testable. I cannot falsify that even if I trip over and it hurts me that's my fault. It's still loves me. So, you know, that's that's not a testable thing. You can't falsify that information. It seems very unlikely that something may be such a simple molecular structure would be able to do that. But who knows?  Who knows what the universe has in store for us? But there are many things you can also I like the boiling point of water is 50 degrees Centigrade. You can test that and say no it isn't a bunch of water and five Labs didn't study but that's the basic idea. Okay. So how do we ask questions? We can use animal experiments or human experiments with really incredibly exciting right now right now is it were that age where where genetic manipulation has unprecedented specificity and an alacrity now, it is incredible. I'm sure most of you heard of crispr cast 9, it's almost like I'm Hallmark cards near crispr modify you for the best Merry Christmas, you know, I mean, it's it's so it's at but the thing is crazy is that came out like 8 or 10 years ago, like it's really really current, you know, it's it is completely change the face not only  Mental science, but you know of a biotechnology and maybe even culture, you know, we already have at least a pair of humans who have been modified permanently buy a crisper cast 9 Shenanigans. So this is a whole other conversation and really an interesting one. But so we're at an age where their genetic manipulations are completely facile words used to just be like a pipe dream. Another thing that's important about that is actually a great I'm not going to put in the terms as but there's a wonderful podcast guy named Peter attia.  I don't think podcast fan. I think podcast would like the microbrewery of the information age and I was just a million of them and you can do anything you want. They're like the wild west with Peter attia is a and he's very interested in trying to integrate the wellness longevity biomedical literature with actual medical practice and he interviews all kinds of experts type of Diabetes the next person sleeping just very entertaining podcasts. Plus he trains down at Mission Bay on Sundays. You can go hang with him. If you can ride your bicycle fast enough, at least that's what he says on his bike cuz I've never gone down there to see that you know, but  He actually is is a very big proponent of these kind of things and he wrote a wonderful wonderful prospectus called The Mousetrap. This guy's me. He's a he did basic research and then you became an MD and I just think this is a really interesting tract and I will actually posted on the Triton Ed site for anyone who wants to read in this is not required reading. It's just think it's interesting about the idea that trap.  Okay, the idea that so much of a biomedical information. We have been done with mice and that's for good reason. You're afraid congenic mice. I mean when you have a a bunch of mice out of the same of the same strain are basically clones of each other. So it's like to be able to do a thousand individual twin study. You can manipulate one Gene and change it. So it's amazingly powerful but also it is, you know one very isolated genetic outlier in a world where humans are very different from that, you know, every single one of us is every 500 base pairs were different. So, you know, we are extremely very genetically from each other and you know, there's a lot of effects it don't come out in a simple mouse that he still observation things about crispr is you can manipulate DNA if you're clever enough to get those tools of molecular tools into the organism. So it's going to be there going to be an explosion of what we call Nan model, Oregon.  Simpson on model organism studies that you will all be benefiting from his pretty pretty awesome and pretty incredible. So animal Studies have a bright future but bottom line call organisms or whatever is you still have to figure out ways to do human studies. The human studies are still you know me the ultimately the most important way except for veterinary medicine. Any hypothesis must be examined. Like if you have a hypothesis that this particular dietary manipulation causes Alzheimer's cuz you did a rat or a mouse model of it. You still have to figure out ways to understand two tests. And so, you know, the the ID of human experiments is critical and there's many amazing nutritional experiments with humans that we will talk about throughout that, you know throughout the throughout the quarter and some of them are prospective retrospective like hey, what did you eat? Why are you sick or here sign up for the study? And what did you eat?  But there are plenty of time to actually take groups of people and feed them different things and see what happens and chocolates are there actual hypothesis-driven experiments. So the best idea. Maybe this is a little bit over but I wants to make sure we're all on the same page or whether called double-blind studies. So, who knows what a double-blind study is?  Yeah, I'm about to subject and the researcher. Thanks the subject and the researcher are both unaware of the of the of the scientific manipulation and it is it right. Now you might think you know, what why can't it just be the subject why can't the researcher knowing the fact is there are tons of examples of research are caused by us. You know, basically the problem is that scientists are human. I mean, it's not a problem for human and you know they want and there are all kinds of ways especially in studies with other humans were the effects are fairly small like, you know, what exercise science is a perfect example as usually, you know, a researcher will have a desired outcome. Like I'm hoping this manipulation will improve performance. We all want to be negative information. That doesn't work at Thomas Edison found amongst his 800 is useful information.  You can tell a lot of people about so we'd like to learn something new and usually that means an experiment working. So, you know, double-blind studies are super valuable. Another aspect that is really part number called crossover study so across I don't even know what a crossover study is.  It's a little bit trickier. So crossover study is when you have a control group and a manipulation group, you let the experiment run make your observations and then switch the group's you cross over. Now, the control group becomes a test group of the test group and control group. And that is a very powerful especially if you can do a double blind to a third party is controlling who becomes crossover and when that happens so nobody knows what's going on except for a third entity because a crossover studies any differences between the two groups that are caused then get wiped out when you switch it if you still see the same effect. So this is how it's actually it's kind of thing. You might not know the name, but you probably think of it if you're doing an experiment like, you know, it's a pretty intuitive a very powerful way to self control and experimental, okay.  So this is the basic scientific method. This is from our book and you probably have all her this can be a science major take all kinds of the scientific method and you know, it's an ongoing thing. That's a really interesting basically have an observation made in this could be epidemiological stage something like that. So many people that you know, it seems like people who have extra weight are more prone to get type 2 diabetes this I'm a physician. I have been practicing for 25 years. I've seen that or an epidemiologist says it's interesting the groups. I've been into the higher BMI have a higher incidence of you name the illness or in the people who don't eat this particular nutrient seem to have this particular syndrome. Those are you know, the observations to be anecdotal and there are many examples of anecdotal observations that have great power, you know, and then there could be epidemiological were some status to  Something is teased out a trend and wants to know if Israel so that generate a hypothesis. You know, I think that that not eating vitamin B12 causes pellagra, you know, and so you can find that out and then you have some kind of experiments conducted and I want to say something is I run a laboratory and I have really incredibly awesome people work in my lab and I've been lucky to do this. I've trained for 13-14 phds they've gone off from the world migrate stuff. And we all together have learned of this green square should be the size of this room because the hardest thing to do is to figure out how to ask that question experimental. I told my people this a million times actually is really heavy younger the grads of Life who recite this but science is troubleshooting like the hardest part of doing science is not interpreting the data. It's figuring out how to correctly and usefully get the did how to get the system to answer the question. You asked without confounding problem.  Difficulties of data analysis or or or acquisition. So a big part of it is is that this is an art to figure out how to ask a question at the lab bench or in other modalities to do that and your findings evaluated by other scientists. So one of these about Sciences, it's not science until someone else read it and analyzes it and agrees with it. They don't have to like it. View this part of getting it out of the world is part of science experiments is not science. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition for science science is the group effort of taking these studies and integrating them into a whole body of knowledge your follow-up experiment conducted to confirm or extend the findings and for small lab science, like we work on how misfolded proteins are detected and destroyed really cool topic very relevant medically really fun, very interesting, but anybody could take the experiment publishing in an afternoon or to reproduce them. So there's a  What about one of these studies in this thing? I told you about where you have 30,000 people with breast cancer taking this new antibody or not. And you got to find it. How easy is that to repeat? Okay, let's do it. All again. Get 30000 more patience like that is really hard. So, you know, this idea of reproducibility of experiments is very challenging sometimes and unfortunately, the hardest instrument to reproduce are often the ones with the biggest impact and I don't think the research were doing in my lap, which is really good and really is going to kill anybody if we publish something wrong, we don't publish things that are wrong, but if we did is not going to kill anybody, you know is on the other hand. There are clinical studies that were not well conductor or even sometimes not nearly as often as you'd believe from the media which likes the clickbait thing, you know, the news is not go over. Well if you say everything's fine. I'll click on that. You want to hear disaster catastrophe in problems, but it is true that sometimes people will do an ethical things to publish.  Scientific study. So this is why you no follow-up analysis is so important in any hypothesis is either accepted or rejected in this is one of the basic scientific method. This is actually from your book and the book actually has is a beautiful book, but it is sore. I guess you can read this year. Let me see. I'm coming up put away your first person shooter names, grandfather.  See what I did was stretch it. You notice how it looks a little funny. That was a circle in the middle of stretched it out to make it look like a lot of lock it but that's I guess it's readable not on those crappy. Oh wait we can do this.  Pretty good. I mean face pretty little screen wrapping.  I give you stole these little ones for your frat house or whatever. You be like hero I do. Okay, so they're not worthless for the sky group Austin. I don't mean side group like marginalize. I just mean positional. This is actually aboard a more detailed when it would end. This is actually been on going and going on is he have you have observations eye physicians indicate the type 2 diabetes is much more common in obese patients and patience in this is easily observable. You have epidemiological studies show that type 2 diabetes is more commonly found in obese populations of me or once this is not the whole story to say it is a it is a predilection it is it is a causative risk factor there plenty of all these people who don't have type 2 diabetes and there are people who are no beasts.  So it's not you don't like black and white. It's not like Mendel's peas. You know, it's more complex that your case control studies show that obese patients are much more likely to have type 2 diabetes then lean comparison groups that are gnats. So this is the now you have a stress you try to really match as well as possible different lifestyle things. You smoke do you exercise? Where do you live? You know, how old do you all this kind of thing? And then you can have laboratory animal studies which are millions of these that he's gone type 2 diabetes is a very hot topic because so many people have it, you know, and we'll actually have a lecture on diabetes and talk about that but it is a major field of research for good reason and then you can have human studies where you can either, you know conduct weight loss in people who are have it or you other things are certain surgery strangely enough to seem to reverse type Dubai diabetes in very hard to understand why so, you know, those are can be considered experimental protocols. And the thing is they all work together.  Mortenson Sciences, it's a definitely a multi-person multi input thing. You know, we love the idea of the one brilliant scientist to figure something out but usually they either figure something out that is a great hypothesis or they figure something out. But everyone else was going to buy a lot even you know Einstein, you know, the theory of relativity, which is young pretty much alone person came up with a didn't you know,  Crazyshit, but the fact is ignoramus body of experimental work is going into testing theory of relativity and showing that it makes so much sense would like wonderful things like, you know, who is passing over stars in the leg in the light just incredibly incredibly cool experiments by as a group and you could even positive I'm probably getting what we say that science is a spiritual thing because it makes each person participating part of something much bigger than themselves, you know, if there is a secular non-denominational version of spirituality has to do with working in groups to a common good purpose does dubious practices still work. This is just a crazy story. I thought I'd throw in here. This is Joseph goldberger and Joseph goldberger was brilliant guy and he was studying and a syndrome called pellagra.  Play a deficiency in vitamin B12. But at the time in the early, I think the late eighteen hundreds of the early Nineteen Hundred people thought it was some kind of disease that would you know some kind of miasma some kind of some kind of illness that floating through the air the idea that it was nutritional seems unlikely cuz it's so nasty. And so he hypothesized it was caused by poor diet is experiments including feeding healthy people poor diets, and you get you need a really poor diet to get to developer options. Good diet. That's a good thing. He and his assistants also injected himself with pellagra patient's blood and took capsules filled with their scabs and it didn't catch pellagra. So they didn't look like a disease. The trouble is ears after his death people finals were two cameras that you know, that crazy do Goldberg. He was right so he didn't get a lot of credit for doing this but  Sometimes just doing the wacky thing. Have you guys heard of helical back there?  Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers it's a bacterium and the guys who won the Nobel Prize actually ingested helical bacteria and gave themselves ulcers to to to provide really striking evidence cuz you seem like such a crazy idea mean ulcers have been around since humans have and they've always been attributed to some kind of stress and kind of, you know, some kind of internal biochemical neural input and it's quite clear that be subsets of vultures are microbiological, you know, if the stomach is a major a part of ulcers is a microorganism. So that's a very famous story.  Yes, sir.  Do what?  Now that's a gravy so the question is is is the source of or are there phytochemicals that affect by availability or another way to do it is you know the source like a like a rose hip approve the ability that vitamin C to get out in the body and that's definitely seeing this gentleman uses from bioavailability, which is the fancy word for 8 getting into your system from an injection or ingestion. And that's certainly possible. I mean one of the things is the way foods are presented some time slower is better. There's a pattern called glycemic index. We just how rapidly blood glucose goes up when he ingested and you know, there are different ways to present the same amount of sugar that bleach it slowly into the system of much faster. So beautiful really good.  Like you said mi could from myocardial something might of myocardial infarct. Thank you. So mi is a myocardial infarct stock-in-trade medical term, but I appreciate that anytime. You see an acronym tydl that you don't like let me know. Okay?  Am I let's add that to the term Corral, Michigan. Although there many Mi is in Michigan because they have to spend all winter eating meat and okay. Let me check this messy. We need to text Master General cuz it's just off the chain.  Do we have discussions this week? Yeah, Wednesday and Friday. I told you that in class, but but it's okay. You can miss a few it's going to be okay. Why is sugar really bad? We're going to get into that. It's probably more that it's the huge amount we eat and the  Fructose that we take okay, but if that's something people trying to figure out probably it's a combination of composition and massive amount. Do you live near Mission Bay I do.  I thought I'd surprise you going to go with that.  What are person-years those aren't the number of years I've been study times a number of people that have been studied. So it's an indication of the study's density. Good. I'm glad you asked that.  And this is some pretty fancy technical, you know, what vitamin deficiency is affected by trip deficiency.  Are the terms of the black with the only ones are going to show up on his aunt and stuff. Isn't that is just going to be on the exam. I got your number bro things from me. That's why I said I try to get as many here, but they will be at terms and study. This is going to be posted. Each week is MSG bad MSG transmitter glutamate, so I wonder okay.  Can double blind be used on Xbox that don't have a placebo? Well, it's hard you could have no treatment and treatment, but if the people know they're getting the treatments and it's the pussy was a good way to mask a treatment. Sometimes it's hard. Okay. These are out there that question to Rolling in and I know it's like the more I text the less you'll lecture and understand what these nutrients in such as deciding how much we need and it turns out this is something people have thought a great deal about and you can really think about energy providing nutrients and non energy providing nutrients. This is one place where government efforts have really been very very positive and very useful. So I want to talk a little bit about this. So first of all this the energy value of food and again, you know, there's a little bit of cantilevering if you took exercise physiology cuz it's all calories are all about energy. But who knows? What a calorie is Sky? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  You can just read them by there anyone know?  the calorie  Yeah, what's up with the new person?  Yes, sir.  How much water can a ocean?  I got some calorie is the amount of heat or energy. You need to heat a gram of water one degree Kelvin really or Celsius to the same scale? Yes. Okay, and sorry is that and that's a very tiny amount of energy and I was so a kilocalorie is a thousand times at so I can see we have a kilocalorie.  This is probably old hat for you chemistry types, but a kilocalorie is a thousand calories. So it's the amount of energy or heat. You need to raise a liter of water 1 degree Centigrade. Okay and a calorie with a Capital C.  Is a kilocalorie? Okay. So in in food, the way food is thought of it is in terms of calories as energy density. And the amazing thing is the way that measure the energy density is literally by burning them like bomb calorimetry is totally unfancy. It's like people want to go start taking foods and come busting them and see how much energy is in there and amazingly even though that's SuperCrew didn't there's a lot of steps between consuming of something and it being completely combusted, you know, in terms of of harvesting of bioavailability of calories. If you want to put it that way of microbiome microbiome digestion and removal of harvesting of the calories of nevertheless. It is a pretty useful gauge for consumption of energy. So food energy is more active Express in terms of kilocalorie, which equals a thousand calories if the sea in calories is capitalized. This is also signifies kilocalories. So a calorie is the amount of heat a Capital C calorie is the amount of heat it takes the race into  Picture of a thousand degrees of water at one of the cool things is that these macronutrients have a very uniform calorie density and they're amazingly easy to compute. So a a car with most carbohydrates are all carbohydrates that are like galactose glucose lactose fructose Manos multi dextrin. They all are about 4 kit for calories per gram. It's a very accurate thing. Okay. So a piece of bread has a 20 G of  I'm starting it roughly 20 grams is a piece of bread. So that's 80 calories right there. Okay, a Snickers bar 280 calories in protein is 4 kilocalories per gram fat is 9 kilocalories per gram. So if you want to lose a pound of fat 4456 g450x * 9 that's 90 that's over 3000 calories. So losing a pound of fat requires 3000 calories to be absent from input or burnt in case of this is actually pretty useful rules of alcohol is 7 kilocalories per gram and a gram of alcohol is roughly about a milliliter, you know, so you're young you can handle it and that's a lot of calories. So that's and we're going to have a whole lecture on alcohol cuz it's such an interesting nutrient.  What's a bit of a double-edged sword that's going on now is the United States and other countries to visit his pretty uniform. If you travel you'll see birds into this all over the world now have for any food that that's manufactured and sold as a grocery or in a food place. You will see a description of the of the nutrient value. And so one of the most important things I think is the calories and universities capitalizes kilocalories and it's everyone uses at it. Your textbook makes the rejoindre that they send them to use the little C, but they mean kilocalories are never talking about one gram of water being heated 1 degrees centigrade is just too small an amount. Okay. So this is actually pretty useful but one of the things any of you know is that you have to be paying attention to the serving size and the people that incredibly weird unrealistic ideas about what serving size is like who each one Hostess Twinkie from a pack. Come on.  Costco these really nice dumpling soups, and they're very easy to heat their tasty and they have dumplings.  turtles in them  It's a 300 calories per serving a serving of half a bowl of this one serving thing is like I've been eating like where this but nice nice labels actually have a great deal of information that will talk about in a minute. They have you know, the fat trans fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium. So how did the people know these things? So it turns out there's a government agency called the food and nutrition board and the food and nutrition board is put together by the national academies of science and medicine and engineering and it's an ongoing Board of people who are biochemist and food nutritionist who make recommendations for how much we need to how much we need to consume of both energy rich and a and a nine energy providing nutrients in hell and you know, I think it's important. I'm not going to write all this example of  Say what these things are briefly, you know, they're very especially if you want to be a physician's it's useful to know where all this comes from butt. So there's a daily reference intakes RDR. I will put that down here.  Tnf are eyes.  Okay, Saudia razor daily reference intakes that's how much of a person is in eggnog. The trouble is people are very an aide people of varying in size people very engender people already in a lot of different ways. So we did the trick is figuring out how to standardize these things. So there's a number of different things is estimated average requirement. So that's the average requirement for a population of people there's a recommended dietary allowances and I'll show you how these stack up there's adequate intakes. There's tolerable upper intake and estimated energy soap. This one here is where you start getting into shaking too much of a nutrient and these three are about how much you need for all to be well, okay, so they're all related to each other and the bottom one is estimated energy requirement. That's just how much fuel you need. Okay, we're not going to talk about that right yet because that's you don't usually store number of calories. It's based upon basal metabolism and show me the interesting thing is this is actually a nice way to put it so  Estimated average requirement is 50% of healthy North Americans would have an average intake if they consume the the estimated average requirement for this is a one of those statistical things are 50. So it's a place where 50% of the people would be satisfied with it. So you wouldn't want to use that as a standard for everybody's nutrition cuz half the people wouldn't the right amount but it tells you what the shape of the curve and where its position is recommended dietary allowances rdas, 97 or 98% of the people. So that's you know, that's a pretty safe indicator of how much people need to consume kind in. This is calculated by very serious studies in which you you you feed people different amounts and observe blood levels in different markers of  Of successive that the upper the upper AVM upper level is the amount where it starts getting problematic. There are nutrients you can take that are bad for you. If you take too many especially princes fat soluble vitamins are some limits to how much you can take without problems and you know, most of safety and is also a very interesting adequate intake and adequate intake is set for some nutrients instead of a instead of the recommended daily allowance. It lies somewhere between the RDA of you on this refer when they don't have enough information so often you have a good idea of like if you take this much everyone's going to be fine, but they haven't actually generated those curves. Are they get the 50% and the meaning of the 97% statistic records in like a standard deviation above me and all that those workers. They have to be generated. So AI is it useful case when there isn't as much information, okay.  So this is actually a pretty simple way to look at it is insufficient update intake is down here. This is increasing nutritional intake so insufficient intake is this measure here? It's below it would be below here is sufficient insufficient intake and then it around what's good is already anai. They fall in this range, you know an ETA are the estimated average requirement would be somewhere between here so half the people lose out and then up here is is is upper limit of what the range is r and the interesting thing about I thought this was really interesting cuz there's a whole lot of Food Science going on their whole department and you think that this would all be pretty nail down for most nutrients but adequate intakes our daily and take them out set for nutrients which are for which there are insufficient resources.  AR meaning one of those curved you really know how the population behaves based on observing or anecdotal. Okay, like for instance bone health or white blood cells, you know number and function. So for a particular Life Stage Group like rtaa, I can be used as the goal for usual intake, you know, if you're trying to decide how much you're amazing part currently essential fatty acids fiber certain vitamins and minerals are good vitamins and of choline and fluoride are all a i discerned. They have not figured out for any of those major nutrients what the curves are for people to you know, what the 50% point is in the 97 98% point. Is there still a lot to learn about these are these are pretty basic pretty basic nutrients including not just like weird phytochemicals or anything so intriguing  I want to talk a little bit about nutrient density. So the interesting about these dri's in the assist you can start thinking about what is being consumed how useful it is so you have on one side your energy providing macro macronutrients like protein fat carbohydrates and they provide energy and if you consume those and don't bring the energy they will be stored mostly is fat in a little bit of glycogen message that were very very good at doing that and then there are the nutrients that you need a plethora of them. I showed you, you know, the basic ones that are essential and is probably a bunch of phytochemicals are good for wellbeing. We don't know about yet. They don't even have a eyes let alone rdas and so the interesting ideas this concept of nutrient density. So I didn't think anyone has to do this is just the sort of good Dunkin experiment the head of government is you divide the amount of nutrient in a serving of food by your daily recommended intake next divide the calories in a serving of it.  By your daily calorie need scx the estimated energy requirement and then compare the two. So if food is said to be nutrient-dense, if you provide a greater contribution to your nutrients and your calorie lots of calories not a lot of nutrients is lots of energy but not a lot of of you know dietary benefit lots of nutrients and calories is orange really great source of vitamin C cuz it doesn't have that much sugar. It tastes good has a lot of vitamin c in orange is not a great source of calcium because for the same amount of calories that has been very very little calcium. So those are just examples in the most egregious case of some of these junk food. So you probably heard the term junk calories and junk calories is a very valid ID and junk hours are basically foods that have a very very low nutrient density and you know, that's that is because they're easy to manufacture is much cheaper to manufacture of soda with a certain flavor than it you know, what a healthy fruits are you will notice Jamba Juice cost.  Naked Naked Juice cost a lot more than a similar calorically dense Coca-Cola in a Big Gulp example that's in this is the nutrient profile of a Coke of an 8. Oz Coke and I'm a big fan of coke. I love it, but it's not very nutrient dense. And then this is a a cup of milk. Okay 8 oz of fat free milk Chia protein vitamin-a by Suze has a huge nutrient density compared to this for the definition of that kind of thing. So the trouble is that like I showed you you will see dri's. Oh we got one minute left. My watch has a GPS watch satellite regular go one minute. I know it's just 20 that I got when I'm on the right of it. So the deer eyes and all that stuff. I showed you the rdas in the eyes. Those are very specific for groups of people in different phases of Life different genders, and that's not very useful for a supermarket or for a food supply where you're trying.  She'll do a lot of people in want to have some of rule of thumb that's safe. But but not completely crazy. And so this comes to daily values and daily values are generic standards that were developed by the US Food and Drug Administration because dri's are age and gender specific. So I think I will stop there and we will continue and get into digestion next time.  I will remember where I am. "
