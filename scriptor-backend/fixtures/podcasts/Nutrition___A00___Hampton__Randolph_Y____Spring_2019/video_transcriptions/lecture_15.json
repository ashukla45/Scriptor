    "Full Transcript": "All right.  Okay, more and more dwindling people. So more and more clickers. Let's see a couple things. This is the Morton Salt girl from the salt camp in the salt companies that make salt and this is from 1914 up. Maybe you know about Morton salt or not. But this is been it is important to realize cuz we're not talking about this a bit and then more later that there is a salt crisis in our food supply and you're all part of it, you know it or not in this is a little teeny tip of the iceberg that we'll talk about. So that's part of it. I am working on the regrades but it's slow going many of you participated, which is awesome. But that it is actually quite a slog to go through them fairly. I stacked them from lowest to highest and get meaner as I go down. I'm kidding but you know, I tried to give the people who had the hardest time the biggest break and we got a 96  Okay anyway, right so but I want you to get with fair and that's at some point just take some time. So I'm hoping I can ruin this coming Memorial Day weekend and do it that that's though. I am looking at them now all is well.  I told you about this absolutely brilliant book how not to die that I really even though I know that reading books is sort of a little bit orthogonal to the undergraduate experience. Although I will say literature students read dozens of books a year. So I know it's physically possible for people in your age bracket to do this. But if there's any book that you read any book, I read one book. Ever which I know is not the case. I would say read this book. It is absolutely an amazingly interesting and enlightening book about the interface of nutrition and medicine and the disconnect between nutrition and medicine and actually a practicing physician. So this is not some of his decrying medicine. It's a really really important book and he has a cookbook now to the how not to die cookbook.  Practical uses for generating the kind of diet e talks about he's very much about fewer less processed foods Less meat more plants and there's just a thing that I think you would like about it as let me turn this up a bit more I can already I can't even hear myself the thing I think you will like about it is absolutely completely evidence based research like the book has it out for seven or eight hundred references mentioned in it. So it's all about the science of nutrition. It's all about retrospective prospective double-blind randomized. One of those terms are in there. And this person is very serious about tapping the scientific literature to try to understand what we do and don't know about the interface and the crossroads of nutrition in medicine and nutrition and health. So just trust me on this. I think you will really enjoy it.  Okay, we're using bold bold text question about Laura is sick to the text Master. General is a little ill today. And so it's me. I'm doing it because we can just have another i-86 extensive training so, you know hours of practice I'm kidding but I will do it be doing them from here. So I'm going to try to do it here. Can you please turn up the mic anticipate? Okay, so it's working but it's a little tricky cuz it's all you know, it's by user. All right.  So here's an interesting question. I like these questions to come out someone ask how much do Tums affect calcium levels. Do you know what I thought. I don't know actually. So here's the thing is I'm actually a Big Tom's fan. I don't know what the pictures not hear crap. Good question. How much do Tums calcium carbonate effects of acid discomfort, you know I have to do is frequently get heartburn pain. So the RDA for calcium, you know.  and  I don't doubt that okay, and so the uld the upper limits about 2.5 grams per day based on the danger of getting kidney stones acute will happen you but it's not a good thing. So I looked up this time. I must say these terms are amazingly delicious. Like these people are geniuses at figuring out ways to get you to take that because this particular brings my brand chewy bites berry-flavored are so delicious that I've actually found myself just grabbing a man eating them which I will not do anymore cuz his wonderful. It turns out you can find out the active ingredients not very deep. It's just calcium carbonate above. Yeah, you know the RTA right there cuz they're like a handful of delicious candy. So I am done with that.  That question that's actually a beautiful idea that you can apply this stuff to real life and that and I just didn't, you know, we don't always think all the time even when you're absent-minded Professor. Okay. So now we're talking about sodium. Okay, and  Think about the sodium is that there's no an average intake and an allowable intake and the amount recommended is around 1.5 grams per day gram of sodium is a pretty small amount. It's like a teaspoon around there. Okay, the upper limit in terms of risk is 2.5 grams per day in this class of medicine that there's an old phrase in biology only makes sense in light of evolution, which is a very interesting way to think about it, you know in terms of the sequence order a and comparing organisms and how we get from under their disease resistance. It's just a million ways that Evolution makes beautiful sense out of biology. That's why you know, that's why we we talked about it so much I think about it.  Cuz it really orders and explain and predict things in biology beautiful. It's not any sort of an idiom and the information we acquire the deeper. The information goes the more the evolutionary theory is stronger by molecular biology came around, you know, Darwin didn't even know how genes existed he had to kind of gas. But we're thinking about you came around and all the sequencing data, which really converted, you know, converted biology and speciation in the same way that language is evolve. You could look at it that way the language of DNA is it actually made tons of snacks and strengthen the theory of evolution so much. So and before you go over this just a theory so is the atomic theory does the gravitational Theory Theory send a biology and theories in science a very large group of evidentiary facts come together to say the same thing. So it's not, you know, like if you don't get when you leave your car at a bar.  I remember it is you have a theory as to where you parked at. That's a different use of the word theory. Okay. So anyway the thing about the evolution of the human species we involved in conditions where there was very little salt, you know, the African Savannah not the seaside not the ocean where there is a lot of salt even back then, you know, and we are incredibly good organisms that retaining any amounts of salt. We are graded that because we didn't have much in our diets. Okay, and we actually have quite a taste for some because it's super valuable. Remember that sodium high on the outside loan inside passing high in the inside is absolutely critical and one thing is kind of beautiful. I don't know if you know this at the osmel at the osmolarity of sodium in blood is exactly the same as sea Waters. That's probably  Disston Heritage in biology. I think it's so cool that they osmolality deep deep deep. So the problem is that salt has a couple really great things aspects that are used in the food supply. Number one. It was realized over two or three hundred years ago that's called is a great way to preserve food. If you take meat in a salted meat beef jerky, all that sucks the water out and so he can last for years and shipping and transport and that's one thing so also does great things to the properties of food when it's at it. Most importantly maybe salt nics food taste better.  Fort Lee Fort Lee we get used to salt and our desire to eat it ramps up as we take more of it. So the average American or the average dose say industrialized diet person can withstand or even enjoy salt levels that are much higher than people who aren't you?  realtor in okay  The it adds up to the fact that we are all almost eating way too much salt and sodium sodium sodium sodium which is an absolutely essential that you know, we evolved what are those because it's so important but because it is incredibly useful in the food supply for flavor for making people Thursday making people enjoy food. I can eat more it is incredibly difficult balance. Okay, and what I would like you to do this isn't right goddamn already a bad day or only a few minutes into it.  Go next time you look at a food label. Like, you know, that's the one of the great things about the American or even now the global food experience. Is that because people pushed back a little the ingredients are pretty well reports. See how much sodium is in the you know, I been as you get older it becomes more and more important and not to not eat the sodium. Okay. So this is the usual usual and take for an average person in about three three grams per day. That's about double the allowable the suggested amount. Okay. So here's some sodium numbers. Okay. This is the adequate intake for these different age groups. Remember adequate intakes for the Moor science you ones that are like parsley out to different age groups and genders and all that stuff still 1005.  What's 1.5. / 0.3 grams? I'm frightening Lee close to this cat it. I'm in this category, but way in the end I'm way in this end of it 1300 bad news. I can tell you that. I need a lot more sodium than that when I'm when I'm not being cool about it. Although I will say this my wonderful spouse not only has bought how not to die and read the whole thing, but she is and I'm eating a lot less salt and everywhere. I turn their seeds and berries and oranges and shit that I don't like everywhere. I'm I'm actually growing to like it, but I'm definitely  You know what? I told the exercise class. I really like that because it sort of validates my habit. So I run marathons and half-marathons in this class cuz I have the worst possible freaking nutrition. I'm like, oh my God opposite of validating but you know, we all need they say the humiliation is the fastest route to humility. Okay, so I'm getting there quickly. All right upper intake is 2300 mg daily values of this dietary supplement is year of the dietary guidelines for Americans to surround 2.3 the American Heart Association who thinks a lot about this in terms of the health benefits says we should be eating like 1500 mg. So a lot less than my people normally.  Enormous. So this is actually from a New England Journal of Medicine review. I don't have a look at it. But the thing about salt is it's absolutely clear. It's absolutely clear that salt is correlated with and causes high blood pressure. And the more you consume the higher risk You Are by blood pressure and one of the interesting thing is it's been done is they've taken American statistics in America United States. No blood pressure over you no 140 over at let me see what it is. It's 140 over 90, which is a dice systolic and diastolic pressures is a very large fraction of the population and many people have in there are even diagnosed as they don't go to their physician. If you go to countries that are eating more likes  I don't have a lot of salt in the diet for reasons. I don't show you nobody has high blood pressure. Like it's incredibly having an industrialized food supply. It's super important for all the reasons. I told you good food properties better preservation really good tendency to eat. Do you realize that they put sodium in soda pop in in in carbonated beverages because it makes you thirsty Morgan's directly that are now being concerned. So sodium is just incredibly important but incredibly bad for us in high amounts and because we are currently home to find and want sodium because we used to not have any of it around putting a lot of in the food supply is be guaranteed way to make us eat more of it too much of it and a big problem the same.  You know, she used to be the average person would eat. I don't know a pound of sugar a year if they were lucky, you know, if they were asked to it every year like a to see if it's an unprecedented challenge to the carefully honed evolutionary metabolism that we can have this picture. So there's actually a lot of bad effects of sodium. Okay, so sodium and hypertension is Alton big sugar, but there are very large industrial concerns that go to Great Lengths to modify and limit restrictions and two and two to diminish the importance of the science that is overwhelmingly telling us that these things are a problem. So it's it's worth thinking about that at least but at least an understanding  But there is a multibillion-dollar system in play. It involves not only making things that are delicious and marketing them with Incredible aggression. But also making sure that laws are passed and regulations are passed it alter the tendency that they can affect the effect affect the ability of us to know what's going on in to make choices that are best for us. It's just it's no question about that came out a little video later so I can spray day and that's actually in a teaspoon of salt so you if you're like me some people even grab the salt shaker before they taste the food and Henry Ford in of the industrialist who invented the production line filled our country with cars more cars than you could ever. Imagine used to not hire someone if they can do a meal.  Urinary not evaluated. This is an apocryphal tale. Maybe that's something Henry Ford some pizza hypertension high blood pressure 140 over 90. That's not a super high blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease Strokes kidney disease This Is Us from Nigel know I don't have high blood pressure. That's incredible 30% of u.s. Adults have blood pressure over 140. And so 50% of people with high blood pressure health condition under control. So only 50% or controlling it and they control it usually with things like, you know, the kind of Pasadena directions that we get used to it cuz we're cars and Physicians are mechanics. We get broken. We roll into a position to go fix me, you know, there isn't a lot of proactive advice going on and that's changing you're going to  Okay, so the risk factors for high hypertension that sells for high blood pressure hypertension is high salt intake obesity in a jam these things all play off of each other. Okay. So here's here's some interesting data from 2011/2012 to see a specific and adjusted prevalence of hypertension in the United States and adults aged 18 and over. So here's overall 29% Like I said, it breaks down pretty evenly to gender. Okay, then a just really drastic. So you guys are cool keep eating that salt but 4259 it starts going way up and people in my age bracket is really high, you know, because it's cumulative effects and probably there's other effects of obesity in and just aging makes us more sensitive that thing so it is it is a real thing. Okay. Here's the thing that amazes me this is salt considered sodium consumption in the US. So this is consumption recommended for people.  This is the American Heart Association recommend, you know acceptable intake. This is the upper limit 1999 says every year, you know, this is for consumption of salt. So just it never changes its way up there. Okay, and this is happened in the last like 20 or 30 years. Okay. So this is good news and bad news. The good news is that there is new guidelines for high blood pressure because it's such a problem. And yes, I used to be that it was rare. And so you wouldn't see it a lot.  Be a medical institutions are now deciding that high blood pressure will be scored is 130 over 80 possibly so that people can get you know put in The Matrix in a sense like you now have high blood pressure. So if your borderline if you're told you have high blood pressure, at least you'll do something about it the trouble of this also, is it creates if you if you want to be cynical about it, it creates a pre-existing condition in are you going to the doctor's office your one-thirty over eighty that used to be? Okay. Now you going to be a HMO you see that's a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure and there's a whole world of that being a problem. If you are already sick getting insured for it is difficult at least for now at this point. So this means tens of millions more Americans will meet the criteria for high blood pressure. The number of men age 45. Bush will trip. So this small change from 14130 will triple the number of men with high blood pressure and the prevalence among women lesson 45 with double meaning a lot of people are right on the edge anyways, and there is pushing the edge over.  For both good and dubious reasons. So where does all this sodium come from? I mean that kind of kind of get the idea that we didn't used to eat a lot of sodium in yet. We've been basically the same biological animals for a hundred thousand years a damn long time to learn how to build weapons, but we're pretty much the same people. Hey, I have an idea. So where does it come from all over from processed food? It is all from processed food and the two main sources of processed food are manufactured groceries and restaurants and this is just a fact. Okay, so a maybe if you watch your weight, you know, if you're if you're a runner you watch your critical issue in performance is the way you're carrying bicycling last running very much. So so I weigh myself every single day to a tenth of a pound just because of the running thing someday. I hope to throw that away.  But I do and what I notice if you eat in a restaurant even counting calories and be careful at least an extra half pound beyond what you expected maybe a pound the next day it'll go away but it's all salt cuz you can take the amount of salt in a small number of grams and then you know deluded into the millimolar of the blood grocery convenience stores. Jesus is most of the sodium in that comes in here. There's restaurants and fast food show a single slice of pizza a single slice of pizza is more salt that you need in a whole day at the highest limit and who is one slice of pizza. Come on. Let's get real and then it says other restaurants fast-food restaurants other restaurants in his other sources, like vending machines. This is still manufacture the stuff. So it is all from the industrialized food supply.  Okay, so here's some nice exam. This is like a little chart that Nigel put together is so if you just look at regular meet, you know, this is like need a fresh meat from a farm from from a cow or something. Nothing's happened to it is sodium levels about 15 mg per unit. I think it's per gram. I'm not sure per pound and then potassium levels 300 mg the same amount over a gram of sauce can the same amount so it's like this is a to increase here and tomato tomato has 10 mg of sodium per unit kisses per pound and a higher level of potassium tomato sauce has has 30 times as much potassium sodium in it and hardly any potassium. So it's quite clear that these processing steps.  Are doing this right here is actually a fancy chart from your book that has some really wonderful and end very telling things. I mean, this actually is is is put the fear of process in me. This is a cup of uncooked rice in a cup of uncooked rice. Rice-A-Roni. 387 grams is half the salt you need for a whole day from nothing from the rice that you just from cook at home. Here's one small baked potato 10 mg of salt 1 cup of au gratin potatoes 700 in a you get the point. Okay. So what are the good news is if you cook food at home.  Are people who confronted him do not add nearly as much salt and restaurant food is designed for us to eat it fast and eat a lot of it and really liked it. Like that's you know, and it's worth mentioning. I used to work in the Food Services industry and the profit margin of a restaurant, I guess with the profit margin of a restaurant is you are you working this but  top 1% arrested so he just suggested 12% which I used to work at this fantastic play some Ziggy Herman's Deli in Ann Ann Arbor, Michigan amazing Food Emporium. They've been on Oprah and stuff is amazing. I was early employee there. I learned a lot and they started their accounting system while I was there and you have to get me the reason you need an accounting system in restaurants, cuz the profit margin so small they had suddenly they noticed their profit was disappearing like 200 employees and their profit was disappearing doing business and they finally hired a detective one person was stealing a bag of groceries every night, you know just took a bag of groceries out. He closed the place and they hired detective who discovered that's how difficult it is to run.  Can you play just very hard? Okay, so so getting restaurants to be for the food to be really delicious that use every possible way to do it and I'm a huge fan arrested in restaurant food is great, but it is great because of probably many of the wrong reason so home cooked food is a way to go in this is actually a nice example. This is you know, sometimes home cook and this is you know, heavily processed food and there are many are contenders. It is a book that can teach you about the the restaurant food processors called fast food nation, and this is an old book but it's still a very important book about the restaurant food supply in and how it's affected our entire food economy not just restaurant, but every aspect of food, so there's actually some really interesting dietary Solutions. So we're going to watch another video. It's going to be fun. This is our old friend. Dr. Michael Greger how not to die. I'll put the lights.  Can look at its Tuesday. We're still awake. I hope this works.  What was that?  Recent article in the journal meet scientific knowledge of the population receives a meat is a food that is detrimental to their health because of studies Association me consult with heart disease and cancer for healthy food Alternatives as a means to maintain good health. So this represents a good opportunity to develop some new product. Natural Foods could be added to meet to reach those health or injured consumers by boosting antioxidant levels, for example food, like flax seeds and tomatoes are healthy associated with reduced risk possibly making flexing tomato Burgers. They figure they can produce such a trident taken less sugar. Somehow lured. When did these are just a cut out the middle Pig and eat flax seeds ourselves.  Flax seeds have been described as a miraculous defense against some critical maladies a fan of flax but this in Translation, but then I saw this guy and realized maybe that title is not too far off.  rarely, do we see a doctor a study of this caliber perspective double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial that isn't a nutrition study for drugs at easing until the end of the study neither the researchers nor the patient has any idea which is which double lined ground flaxseed and a half of people's diets without them knowing they created these various blacks or Placebo containing foods and even had a secret until 6 months later when they broke the code to see who a twitch  Tested on hypertension because having a systolic blood pressure over 115. That's the top number may be the single most important determinant for death in the world today are the people blood pressure pills and don't stay hypertensive 6 months later. But those who are unknowingly eating ground flax seeds everyday drop their systolic blood pressure about 10 points and they're about seven point that might not sound like a lot but it dropped like that could cut stroke risk 46% heart disease 29% and that 10-point dropping the top number could have a similar pic of strokes and heart attacks. And for those that started out over 140. They got a 15.0 and summary flaxseed induced one of the most potent.  What's a hypertensive effect ever achieved by dietary intervention? In other words the magnitude of this decrease in blood pressure demonstrate by dietary flaxseed better than any other nutritional interventions in comparable too many drugs, which can have serious side effects and they're not exaggerating about the flats dropped stock up the 15 and 7 compared that too powerful and Hip-Hop pressure is 5 and 2 calcium channel blockers like Norvasc and cardizem 8 3/2 of what the flax could do and side effects include  Compare this list to that of the side effect of flax seeds. It's Pleasant nutty flavor.  During the six-month trial they were strokes and heart attacks in both groups. Even if the flax seeds can cut risk in half though. Any avoidable risk is unacceptable. Well isn't high blood pressure just inevitable as we get older but not for everyone people who eat more plant-based diets or keep their salt intake low enough 10 not to exhibit any change of blood pressure with advancing age. So no flax is great, but always better to prevent the disease in the first place.  Alright. Thank you, Michael.  So, you know, there's a lot to unpack that I think is worth thinking about and I think we'll maybe make me quiz gushing this week about some of these issues because there's interest in corporate issues his desire to subvert changing. There's this idea that you know, how do you do a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study with food? That's a huge problem so that some of it there's actually a lot of crazy things about this Michael Greger guy is first of all video has about 15 scientific references in which just is amazingly dense. So that's cool II he's he's made over a thousand of these videos, so I don't know what he's eating, but I would like a quarter dose of it absolutely amazing even knew you'd appreciate that very nice view of sort of some of the  Is there a problem?  Okay, good. I wish I was off it was in a PowerPoint to talk about a few other minerals and then we're going to switch gears and talk about obesity in the Obesity crisis that is that is part of an entire world at food food food Matrix. So we talked about some major minerals and want to talk about some minor ones mostly iron and iodine and zinc. Okay. So some of these are these are small number Mineral small amounts usually tip about to take him in the microgram quantities, but they're unbelievably important and their deficiencies are unbelieving partner toxicities are important to okay. So there is really many many parts of the world where there's a micronutrient deficiencies that are that are very obvious. So what are the sort of unfortunate things is when we think about how we often think about we think about local health and wellness and there's a whole Global aspect to health and wellness that  Much harder for people to generate interest in especially if they're trying to make money, which is totally it's totally valid to make a living. There's nothing wrong with me. But there are it's interesting to remember that we are both part of a nation and a civilization and sort of the interesting challenges to combine those things in a way that everyone is happy with. Okay. So this is a is it in terms of the iron deficiency in vitamin A and iron deficiency and iodine and vitamin A deficiencies are all quite prevalent in many parts of the world. Have you noticed we and other industrialized countries are exonerated from these potatoes efficiencies. I didn't go by the public health level you can still find people with these kind of deficiency smoke a little bit and there's really don't you know, there's two ways that we get our in his heme iron that's iron is bound to this beautiful hemoglobin or myoglobin you've talked about so he missed the cofactor. This is for you know this for  A chelating cofactor that holds iron + 2 and its place okay here before 4 and cofactor that's in part of both myoglobin and hemoglobin that is used to carry oxygen makes basically iron a good carrier boxygen. And so one way we can do it when we need any be like muscle tissue or liver anything like that. We did a lot of heme iron. Okay, and then is non-heme or mineral iron mineral iron is mineral iron, and that's really just  Iron, that's free as an ion and it's either + 2 or + 3 ferrous or ferric that you learned about chemistry. So the predominant form in plants is is is mineral in the predominant form and animals is he and heme iron is easier to absorb what meats are a much better source of iron at least it's because they're easier to absorb in there also have a very high concentration. That doesn't mean you can't get iron from plant sources are other sources. You just have to be a little midget on Sony the troubled mineral and is only two to 10% of its absorbed and when the guys so strongly influenced by several factors. So what day of things are promote mineral iron absorption, so gastric acid from parietal cells as useful so that helps a side was Asian vitamin C actually improves iron Sergeant kazookeylele sit and converts it to iron to which is the performance of Sword. So there's also things that inhibit  Acid tannins you keep mentioning. These beasts are natural chelating molecules and grab the iron and don't let it come in Solo gastric acid tannins in tea and coffee to drink coffee low gastric acid in some antacids also can compete so you probably learned about this in your physiology or cell biology class which Boheme and mineral iron get into the cell. So the first thing that happens it gets trapped in the mucosal cells of the intestine and it's bound to a protein called ferritin ferritin is a carrier protein.  Berrington hangs onto iron iron is actually not a good thing to have floating freely inside cells. It does all sorts of chemistry. It's a very chemically I has all those cool D orbitals. I can get can go plus 3 or plus to do electron exchange. Give me an oxidizing agent. It is moved on to a molecule called transferrin and Trans Am I going to go crazy here transfer?  Farron Addison and gets taken up by the liver be taken up by muscles to for myoglobin. It can be incorporated into bone. Okay and end the bone marrow is where you make blood cells or hemoglobin to carry oxygen. So there's a whole. Okay, and this is actually just some detail. This will be on the slides that you download that talks about the detailed aspects of this and I will give you a little summary of it, you know about how this all works. All right, and iron absorption of closest is in one of the ear mucosal cells is he can enter the cells through a transporter? Okay, and the neck is broken down and iron ii is with put on the ferritin. Okay. So iron 3 can also be converted to Iron II by brush border enzymes and iron to connect to the cells are also okay, then it  Can be moved by a transporter called ferroportin into the the fluid on the other side of the basolateral cross the basolateral membrane and it can be put into transferrin Works carried around so that's basically how that goes. This actually describe some of the details there, but the bottom line, you know, this is pretty detail musical for study, but the bottom line is Sears in word is iron is taken up by absorptive cells in the duodenum or duodenum. It binds to ferritin which is a storage proteins transported out of the absorptive cells by ferroportin. This is transporter Arrow, Porton.  I'm just having my troubles today Arrow Porton.  and then it moves into the  it's bound to transferring its that's Construction in transparent travels in the blood deliver. Another organs were taken it by transferring receptor. So there's actually a specific cell surface receptor. People say crazy making people calling this transferrin receptor. That's when is the trans  Baron I went lower case they're sorry your scepter. I'll go back to larger case. I apologize. I went lowercase On You by shift key I went down. Okay, so that didn't live can also be stored is iron ferritin complexes in liver is an incredibly rich source of iron despite. It being gross to eat. I take that back. So what are the functions of iron in this is something you probably could Cobble together, you know this it's oxygen carbon dioxide transport and hemoglobin major myoglobin is oxygen uptake and we've done this beautiful curves are hemoglobin myoglobin have different oxygen binding curve help me move the oxygen from the blood into the muscle important in metabolism all of the cytochrome that whole electron transport chain is all Iron and and several of the Krebs cycle enzymes including a connotation are all Iron dependent enzyme. So this just has lots of different functions that are very important part for what we talked about.  Is the cytochrome p450 system is on this detoxification system that sits in the liver and it gets first shot at all the drugs and all the molecules and enter through the through the hepatic portal vein and iron is a critical part of the biochemistry of a cytochrome. That's why it's called cytochrome because they're colored because iron gives them those colors right to dislike. You have cytochrome Xin in a mitochondria the cytochrome enzymes in liver RR iron-containing. I was going to use that iron chemistry. Okay. So the iron requirements women are greater than men because of the Lost Tomb Astroglide, even if the reason on a blood loss through blood donation act will diminish iron so women have to have to approve premenopausal women have to think about that. So the RDA for men is a 8mg re-cement a lot and women is about 18 / 2.  Is quite a lot. So the average intake for women is lower than what they should be taking in Traverse from that has higher which is kind of interesting and I don't know what the socio-cultural reasons for it is, you know, I grew up thinking that everyone is correctly nourished. It was just a sort of this Asylum if maybe cuz I was a baby boomer 1954. I was born like everyone our country is everyone successfully there's no need to worry about nourishment. And that's just way too simple things like this that lack of subtlety in that Benning. Everything is that all is okay? It's not a service to anyone. So we're debunking that meth. Okay. So iron deficiency. Anemia is the major thing that happens and it develops gradually. So the first stage is depleting iron storage pool. So she have a lot of iron story Fulton the liver and other tissues away gradually deplete and then the advanced stages you actually get low blow.  Hemoglobin level, so you actually see and inability to transport oxygen so as iron drops for a while, but hemoglobin hematocrit is preserved. The thing about the iron base. Anemia can be caused by any number of things is the boat intake from the diet. If it's not provided or some difficulty in mechanism poor absorption of iron 350. There are some sort of disease state or you know, what genetic predisposition do they have some kind of internal bleeding and all the last come is there blood in your stool will do you have any discomfort and said there's no cuz this can really happen. So it's a it's an indication of that. Okay. So the what are the sources of iron what turns out the lowly Clan the lowly Clan is actually if you need to  Chart showing this is how to get 18 mg of iron and so plans 2.3 liver to deliver is red meat still bit less. You need a little bit more pumpkin seeds. Not that we need a whole cup to equal that that's a lot of pumpkin seeds cashews and cashews like her delicious, but careful lot of calories cooked white beans. So, you know, you can see it goes down in and one of the challenges is plant-based sources it are more challenging. So one of the things about iron toxicity is a real thing. Okay. So the upper limit is only 45 miles per day. So this is one of those upper limits. It's not far from the amount that you should be taking at 12:18. So it's not it's not, you know, some some nutrients we talked about you can just take them till the cows come home and you're just, you know, the major side effect is loss of money. It's very very bad.  Gastric distress and also is a catalyst for free radical. So this is a very famous reaction called the Fenton reaction is not an enzymatic reaction to Pure chemical reaction. Which iron can cause hydrogen peroxide h202 become this very nasty hydrogen radical. He's needs to IAH. And hm ioh - H. Is a very reactive oxidative damage is a real problem. So iron toxicity can cause so one of the very sad cases is there are chewable iron supplements. Like if you go to the drugstore, you can get pretty much any nutrient is a sweet including weed now, I guess he was little bears. The bears are like so high they can't even read their own label.  No, go ahead. I don't care but the toxicity can be bad enough that these these chewable iron supplements are tasty and sweet and if a child finds it only takes about 200 mg to to be lethal. So this is something that they give us some of these supplements that are tasty and find like those freaking Tom's, you know, that's not a problem. But iron is so I'm to iron homeostasis is you know, what is is actually pretty elaborate. I don't know what that why is there so it's a I think you know what it's supposed to be in increases in intestine intestine absorbs sells iron Trap by Faron to get slept off cells die. So iron trap if body iron is low ferritin levels. We do so iron gets through. Okay, so  So ferritin is adjusted if if we have to hire iron, there's there's physiology president increase the amount of ferritin to hold on to it is but I need to go and then there's natural remember that the intestinal wall turned over every few days. And so that's when will you store the iron in a place where it's going to get turned over on this also a hormone called hepcidin. It's a peptide hormone from liver that they put in the blood and when and have side and it increases the internalization and degradation in ferroportin. So when iron is high have siding blocks iron release from absorptive cells in decreases, you know, it's transported into the eye transparent producing areas. So have side and also released during infection to reduce blood iron. So so this is kind of cool is Hep siding is used to deprive pathogens of iron, but that's one reason that you can get in chronic infection. You can have anemia somebody has a chronic infection is constantly producing extra herbicide in one of the ways though present is with a infection pointer a lot of texts.  No wonder Melissa got sick. So I mean Laura so there's actually a disease called Hema hemochromatosis that is in Iron disorder that involves very high levels of blood iron and I actually have a friend. He was one of my chemistry professors and I was in college and he's not a pretty old guy but we've kept in touch and I like the professor's who who who were special in my life. I've made a point of keeping in touch with them and they me and I he was Mike Evans one of my customers has hemochromatosis and he has to be very careful about it. So it's the most common cause of iron toxicity in it. So, it's a genetic disorder. It's actually a predisposition out to each have excess iron uptake in storage and it is predictive disease disrupt Stepside and function. So it sits there is a chronic hyper off Eric illness. So untreated, it causes liver disease and heart failure and the treatment involves blood removal just like bloodletting from the Medieval Era but with a little  Ford Focus on why it's happening and chelation circulating the iron. So that's a that's the thing talk about zinc so many of you probably know zinc cuz there's a sort of cultural myth that if you get a cold you should take zinc and then they're does many products like a med or whatever they all have zinc in them. And I Randy actually take a zinc supplement if I feel a cold coming cuz there are some studies pretty legit studies then imply that a cold sore duration will be shorter if you take zinc now, they're meta-analyses that say that probably might not be true. I want my cold to go away and it seems to always work. My cold always goes away. So anyway, so there many enzymes of zinc is required for a ton of different enzymes aldehyde dehydrogenase what we talked about not antidiuretic hormone annoying commonality of Akron Tim Carbonic anhydrase.  Important enzyme involved in oxidative. Oh, yes.  Oh, that's a aldehyde dehydrogenase that we talked about in alcohol metabolism and someone correctly pointed out that it's also the same as antidiuretic hormone a sad convergence. You would think scientist would never run out of acronym cuz 26 letters. So that's 26 to the 3rd power three letter acronyms but nevertheless is sometimes convergence.  Alcohol dehydrogenase. Thank you. ADH.  alcohol dehydrogenase  I had too much alcohol and not enough dehydrogenase, okay?  Thank you.  Yeah, okay that enzyme the one the first enzyme into detoxification or Inn in metabolism alcohol. So it said it's in those involved in normal growth and sexual maturation because there's hundreds of enzymes that use this and soul so important a so this is actually a classic sperm is zinc deficient pigs will starve to death cuz they won't eat anyting right to me and I'm a pig and you can even give them a zinc back. I'll be if you give them food without the think they just won't eat it. Die of malnutrition. So sink is incredibly important taste perception. Also as many as three hundred different enzymes in the body and they have just tons of role of DNA synthesis RNA synthesis heme synthesis bone formation Taste of hugest a ton of different things as think is a very broadly important nutrient and so again, it's like iron  There's no loss of it that's gender-specific. The typical intake is 12 to 13 mg. Not a big deal about 40% of Swords it like other things is inhibited by some of these and phytic acid blocks. It's you know, uptake usually not a problem. So deficiency involves things like slow growth. So sexual maturation a poor taste sensitivity upper limit is 40 mg per day. Okay, so I went and checked I have in my drawer these supplements and zinc picolinate for pickle in a gas into a chelating acid. I bought it if I hold my calls, I foresee no get that many calls, but I went and checked it's 20 mg per pill and I usually take two or three are the trouble is zinc causes actually over gastric symptoms. If you take a zinc pill and you don't have a meal you will get nauseous in about 5 minutes, and I know this cuz I did that control its  Dang, it's a real thing or two of my zinc supplements are so maybe the meta-analysis. I should I should believe. Okay, so there are pros and one of the kind of cool things is so we talked about anti-nutrients is phytic acid oxaloacetate tannins that block the reuptake of ions by Kilian in natural foods that cause increased uptake. So if you get actually better bioavailability of iron and zinc from things entering garlic and onions if the class of molecules called aliens and their they're basically they're just pronutrients  They just improve the bioavailability of some things when you consume vitamin C is a pro nutrient in a sentence for iron cuz it helps up take out. So these things all enter play with each other remembering thousands of phytochemicals in an average plant me like a salad. It's sort of daunting an amazing how much interplay there could be? Okay. So the last one we're going to talk about his iodine. And if you're watching the HBO special Chernobyl, which is pretty amazing, you know, they're all grabbing iodine pills because the product of one of those plutonium breeder reactors is radioactive iodine. They can take show iodine is actually heading credibly important role in production of thyroid hormones is actually great pictures of big purple balls on the big purple balls are on our iodine. So this is just the structure of tetra Ida Ida, thyronine for thyroid and triiodothyronine. Those are the two major active thyroid hormones that we produce in her thyroid gland  Above and you can see they have tons of iodine in them. And that is the major use of iodine in the in the human is production of and continuous generation of these T4 and T3 hormone Center, as you know, super important role a metabolic rate and the kind of things that we talked about in energy metabolism will talk more about that. So heat level of thyroid activity controls your basal metabolic rate your body temperature, you know, when a lot of other effects that we feel from so it turns out that is if you don't have enough iodine you have a very elaborate endocrine feedback system that says we don't have enough thyrotropin releasing hormone thyroid stimulating hormone, and then and this TSH and it makes you produce more.  T4 and T3 which is great, and there's a constant feedback balance. But if you don't have any idea what happens is this accent just keeps trying and trying and trying and a thyroid gets larger and larger in you get what's called a goiter. So this is actually this picture you can see when you get the print out, but see that very faint, but if I lie now, hold on.  See see that butterfly pattern there. That's the normal thyroid size and then quit her can be quite big. So this actually to Mason Creek this is from a medical illustration in the 19 hundreds of a woman who had what's called a class 3 greater and this is simply from from a TSH continuously operating to make the the side were going to go bigger and bigger without production of thyroid hormone. So and this can happen interested if you if you Google go later and look at images you will see unbelievable pictures of people with absolutely massive thyroid goiters. They're not as long as you're not producing a lot of thyroid directly not dangerous. There just can be quite large can't sell the iron requirements. One of the great things. Is that for once  Seaweed wins and one of the very richest sources of iodine in the world is seaweed. So you get that lovely seaweed in your Japanese food tastes really great and tangy and you get lots of iron is because the ocean has lots of iodine and sea salt has iodine in it. I know they're very popular source of iodine is iodized salt all the boxes of salt you buy at the store and part of this as you know, babe salt manufacturers like to push the idea that you need to sign in and all of his salt that we talked about is problematic. So there's better ways to get your ad on Indian lots of salt but these are just some of the different in a ways to get it and it's quite clear that there are a few sources that are really reaching it. Okay and iodized salt a good one. So let me look at some of these questions and then we're going to do a little are you color-blind the pointer ball? I know it's what is the point of all this yellow yet kind of yellow and green but it has a greenish tint from this computer screen.  Hold on. Let me see.  Where is it was pretty yellow here, but on my screen, it's green by Randy new computer fund actually. This is funny. I ran that marathon on Saturday. I didn't Dino age and I was so sue doubt that I left my computer on an airplane when I went to home and I had to go to the airport like midnight. I overcame that spaced-out admits that happened. So anyway, let's see what else we got. I am not colorblind so there  A lot price me how long does it take for iron to be absorbed into the body. Is it different for someone who has anemia me absorbs? It depends if they have anemia cuz they are poor absorption. It can take a long time if they have an iron absorption rate probably jacked up because when irons low a physiological systems try to improve up taking such  Oh, my dad just said flax seeds blood pressure. If it don't happen, if you cook the flaxseed baked it into those muffins for the placebo control. So I think you can bake with it. I don't know you have to ask Dad for more detail doctor. He says you're full of shit in terms of iron intake chart with a widow claim then be much would a clan be much better than a cup of pumpkin seeds in suppose you there in minerals on both that the clan is really rich. You don't have to eat a cup of Clans on the clams are kind of delicious. If you're from the East Coast like me and you you get in here. So those are both good we should get more of it and it's more mobile.  I've heard too much iron cause of constipation tell me if that's the case. How come high iron intake causes diarrhea. I don't know good question. I'm glad you brought that up. I'm going to look into it. My phone just did something crazy. Hold on. We're back or waxy. We desperately need to text message General.  Where you born before McDonald's founded that is so funny. Yes, I was and I will tell you something when I was in high school. There was a McDonald's in our town actually was in another way to drive to McDonalds burgers or like a buck and we would go and there be a hundred person line. It is one cool new place called McDonald's. So yes, and they were red with white tiles and they look completely different. I hadn't thought of those arches in the billions served in a billions killed. So I like that. Yeah, so I will talk more about that.  Considering the brush border conversion of iron 3 Iron to do people experience digestive disorders also have coincidence. I lower amounts of iron absorbed in prison body. It depends, you know, it's one because if they have for absorption and poor cell function, that could be one of the things that happens, you know.  Why do people get sleepy after eating a heavy meal tryptophan, but I think it's probably just because you have a lot of neural circuits leptin is produced when you when you're not eating and you makes you more active in for foraging and stuff and when you eat their own neural hormones that calm you down and make you digest like after eating is good to relax in this. I think they were behavioral control circuits that are involved with that. Why do people that need me a bruise easily? Well, I think it's because there are there blood clotting system is affected by iron levels also, but I'm not sure that's a good question. Okay. I am a doctor. I'm a fake doctor of a PhD piled high and deep. So that stands for okay. NS is more S&P is piled high and deep. Okay. So what about sodium alternatives?  Yeah, or just what the what most people suggest like dietitians and nutritionists suggest that if you just eat less sodium your palette ships and you become more comfortable lower amounts. There are sodium sentence if you really have a Jones for that, you know that salty flavor, but from what I've heard and I'm kind of learning this the hard way cuz of that is that as you eat less sodium your palate shifts because you even if it's still pretty much the same that is quite comfortable with very low levels of sodium. So it's worth it's an interesting thing to give it a try I say that the upper limits but also absorbed by the body so mighty upper limit activity high sodium is actually very well absorbed. It doesn't like it it it is absorbed pretty well, unfortunately. So the upper limit is Envy upper limit these limits what they're doing when they look at hypertension is comparing how much people can assume, you know to the physiological and medical Coral it so it's the consumption and the details of absorption or not.  What's an interesting question calcium? Carbonate is 40% calcium by weight. So 7 or 50 mg of calcium carbonate. I think it's 7 or so, maybe 300 milligrams still alive, but not quite as bad. Thank you. I feel better. I can eat for five of those a day. Now. That's a good point cuz it's 7 or 50 mg of calcium carbonate and calcium. I have a degree in chemistry. So they had invented calcium back then. Okay. So let's stop now. Let's do a little click in just a little bit and then we'll start talking about obesity.  How to say do we have clickers today?  Yes.  Is it going to be very fun?  Okay ready?  How many pieces of whole fruit do you eat a day typically just roughly.  How many pieces of all fruit no damn fruit one piece today?  Those who people are leaving for the restroom halfway through class, right? All right.  hair we go  turn it up.  All right.  Let's see.  Some people leave no damn fruit.  But it's actually very good to eat a couple pieces of fruit a day. It is a great source of fiber. It is a much gentler source of sugar if you like sugar if it's you know, what is a lower glycemic index and all sorts of wonderful phytochemicals in Fruit. I can't believe I'm actually saying that but cuz I'm like a Hostess Twinkies guy. So but it's true. I've started eating. I'm actually now in this category. I am proud to say I'm a see and some people need a shitload of root amazing and that's literally what it is.  I drink milk.  never  once a week twice a week every day like a calf.  This way to the other I don't even need a cup.  I don't need a cup.  Oh, sorry.  Just milk regular milk.  Not like creamer drinking a glass of milk.  Not splashing it in your Starbucks with room.  Hey, what do we got?  Are there some calves? Alright? Okay few more. Come on. Let's get this extra clicker out of your backpack.  Your frat brother will appreciate it. Okay.  boom  never  once a week twice a week. Wow, there's some serious milk heads here. Alright, that's cool.  I suggest go to nutritionfacts.org. This is the Thousand web the Thousand video web page of that crazy Michael over there were looking at nutrition.  facts  . Org  and watch some of his things about milk, very interesting milk is very heavy as many good nutritional properties and it has some problems to not a problem for young people have really ripping metabolism. So you're all good. You're all good.  if I was asked to watch a video prior to discussion section  I would really like to not watch it.  50/50 chance I would watch that shit like Game of Thrones. Okay, so which is it?  Which is it? I knew watch that ass that stuff like Game of Thrones, which is it.  All right. I'm going to cut off cuz I want to go I want to go to the Obesity thing. Okay?  Let's see how we're doing.  Don't you ever listen to thing you go? I would own all likely not watch it. You're describing yourself. Negatively. You're setting a low bar for yourself. You're doing The Limbo Dance under the bar of your own abilities. Shoot High my friends shoot. I these people at least have hope they might  at least people need to get a life now. I'm getting okay, it's all awesome. It's just that there's some really fun discussions that could be had from watching some of these videos, but if you don't watch and your discussion section mate does than they're carrying your weight?  You better bring him some fruit. Okay, so, you know, that's the whole idea. Okay. I just want to know that.  They were going to talk about obesity and eventually obesity in nutrition. And I know that this is something you hear a lot in biomedical science class or so, maybe a little of this is review. But some of these numbers are just incredible to me anything to realize is that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic. Now, this does not have been very difficult things about the Obesity situation is it is very very easy to inadvertently shame or make people feel bad for obese and it is very easy to slip and I used to say one of my classes at obesity is the last hate crime. I think that's changed now with her current political but but it is very very easy for otherwise good nice friendly people to inadvertently Akshay make fun of belittle marginalized people who have extra weight that makes him uncomfortable or unhealthy. So the trick is to understand in a way that's  100 metal in neutral and one of the interesting movement is happening nutrition and fitness is trying to figure out ways to take people of a certain body mass and make their life is good as possible without demanding. They lose some people cannot easily lose weight is very hard to do and if you think it's easy to do go to lose 10 lb in come tell me how hard that was before you say I have heard many people especially people who aren't medical scientist is all those people that would be stationed. Just go to the gym more and eat less do that. It is very very difficult and importantly we don't know everything about body mass what controls it is foolish to think we'd get that, you know, however, there is one aspect of obesity in body mass. It is definitely massively impacted by the current food supply and that is that is the tendency of our country and our world to be getting massively.  Morbidly obese in a way that's physically problematic for one's Health. Okay, but they're so we will talk about that. So are useful public health tool and its only 9 is called the body mass index index is a single number. So it's a very it's very convenient to use cuz it's easy to calculate.  And you can right this second Google body mass index calculator and you'll find 20 of them on Google and basically what it does is it takes your weight and your height and Pleasanton farmer's weight divided by height in inches squared times this parameter 703 and that's your body mass index. And so this is actually the levels of it. So these numbers are typically between like 17 18 and 40. Okay, and then you can classify this on this is an incredibly useful Public Health number meaning it's easy to calculate you don't need a lot of information but it's not information. That's okay. But with that in mind, it's a very useful first indicator of the possibility of having too much body mass too much adiposity and the subsequent Health difficulties in associate with that. This is a little chart. Don't freak out before you freak out. I know you're down to your height and weight.  Good BMI, before you do that you have to understand it. BMI does not taking your cat in anyway body composition that we can be very different between different people. I've had students show these charts. And as soon as it is worth understanding though where one stands in the scale cuz when can start taking some action if they want to not being so let's see here is an end. It's another thing thing to realize our body mass index is if you take a certain height hears me, I'm very diminutive. So I used to be here but I got so old that I shrank. This is true. This is true. I am sad to say but I used to be around here. Now. I'm just a withered little Husker the mayonnaise to be and so but look at this would be interested in is the healthy range.  118 lb to 145 so there's a very broad range of Weights in a given range of body mass. Index to the point being that for someone to go from here to obese is quite a lot of weight gain and that partially cuz it's a public health measure. It has to incorporate a lot of different body types. Okay. And so this is actually a useful little shark does a million of these. So this is just sort of a silhouette picture of what roughly it looks like, you know for different body mess. So this is probably a bit underweight the lesson 18. And again, this is completely dependent upon body composition. This is that range of people cheers up over weight between 25 and 29 here Sobeys 30 and up and our president is actually at 29. So he's not obese. All that golf is keeping him slim Kentucky Fried Chicken.  So there we go. That's a good thing. But this is actually the useful thing to remember is fairies remembers it as I've heard Professor Israel against body mass. Index II terrible thing. It's not it's not a very precise not a very nuanced thing. It's a single number that helps people understand where they might like 30. They probably will want to examine you say will let's see what that's about. Are you a bodybuilder. Do you have a lot of adiposity? Haven't you any problems like this in your Family Eye Center Centrics two people with the same body mass index. This would be a person with enormous amount of muscle and fat and is the same person same height same mass and there, you know, their composition is most of this is why BMI  Saturated fatty acid. Okay. So I just discovered this website Korg sort of the things you want to develop some Savvy about in your Neo scholarship is what a website's got three letter code means if it's got cam they're probably trying to sell you something you want to be better than me. You can't get a good information, but you have to be a little wary. Org is often an organization is trying to get information on this actually state of obesity comes out of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which is a Medical Foundation Basin Rutgers University. So it's pretty legit in terms of being about you know of evidence based on information and not trying to push an agenda. Okay, so they actually just analyzed the Obesity up levels of obesity problem in different states, OK and so they're very building obesity is the percentage of all that it's in a given State who are classified as obese where Abby's is mine.  A BMI of 30 or greater so he can go back to that. Try to see where would I be without and a BMI of 30 is pretty substantial body mass to know who knows something bad's going on. I ran I think this thing ran out of juice.  No, it didn't. Okay, so they have this is an amazing website to check I suggest to go look at its full of amazing data. And so this has every single state characterized in 2017 some very recent data about the different states and then rank them. So the worst the most obese country is West Virginia and number 48, California. Okay, but I want to know something. So let's take them. They're one of the very best states in terms of obesity statistics and see how that breaks down the West Virginia 38% of the adults have a BMI of 30 or above which is pretty incredible, California, you know, we're all about Fitness and looking good and getting a Hollywood and be discovered 25% of the people have a BMI over 30 million people in California is your children between two and four 16% Okay. So this or these are these are buried  For this it is a California obesity rates. This is day. One of the best states in the in the union gradually climate seems he provide telling a little is plateauing about it any worse. So then this is a breaking out by age. Okay. This is a ethnicity are some interesting features of that that are part of a whole other conversation gender. Okay. So the reason this is important is because these are the obesity-related number so there are many syndromes are going to talk about this in the next lecture that connect to obesity that are enhanced by I am more likely, you know, given that there are other genetic factors and socio-cultural mean behavioral factors to but diabetes is also much higher. So it's 10% of the Paw.  Malaysian 10% of the population has Type 2 diabetes that is a crap load of people and he projected the current value of a 2010 with 2600000 people. That's a lot of diabetes. That's a lot of insulin. That's a lot of Medical Care hypertension. 28.4% de like I said 30 in California. One of the lowest lenses is 6 million + people with hypertension. Okay, and  So it's probably even if it worsens is a spinal end with adult Russell and we'll be done with this is one of the things you can notice if you look closely this is 7 states of obesity rates of 35% or higher everyone's lower and yet the national bcraiders 37.7 do they not know how to use your calculator? And the reason is it the state obesity rates are collected by the by the behavioral risk factor surveillance system this from the CDC that's done by self-reporting it ask you. How much do you weigh? You know what you know, what what is your what is your height and all that and research is the respondents tend to overestimate their height underestimate their weight, especially if they're on match.com since he in fact one study found that due to this, but I'm going to be FRS May underestimate.  National health and nutrition examination survey, which is a a National Institute of Health one. Does it by actually using physician exam. So they take data from people who walked into a doctor's office. So that's more accurate. So the sad thing is it that state date of it's already pretty disturbing the lowest one Aloha State's the country is 25% people with that BMI of over 30, you know, and and higher that's an under estimate probably so that's where we stand and it's been priest with them both both continue this on Thursday. Don't eat a lot of salt. "
