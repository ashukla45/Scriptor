    "Full Transcript": "All right, welcome back.  So you had a few quick care housekeeping announcements wine if this looks familiar was left in the discussion sections.  Last evening. So if this is yours is water bottle of please feel free to get it. If not, we'll leave it here and hopefully somebody will be able to find it good thing is that I wanted to apologize. I forgot to introduce myself. So I'm a professor Crawford. You probably knew that but I thought it would do it for me. So I actually Emeritus Professor which means retired fancy name for retired professor and filling in today last Tuesday and today for should be back next Tuesday. Okay.  So we can continue the discussion on lipids and I came across this video that just was released yesterday. And since it involved some ass an aspect of recovered yesterday. I thought I would bring it up for one from my Favorites site as well as give some interesting information. So if your call last Tuesday, just two days ago. I talked about the discovery a little bit history of discovery of essential fatty acids, which was casted make a 6in alpha-linolenic which was in omega-3 and then talked about how they got the tablet wise. Do you say long Aces and faces into longer polyunsaturated fatty acids are both of these are examples of polyunsaturated fatty acid and the extended to longer chain. They make a 6 Costa Rica Dona. Can they make it three goes to EPA and DHA?  Now the significance of DHA EPA and arachidonic acid is converted into these critical signaling molecules eicosanoids, which are also it in particular ones are thromboxane in which involved in blood clotting prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation as well as protecting the lining of the stomach so we can get the short chain fatty acids from Plants horses with the greens are a great source. Flax is another great source.  However, these longer chains ones which are the precursors For the synthesis of eicosanoids. Either have to be made from the shorter chain ones in our own body, which can be pretty inefficient. They can get as low as one to 2% in the body depending on what's in your diet, or we can get them from her diet, which is a great thing. So the critical one is the EPA and a great source of that is cold water fish so salmon for example, and then Anchovies and sardines, so I talked about all that and then I brought up the issue though. If you want to get this from fish you have to be concerned about the pollutants in fish high in mercury is a big once I give an example of tuna. Well, this video came out yesterday from nutritionfacts.org seen this site know about this site.  Wow, okay, hopefully by the end of this quarter everybody's hand will go up. Let me just put in a little plug for this site. This is after studying nutrition for five decades. This is probably the most hands-down best site I've ever found a nutrition information and the reason is because he has a team of 15 to 20 investigators that comb the medical and scientific literature of thousands of articles. In fact, they said to do over 10,000 articles a year and they put out videos on summarizing these articles that they review in these videos and Lisa written blogs that he does. So it's a fabulous source of information on clinical nutrition of the guy started is Gregory's in MD is devoted his life to this and the other anything. So now he's a great source of information. It's also free.  No bias is no ads. No a sponsor's is all based on hundred by donations. So it's a fabulous sign is a query box. You can put any subject you want any or pull up the video City stamp and all the papers that he covers have citations below the video which goes to the abstracts on the NIH database site to use in grade informational yesterday was on the role of central problem of microplastic contamination is fish. Okay. So what's happening is that supposed to have lots of plastic that's been produced worldwide and some of the plasma turn plastic bottle and Zeppelin the ocean side quite a bit ends up in the ocean by Indonesian China the worst offenders based on the most recent research and these break down into small microwave a plastic particles. Now the other source of this microplastic particles are these Michael plastic beads that are present in cosmetic and cleaning things like you  Facial scrubs at putting in these products they get washed down and to the sewers and they end up in the ocean millions of tons of this kind of stuff ends up in the ocean and guess who eats at the fish and the animals in the ocean.  Okay, so let me go to.  So first of all, this is all optional is not on your side. This is just a fun to have to worry about this.  But it pertain to what we were talking about in this group of lectures and it's a very current as of 24 micro beads that they include in some of these facial scrubs for example, and they took a picture in a microscope microscope with the bees found in a facial scrub and were able to take some see samples off of Hong Kong and they find these beans all over the place. So the fish are eating these people that one problem is that they are not natural. They wouldn't provide any nutrition for the fish. However, if they just simply pass through an Ultimate Upgrade, it wouldn't be so much were problem. However, there are toxic compounds that get lead out of these beads and these beads buying toxic compounds in the ocean when they get the adjusted they release those toxic compounds was actually a source of toxins.  When does the plastic is present in these boots? What happens is these fish eat? It goes up the food chain begins to buy accumulate and so in addition is a plastic as well as and his leash into the tissues of organisms that consume the top of the food chain.  You looking at it's okay. So we end up adjusting fish with these microplastic within them by particles. But also that the toxins that they contain so there were several Publications. He talked about the Maccabeats and personal care products contaminated to see so it's very clear based on the research that this is going on in a massive scale. This ends up delivering contaminated fish to us.  And one of the contaminants that's present is BPA. You haven't heard of that. That's an endocrine disrupting a chemical that they used in Plastics to soften them. It's also used on these receipts should get from ATM machines and on grocery store you touch those receipts and then eat from those hand then you're getting BPA contamination. It's also present in the lining of cans a lot of canned goods have BPA and that's where we get a lot of pee pee and it can disrupt our endocrine systems development lead to increased risk of obesity whole bunch of nasty. So what they did is this study looked at the level of the BPA in fish that was can in this particular group and what they found was American. Tuna tuna in oil from Europe.  And blue crab from Asia tuna and oil from Asia had the highest levels of this BPA that one of the problems with this these data however is most of these work and we don't know if the BPA is coming from the can that they were stored in or if it was coming from the natural fish when they analyzed fish that were not canned non can Seafood products and this is what they found. I found a pretty low levels in American.  Sourced fish but European Source fish the muscles strip Venus muscles and we're very high levels of this BPA. Okay. So that was an example of one of the things that we have to consider when getting a mega threes from fish. Okay that also demonstrates why we need to start reducing or eliminating these toxins from the environment and reducing the load of plastics that were jumping into our oceans.  okay, so that's the  Story on  that video that just came outside recommend checking out that site particular if you're interested in going on in nutrition or keeping up you can subscribe to a listserv. You just emails me every time something becomes available great site.  Okay.  so  so last lecture we talkin about metabolism synthesis and degradation of fatty acids also talked about the digestion of fatty acids in the transport of lipids and how our bodies have to deal with the issue that these are very hydrophobic molecules. And we are environment inside is a quiz has water. So it has to stabilize and work with his very hydrophobic molecule. And the way it does that for digestion is using uses emulsifiers the left of bile acid and at the transport around the body that packages things up in these large lipoprotein particles.  Okay, as diagrams here, which is a, Greg glomeration of triglycerides cholesterol membrane protein are proteins as well as surface coating of phospholipids that help solubilize is hoping that's what moving things around in the body.  Okay.  Stop this where we left off last time. Okay, this is lovely slide. So let me give you another perspective on this light is a lot in this life. It's and give me feedback saying this was some of the students in the discussion section was struggling with so let me just another way of looking at the slide to help got to make it simpler simplify conceptually the help you grapple with the information on here cuz this is critical for a discussion that we're going into next which is atherosclerosis. So there's a lot of things happening here. There's a lot of interchangeable are things getting exchanges, but conceptually, this is the way I was how I view it to try to understand simplify what's going on one way is to Simply look at the triglycerides first get those particles are complicated. They got proteins. They got cholesterol phospholipids and triglycerides, but if you look at each individual components separately that helps make it a little bit easier following what's going on.  Look at the triglycerides first. So it's either come in from her diet and end up being absorbed by the small intestine and I gave you the pathway of digestion on Tuesday. So if you're not trying to move that go back and check that out cuz it's important cuz what happens is it breaks its things of the triglycerides down and then it reforms them in the cells of the small intestines and then they get packages triglycerides into lipoprotein particles of lipoprotein particle that come out to the rest of the body. That's pretty simple. Now the liver is also a source of triglycerides. I can store it delivered or can make it to Novo a fatty acid synthesis. It sends out these triglycerides to the rest of the body in the form of the V ldls.  Found both cases these lipoprotein particles rich with triglycerides are floating around in her blood and they have to deliver fatty acids to the cells of the body the muscle cells for energy. The fat cells to store fat man shipped out. So how do these cells extract the fatty acids from these lipoprotein particle? Well, the way they do that say out here in a muscle or fat region of the body. There's days I hears the artery. Let's say on this very critical juncture the endothelial wall here between the blood and the rest of the tissue there is ease lipases that clip off you should know what lipase is are now lipase is clip off the fatty acids and release them and then themselves in the surrounding tissue can absorb it.  Hey, so that's how they're extracting the lipids from the vldl in the chylomicrons.  Once those lipids get extracted once those fatty acids get extracted what you're left with is remnants and the job and these remnants then get recycled back into the liver the liver packaging extracts all those compound and then re bundles them to make new lipoprotein particles.  I know I we haven't talked about the HDL. So we're just focusing on the way. I did on Tuesday. So the right here, we just focusing on the triglycerides and I just want to have you folks on the chylomicrons in the VA. So once those get the little fat asses get clipped off they end up like this are oh here it doesn't show for The chylomicron Remnant specs of the LDL, which is a vldl Remnant or the actual when it's called when it get recycled back to the liver. Okay. There's a very important receptors in the liver. We're going to talk about this cuz it's one of the targets for drugs the most recent drugs in the pharmaceutical industry perfecting a blood cholesterol level and that's the receptors in the liver that bind the LDL LDL receptors sit in the sales at Battle sites of liver. They come along into the bloodstream. They buying in the liver takes it up.  Okay, so that's the triglycerides. So now let's look at the other critical component the cholesterol.  Okay. So how do we get from here to here? So that's the job of the lipoprotein lipase has.  Okay. Hello Okay, so this thing is filled with glycerol.  Is lipase is with your present on the surface are the in the philia lining of the arteries as these things come by. So these things are floating around in space. They're actually floating around in the arteries in the blood system and as they float around when they encounter a lipase fatty acid gets clipped off.  And then the Federation gets absorbed by the cells around it that need it.  And what's left?  Are these complexes so these are isn't this is basically a vldl for the fatty acids have been taken out stripped out.  Okay, so let's now look at the cholesterol and this is probably the most important one for looking at hard to see so cholesterol can be made can come from all sorts of places it coming from the diet. It can also be made by the liver could also be made by the cells out in the body so it can be in a lot of different sites.  Now one of the part of the particle that has the most cholesterol by weight by density is the ldls so it ends up with cholesterol from any of these sources and it's been shuttling along in the arteries.  Now the cholesterol that's present in the LDL.  Source is unspecified here can come from liver could come from the diet. I could come from the cells making it around it.  It normally gets shunted back to the liver along with the rest of the remnant and gets processed by the liver. So when the LDL ends up back in the liver is transporting not only the remnants of leftover parts of the lipids. It's also transporting that high concentration of cholesterol, that's present.  however, if for whatever reason cholesterol  and as an example LDL particles with high levels of cholesterol should get stuck in the arteries in a particularly if they should invade this end of cilia lining and get buried in here. You can have the beginning of plaque could beginning of cardiovascular disease. So that's what I call. So the healthy way of recycling Quest getting rid of it from the blood have a transport back in the LDL be picked up by the LDL receptors in the liver and liver process. Is it route or halfway for this cholesterol is it gets deposited in the walls of the artery and can start causing Havoc?  Now what are the jobs for the main job of the HDL is to prevent or work against the deposition of cholesterol in the artery walls its job is to bind the cholesterol and transported back to the liver to minimize the amount of cholesterol that's here in the blood in the end of the Ali lighting the question.  Okay, you going to see that? That's why I'm going. Okay. So the LDL is in the arteries transporting around that says about being carried in the blood system. And then if it gets to the liver the liver can bind it and reprocess it. But if it gets too high or some abnormality abnormal pathology occurs, then it can get deposited in the wall of the artery little bit complicated. That's why it's lectures electricity by the most difficult but this is key to understand the number one cause of death in the world heart attacks and strokes. Okay. This is a process that goes on during hardening of the artery. Okay. So normally ldls are removed from the blood system by binding to LDL receptors in the liver. The liver breaks it down. So this process of the normal recycling back to the liver is supported by a healthy diet low in  Call Fat's special low in saturated fats.  The disease State however, the LDL accumulates in the blood vessels and this is 2 key points. I just talked about the cholesterol to other things happened to trade disease one is that inflammation occurs at the site of deposition and this leads to a lot of oxidation occur in the show you that in a second but these are took a long time for people to realize that these were important components of heart disease that was over a hundred years ago when people looked at arteries prickly and people had heart attacks found Fatty streaks in the arteries. Is it all maybe this has something to do with these arteries clogging up they look at the compound until the order of the fat speaks and it was mostly cholesterol total cholesterol must be involved.  What's the total accumulation of cholesterol that causes these plaques and that's causing people have heart attack while that process involves oxidation and inflammation what happens is that in order to remove this cholesterol build-up which often includes LDL particles with high levels of cholesterol  White blood cells monocytes within convert into macrophages become scavenger cells and they try to eliminate the cholesterol from the artery wall.  Okay, however, this can result in the formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.  This process of deposition of ldls and cholesterol into the walls of the arteries the oxidation inflammation process for aggravated made worse by the causes or risk factors for heart disease.  Smoking diabetes hypertension information to be City and too much animal or trans fats. I'll talk about trans fats in a minute. Okay. So that's the concepts and show you in a bunch of different forms. Try to help solidify. What's going on here cuz this is quite complicated.  What's going on, the basically a start from a healthy vascular system which flows freely and hears the blood vessel?  There's a muscle layer around it. And then there's is endothelial lining.  Is the interface between the muscles and the blood that issue is one of the most important issues in her body. It's so critical to keep that help it because if we don't our blood system begins to fail that can lead to Strokes peripheral neuropathy, it can lead to heart attacks and so forth this tissue here, we have to keep healthy in the best way to do that is by a healthy diet and not smoking. All right. So however, there are processes that no poor diet or injury of some type. You can get the beginning of cholesterol plaque forming after an early injury, then it begins to accumulate to Advanced cholesterol plaque and then ultimately leads to which has a very small opening that opening sometimes called the lumen.  It's very small for the blood is restricted. I'll get it through and if there is a wound or something that causes thrombosis blood clotting.  That can clog completely nuts when you get the catastrophic effects of heart attack or stroke. It was when the blood vessel completely stops.  Okay, and the shows more cellulite what's going on here is a healthy artery with the red blood cells and particles containing cholesterol. That's actual cross-section large Lumen good flow.  Early-stage atherosclerosis here. They show an injury can occur maybe this damage to the to the lining of endothelial that could be something physical for Corbin in the artery could be caused by high blood pressure can be caused by some chemical damage from smoking something like that. You get an injury and then signal start getting sent off from The Inn at the aligning that causes the LDL cholesterol to start depositing in the behind the endothelial lining. What's that starts happening the body starts an immune response and inflammatory response is monocytes high blood cells start to invade here to start digesting that cholesterol.  Is late-stage atherosclerosis those cells then start digesting the the cholesterol that's present here and they become was called foam cells when the debt diagnose diagnostic cellular characteristics of advanced atherosclerosis. So there's a pile up of cholesterol monocytes macrophages and then and then ultimately phone sells these macrophages that I've been trying to eliminate the cholesterol and here you see actual cross-section the beginning of plaque forming restricting the opening and it's harder to flow blood flow.  Another picture of a open healthy artery and this is one that's Advanced. That's a tiny little bit of artery left hard people often start feeling angina start feeling pain because the cells are not getting enough blood not getting enough oxygen. Sometimes people don't feel anything. It's interesting roughly half the people who have heart disease their first symptom that they have a heart problem or have heart disease is a fatal heart attack.  That's their first symptom. I didn't know it. So that's why I eating a healthy diet and have no promoting health is so important because a lot of times you don't feel it now by the time people do and so then they start going in for treatment and trying to reverse this.  Now this not only happens in the heart. It also happens in the brain. This is cross-sections of arteries in a healthy brain.  And this is the cross-section of arteries from somebody that's has atherosclerosis in the brain.  I noticed this came from an Alzheimer's and Dementia Journal.  It turns out that there's a whole class of dementia not just all simers, but that's cool Dementia or people start losing their cognitive abilities. And that's because the arteries in their brains start clogging up.  In fact, the first paper that was published on Alzheimer's by dr. Alzheimer.  He was the one that actually wrote the paper. That's what's giving his name reported that there was not only plaques which is one of the characteristics of people look at for Alzheimer's but there was massive amount of atherosclerosis of the people who had Alzheimer's so this may be a primary cause or at least a critical cause of Dementia in dealing with this very serious disease.  Okay, so hopefully I can emphasize how this occurs in a simplistic level and how important this issue that were talking about was probably the most important issue in nutrition and medicine because is the number one cause of death. Okay, so causes and risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis. So when you guys your age you're more susceptible poor diet high in animal protein high in cholesterol high in saturated fat and of course transfer over that in a bit smoking high blood pressure diabetes and obesity are all strong risk factors for atherosclerosis not doing your body and if you want any favor if you have these risk factors,  trying to show you some of the data that  link cholesterol in the blood with cardiovascular disease American Heart Journal 1995. I looked at coronary artery disease so they called it and they looked at the mean amount or the level of serum total cholesterol and how many people died of heart disease out of a thousand in each one of these groups.  And it looked at 350 6,000 people. So this was a massive. So I just had a big impact on the field and you can say people have less than 167 at relative risk of 1 but as you get higher goes up, so if it's in the end, this is the cutoff here. I just had blood panel done recently. My Physician's office 200 was roughly the cutoff for healthy levels. What a 30% increase cordingley stata think 22230 was the next one. That's double the amount that you're about to 64 for X the relative risk of having dying for an area of coronary artery disease based on blood cholesterol levels.  That's an easy one. Remember or I'll to to measure and that's done a lot in in lipid panels when you go in for a physical.  Just curious. How many do you know what your blood cholesterol level is?  I'm shy. Okay, no good thing to know it's one of the indicators you can tell how your body is doing its genetic control this some people have low blood cholesterol so high you have relatively High good to start doing something who died or if they can approach the medication which Racine second that would decrease your risk of getting these complications particular as one gets old. Okay. So now it was a classic one that was using indicator for a risk of cardiovascular disease. However other ones have been employed and here is a paper came out in the American Journal of Cardiology 2006, which kind of rank them based on some of the ones that are also possible to use as a risk factor is your total cholesterol and said I was wasn't even significant in this study, but it was a 20% increase in Risk LDL is often used as well. So when you do standard panel, you know that not only total cluster.  But you also look at LVL. Oh, okay that was better a 90% as ratio statistically significant. If this 95% confidence interval drops below one like this point nine three is not considered significant. That's why I'm saying significant or not.  But what I want to point out to you is this one here cuz I had appreciated this until Gregor put out a video on it. And I think it's absolutely critical.  oxidized LDL  8 times the risk factor  So the focus has been on cholesterol and that's clearly an important aspect to this whole description this whole this issue. However cholesterol is a lipid that can get oxidized. Can you get metabolized? They can get metabolizer oxidized naturally in food, they can get oxidized during cooking. You could also get oxidized when everybody's Well turns out oxidized cholesterol is a very potent toxic molecule.  It is carcinogenic. It's atherogenic cause plaque it's mutagenic and neurotoxic everything. I looked at. It's very toxic. In fact, one of the things that beer point out of this video is that cholesterol can't normally cross the blood-brain barrier so they have a lot in your diet, but if it gets oxidized it can cross the blood-brain barrier.  And I can get into the arteries of the brain and because it's such a potent molecule it and it's supports.  Inflammation and plaque formation. It's very very potent.  Okay, so I think a lot more pension should be paying on this oxidized cholesterol and oxidized LDL and is very highly related to cardiovascular disease. That's something I've seen anywhere else. Other than that they pulled out.  All right.  Okay. So this summarizes High total cholesterol has higher risk of cardiovascular disease higher LVL. Sometimes called lousy for the album density. Just the way people remember it even higher risk of cardiovascular highly oxidized LDL very high risk of cardiovascular summarized. Is that okay?  Okay, so that's the story of the ology would have some a critical Factor. So how people treating this is a huge Market lot of medicine is as devoted to treating heart disease and complications their up. And so one of the approaches is to use a genetics modern by medical analysis coupled with pharmaceutical development now.  One of them so this is too examples of two mutations that occur naturally occurring that informed us about what can control the levels of cholesterol in the body in the blood. So I mentioned the LDL receptors. What's our job?  Remove the LDL in the blood. Okay, where they located what happens if you have a mutation in an LDL receptor, would you expect?  High high cholesterol levels, okay, because the ability of the body to remove it be at his primary healthy pathway has been impaired. So people have been found that have mutations in the Albion house and they have high LDL and higher risk of cardiovascular disease and the people who originally described this down in Texas got Nobel Prize cholesterolemia and families that they analyzed and if you're a heterozygote you had heart attacks in your 30s. And if your homozygous for me these mutations yet heart attacks and your team's okay. That's how significant it was. Okay.  Now there's another more recently identified Jean pcsk9 and it's involved in controlling the degradation of the LDL receptors. This is one step removed. It's not the LDL receptors itself. But the the pathway that regulates the level of the ldls that's control and if you mutate this chain,  You end up with higher levels of LDL receptors?  If you have higher LDL receptors, you would expect higher or lower ldls.  Okay, so you got to think back one step. Okay decoration is impaired.  Therefore the levels get higher of The receptors and therefore the LDL levels go down. The drug manufacturer said, whoa, let's see if we can get a drug to Target and activate this protein and they found two.  Evol oku map and I lyrics to mob protein and activate it and these papers were fairly recent and they found in clinical studies that it work that could reduce the levels of LDL and improve the cardiovascular disease outcomes of these patients. Okay, Brett brand new stuff drugs targeting this Gene, which was identified through mutation. Analysis are not familiar with houses.  Okay, that some of the more modern wants some more classic ones are statins and aspirin statins are Inhibitors of enzymes how much does research career studying this hmg-coa reductase it's involved in cholesterol synthesis the first step in the production of cholesterol. That's one way to reduce cholesterol levels. It seems to work. The other interesting thing was discovered more recently. Is it also suppress inflammation? And I don't know if they figure that out yet. How does that sword attacks two aspects of atherosclerosis inflammation and cholesterol buildup?  So that's been given out quite a bit. There's quite a few people physically as they get older on statins most heavily prescribed medications out there.  However, whenever you deal with medications, you have to wonder are there side effects. Well the case of statins that are  the statins because they inhibit this enzyme are are mitochondrial Inhibitors mitochondrial toxins. They inhibit the manufacturer of a critical compound in the mitochondria. And as a result, they can result in muscle pain and damage memory loss and diabetes and increase the risk of breast cancer over 10 years.  So the question is is the benefits over weigh the risks and in many cases, it does because cardiovascular disease or heart attack is a big killer but there are also given it was interesting. I was reading an article this morning and it said that this was discovered by the fact that pediatricians who were doing Consul ectomies removing tonsils by children were giving them aspirin gum to relieve the pain and they would chew his aspirin to get into their throats for you the pain locally and they're real and they just noticed that they bled more readily it took longer for them to heal. They have more bleeding and so I thought well maybe it's inhibiting blood clotting and they said maybe this would be useful in preventing heart attacks. And so they tried it and it work with her studies big big positions health study looked at the effect of aspirin on Carnival.  And they stopped the study early because it was so effective. They didn't want to want to do the control group anymore because there were driving them as an effective treatment. However,  aspirin has a bad effect.  Because ulcers in the stomach, right? Why is that?  Hibbetts Cox yeah, yeah. Okay. So one of the  prostaglandins  Synthesis is inhibited by aspirin is needed for protecting the stomach lining. Okay, so that's the downside and there was a proposal to have everybody healthy or unhealthy on aspirin, but they got rejected open. I think I mentioned it because of the side effects and now it's just giving the people who have potentially heart trouble.  Okay. So those are the classic treatment Statin and baby aspirin as well as he's modern antibiotic and antibiotic treatments that are being employed. So here's just the pathway of hmg-coa reductase acetyl coenzyme a number. That's one of my favorite molecules. If you remember that's not your girlfriend's favorite molecule. See them coenzyme a way to remember that that's in the junction of many many Pathways in this cluster all pathway in the first step is catalyzed by HGH MGK reductase. However this  I'm not going to be up that night. When's I'm q and this is needed for the electron transport chain. So when you and have it this people get when they take these stats.  Okay, so that's the pharmaceutical approach. Is there another approach?  Well, let me talk about dietary approaches that decrease blood cholesterol at the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is a nutrition class after all. So these are the components in diet that are known to increase blood cholesterol levels and perhaps increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the most obviously the one that's not controversial as trans fats and I will talk about that at the end of lecture second is saturated fats now, I put it as controversial because there's been some real ups and downs even more not quite as much as cholesterol the certainly quite a bit ups and downs and people attack date for you and the several reasons one is there data out there that there is but there's also political side and they're usually acid in nutrition huge industry groups depend on people buying and eating lots of saturate.  Pat's meat and dairy industry industry. So there is vested interest in keeping trying to show that these are healthy and especially came to a head it was two three years ago. There was two big meta-analysis that were published that show that fatty acid consumption was not correlated with cardiovascular disease risk.  Topline journals to American Medical Association that showed people had high levels of saturated fat intake and low levels have the same cardiovascular risk time article seed butter and I showed you last time that's why that article came out was because of those papers that show there was no risk and there's no correlation between disease and also put dietary cholesterol and I say this is super controversial and you just saw on Hampton just gave you a paper from last month showing that it was harmful and all the responses that came out and you know, the industry groups and scientist on the other side all went ballistic 10 years to try to make sense out of this. So if it's confusing don't be concerned  So this is what I've been able to extract from him.  Another and I'm not an expert in this field research has been in plant biology. So I can't give any Prudential. I'm sure other people in this field has my initials make something different but this is why I give the warning that this is what I've been able to come up with that makes sense. And the wife is in it is that what the people of the people that I most respect in the field Dr. Rowlett from the Harvard School of Public Health. He is Chairman of the Nutrition department for many many years has most respected nutrition experts in the country. In fact, he ran he was a huge studies the nurses health study by which I'll talk about in a minute and he gave a webinar right after that those papers came out and this is how he explained in the made a lot of sense to me. So I'm going to share what he came up with this Electric Slide from his webinar.  So just came out in 2014. So here is looking at saturated fat intake of saturated fat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease. So things that are higher on the on the y-axis higher risk and things are down here are Laura's. Okay. So if you look at a population there taking pictures that look at all of us saturated fat and there's no change in the risk of cardiovascular disease. How are we pointed out that this difference is not in isolation people that have low levels of saturated fatty acid intake compensate that for intake more intake of other things in their diet.  And what you're replacing the saturated fat with is very important because that will impact the risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, if you were to replace butter with margarine margarine is full with trans-fats Butters got a lot of saturated fat. If you do that transition you increase your risk for disease for trans fat replacement increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. If you were to replace the saturated fat with refined sugars of with sugars and refined starch fiber in that you will also increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. In fact when the fat came out as the villain food manufacturers  Started pushing low fat food you seen that in the store is low-fat healthy, but low fat doesn't taste as good as high fat for most people. Receptors in their tongue and response that so what did they replace the fat delicious fat to keep it as palatable sugar?  So they weren't doing us any Farberware. They also increase the risk of diabetes. If you replace it with a mixed by cynic index. Did he talk about glycemic index load of XO. So the higher the Bison mechanics the more sugar there is  Solve mixed glycemic index carbohydrates, it doesn't change it at all. And so that's why they overall population that it wasn't showing any correlation. However, if you replace saturated fats with whole grains fiber rich foods or with unsaturated vegetable fat High monounsaturated polyunsaturated spread your risk goes down.  And that's what was missing in those papers is what you were replacing with yours actual data of mortality associated with increased percentage of energy from Civic type of fat is mortality risk from Journal medic Medical Association 2016 replacing the fat saturated fats with monounsaturated goes down a little bit. I said animal-based Foods basic with vegetable place of foods that have iron oil then you risk goes down if you replace it up.  Okay. This was a huge study three and a half million person-years done for the day was very strong.  Okay play questions on that. So that's one why it's controversial and this is the best that I've been able to make sense out of it after struggling this with years.  We all Copenhagen that would take me an hour to discuss. So let me try to simplify it.  What are the points you're going to get later in this lecture? And I think it's extremely important. I hate to kind of give out the take home before it comes up. But when you base nutrition information for an individual based on these large studies, you're extrapolating into dangerous Zone and that's exactly what's done. So you take these large epidemiological studies and say you shouldn't need eggs. You should eat eggs, and then you tell that to an individual person. Well, that's a huge gap between what you find in a population study. And what's happening in a person's body.  And that's to why the Gap in my opinion and I'm not an expert in this field to to actually make 4 many before most people it would work. So to adopt any particular diet would depend on the person.  Now a vegan diet has a lot of healthy components and if people had a lot of healthy components, however, just have some things that are missing B12 is big and you want to make sure you get enough vitamin D and the DHA and EPA cuz you're not going to get any PN DHA from a vegan diet advantages is very high in plant-based foods. And in fiber, that's the real advantage of it. So the elevator talk recommendation. I say a plant Rich diet the more plant-based whole plant-based Foods you put in your diet the healthiest going to be as long as you make sure you're not going to be missing these critical nutrients and other things we talked about in vitamin D vitamin A B vitamins, as long as you get those things covered then this would provide you with the fiber in the fight of nutrients that most people are missing in our diet.  That's how I answered it. So a vegan diet can be unhealthy.  French, fries and beer. All right. Okay, that's a vegan diet, but I wouldn't recommend it. So Whole Food plant Rich diet with the healthier plant Foods grains and whole grains in the beans legs and so far. There's a healthy time. So that's how I like to present it. So now we're going to move to cholesterol.  Okay. So remember most cholesterol is made in the body, but we can swim some of it. This is about one egg yolks worth as a body makes it the more we consume the body can compensate by making less of it in case we have compensation mechanisms now us dietary guidelines in 2015 dropped the limit No Limit no more than 300 milligrams per day and they drop that but they did Cape minimize your cholesterol intake.  now  at the Hamptons paper he gave you this year. So she ate of dietary cholesterol and consumption within the cardiovascular disease mortality. So too much dietary cholesterol half an egg a day. I mean, there's a lot of people who eat more than that. I mean they can eat six-seven times of that on one breakfast play increase risk significant.  Okay, so what to do about this data, so  There's several issues that come up and probably the most important one in my mind is considering the personal variation from person to person. Some people will do just fine and some people really suffer from eating too many eggs. So the original studies that were done show no correlation between cholesterol intake egg intake and heart disease the original that paper that  Dr. Hampton gave you was the first one that I have seen that actually made a statistical significant correlations. That's what's remarkable about this scene this however many times in the past 2010 for example in 2008. Is that for a healthy person? That's good good cholesterol compensation. They should do. Okay go way overboard. However, there are two specific groups of people who would be harmed by a negative an egg yolk talk about the egg yolks where all the cholesterol and saturated fat. For example, the big one is diabetics.  A diabetic person who has one egg a day versus one that has zero ink hasn't hundred percent increase risk of dying from a heart attack.  Now all this debate on cholesterol, where do you who does anybody mentions that I have yet to see it except for the few people like in this article now roughly estimate 15% of our population in the u.s. Are diabetic another 35% or pre-diabetic which may also be more susceptible. So we potentially looking at half our population that could have a condition which would make them more susceptible cholesterol that is not been discussed. That's a huge Omission. I mean that needs to come out that sell your eggs are fine. I said, what about diabetics and they don't seem to know this data. I was just kind of shocked is very clear. Now another group of people that are also people have pre-existing heart disease.  And a lot of people do and they not even know it. Okay. Okay now  Now one of the things that was brought out by this paper here, that's a question I go it's not for patients with vascular disease is that when you increase your cholesterol intake one of the outcomes or one of the problems that result is that you end up increasing the rate of LDL oxidation.  So what was that very toxic compound I mention.  Oxidized cholesterol. This is the last thing you want to do to cholesterol in your body is converted into this toxic compound and high dietary cholesterol intake does exactly that at another issue that comes up.  So so that's pretty strong evidence that too much cholesterol is a problem. Now here is the actual data very few that I've seen this is maxcel date on the compensation, which I've been talking about. So this is a Christian publishing American journal of clinical nutrition has been a while ago 1992 and they did look at individual increase in dietary cholesterol given to this patient's and they ask what happened to their total cholesterol concentration. How did it change?  So in this range in here, so this is 200 to 300. It was be the limit right here will be the limit of what they're recommending in the diet. That's about one egg yolks worth. So you see at this level even up to about 800. There are people that compensate quite well.  Exchange at all. So they can eat eggs cholesterol in with impunity. They can metabolize it there. Okay back. There are people with mutations in that pcsk9 that inhibits. The gray is LDL and their immune is much as they want and their cholesterol levels.  So but if you're in this group here.  Then your blood pressure was going to go high. That's what I said to recommend a specific diet a recommendation without knowing this seems like shooting in the dark. You need to know this before you can actually make a recommendation and this is Way Beyond where modern medicine and nutrition is at people are starting to look at this and this is much needed but that seems critical least theoretically to know before you can make recommendations. If you get really high even the compensators don't can't handle it. So it just depends on who you are and you basically unless you're diabetic and if you are sensible, but otherwise, you don't know which classification you are in here if that's what was major issues.  Okay, so we're about to leave that's real sclerosis and heart disease.  Alright, so let me finish up my talking about where's fat is stored in the body adipose cells adipocytes nucleus cell vacuole containing fat lipids quite that stores fat are the two types of white fat and brown fat, which is mitochondria Rich. That's why it looks kind of brown generates heat and it's used for thermal generous thermogenesis. There's a hormone that actually which is induced by exercise, which I should convert white fat into Brown fat, which is kind of interesting. Here's some pictures of white fat cells. Here's a brown fat and this is with all those mitochondria the whites that stores energy storage lipids few. Mitochondria. Brown fat does dissipate energy has many mitochondria.  Okay, that was originally thought that brown fat was pretty prevalent in babies and gone and it don't fit but they found Brown fat in adults in this is up by the neck in the collarbone area and they had radio label glucose and they did pet scans on people that were in a warm environment and a cold environment and we get put in a cold environment your brown fat starts turning on start generating heat to keep you warm. And so they can measure that by looking at the radio label glucose production actually evidence that there's a little bit of brown fat in there. So I'm not sure did the doctor Hampton talk about regulation of fat deposition in his metabolism.  Discount Computer real quick, so hopefully talk about insulin controlling glucose. Okay also controls lipid metabolism as well. So insulin storage, so when insulin levels go up in adipocytes free fatty acids get taken up and get converted into triglycerides and they're stored. So insulin supports storage by supporting the reverse glucagon and stress hormones promote the release the breakdown of triglycerides Three fatty acids and glycerol and the released into the blood. So this is harm only control. How do you speak hormones and the target one of the targets? It's well-known. Are these hormone sensitive lipase has  So if you feed somebody something there in this inhibits the Y peces and lipase is of the ones that clip off the Three fatty acids. So it stays on the molecule. And so you have less of the release of free fatty acids. That's the anabolic situation and if you need to break things down because you haven't eaten in awhile glucagon stimulates life Aces and breaks down the fatty acids.  now  there is a very important aspect of fat tissue not just the cells with the surrounding cells in the the fat tissue. This was reported in nature. 2006 major advanced was actually review was reported earlier and that is is that fat tissue is more than just storage of energy.  Fat tissue is also an endocrine tissue. It releases signaling hormones into the body.  This shows some of the ones released directly by adipocytes but some surrounding cells. It was well and the fat tissue in the body releases hormones that can promote inflammation and diabetes. This is why Abby city is associated with inflammatory diseases and diabetes is because the tissue itself is releasing signaling molecules that support or enhance these conditions.  Okay, that's very important Concepts understand that it's not just the storage Depot but also an endocrine system as well.  Now where the fat is stored in the body has a big impact on its health effects.  Now we have two primary places simplify conceptually a horse fat is stored. What is subcutaneous? So that's right at the surface of the skin that provides. I'm sorry provide insulation and and is a safe form of that the visceral form. However is deep inside the body and a lot of it accumulates in the abdomen abdominal fat and that's the dangerous fact this  Can compress the organs and releases the signaling molecules directly into these vital organs of the liver and pancreas and that increases the risk diabetes disease and hypertension. So one of the ways that Physicians and scientists measure whether or not you're overweight because they simply take your waist circumference you look at some of the statistics to measure BMI. They also use waist circumference and this is a proxy for how much visceral fat you have in your abdomen and that is what is can be harmful for the body and this is actual scan is a cadaver's showing you the fat deposition is the cross section.  Forget it.  Caesar arms as opposed to the length. I hears the spine and just the belly. Okay, so this represents so this is computerized tomography CT scan. So this is the subcutaneous fat. So these are actual real images of of the tissues that I'm describing and let me just Kim just a little bit.  So here's the subcutaneous and here's that visceral fat that I'm talking about your nurse a spinal cord so that surrounding the stomach and can compress them.  now  what are the things that control how much fat we have in our body is how many adipocytes cells fat cells we have in our body and how much fat do they store at least fat cells can expand when we have too much of a diet and contract when we need them.  However, they are laid down these fat cells through our life. And this is an actual plot of adipocyte cell numbers as a function of age Papas nature 2008 of an obese individual and a lien person beside number and this shows that adipocytes or lay down first 10 years of life and then as a teenager and then when he had about 20, it kind of levels off. So if a person is obese, it's often because they have laid down more out of a site sells early on in life and then it stays high so we get much older they pretty much stay the same so they are left with that for the rest of their life. One of the reasons why it's so difficult to treat obesity is because there's a higher number of fat cells doesn't mean it can't be but it makes it more difficult cuz he's adipocytes are calling for fat for lipids the store. So what happens?  Earlier life is critical for dealing with the Obesity epidemic long-term.  Okay.  I just left that side cuz I wasn't very interesting out implications oxidation.  Dimension One oxidized cholesterol very toxic you can also oxidized triglycerides and those end up being harmful now the oxidations occur on double bonds normally.  Okay, so  Okay, so these double Bonds in the unsaturated fatty acids are Target's for oxidation.  So  would you expect the saturated fat or polyunsaturated fat to be more susceptible to oxidation?  Volume saturated. Okay. So the more double bonds the more susceptible to oxidation. That's why I fish oil does lotto Mega threes, which has three double bonds goes bad so quickly. Well, if you put coconut oil out that way for years has nothing to oxidize oxidation factors include exposure to air oxygen and UV light. So if you have some oil that you keep I mean, I love it. Somebody has olive oil to keep it in the kitchen and white clear glass room temperature in the cupboard.  You smell it got its about faint from the smell of oxidized lipids in there. What you want to do is keep it cold.  Green bottles are bottles that life doesn't get through and if you like you can even out a little bit of vitamin E an antioxidant.  No, one of them or one of those toxic of these oils are trans fats.  It's not so much a problem. Now as it was.  Because what I'm about to describe butt.  The evolution of what was considered a healthy diet is changed over the decades and originally people a just animal fats butter lard. No problem. And then the idea was that they had high-level saturated fat and cholesterol that was harmful for Hart Street heart condition there for you needed polyunsaturated fats need vegetable oil and vegetable oils. And so the food manufacturers shifted vegetable oil, but the problem is just that you can't spread sunflower oil on toast. Like you can butter doesn't taste the same. So they needed something that would be solid at room temperature that has a vegetable Source nowadays people starting to use coconut oil but back then it wasn't so plentiful. So they manufactured vegetable oils should be solid at room temperature and so they would take these polyunsaturated fats and they would hydrogenate them.  That means they would add H2O bubble H2O and reduce these double bonds.  called hydrogenation  if you completely hydrogenated you end up with a completely hydrogenated a polyunsaturated. What would you end up with such great good. Okay. The problem is if you did that commercially with a vegetable or you end up with skull the brittle fat. It's not useful the properties of that are not useful in a cooking setting or in a product setting. It just doesn't have the right consistency. Do you need for the weather get around that if they partially hydrogenation?  Partial hydrogenation so they left some of the double bonds present.  Now when you treat this, so here's the big aliphatic chains on this side. So  I have it. Okay, same thing. So if you add hydrogen and stuff so that you reduce some of these you're effectively adding a catalyst which will allow this to go into a transition state where you don't have a double bond and this thing can flip.  And what I can sleep to.  is the  trans  forum  a naturally occurring fatty acids are sis. This is a trans which of these is more thermodynamically stable.  Strands of these two big bulky are groups are competing with each other if you catalyzes transition from things going to flip because this is more stable and that's what you get. So if you partially hydrogenated,  Is vegetable oils, then you will get this flipping from the cyst form to the transformed and that's what was put in food for a long time margarine was a big Source but cookies and crackers all sorts of things where they needed to have an oil or Crisco Crisco was another example used in pies now.  It's a lovely story. I love the story.  So back in the middle fifties.  The when I was born when the wooly mammoths roam the planet late pleistocene.  A physiologist a working at the University of Illinois was analyzing the plaques in patients who had died of heart disease heart attacks and what he found was most of the plaque was composed of trans fats. And this was a time when this vegetable oil transition partially hydrogenated vegetable of transition was in full swing. So people eating a lot of margarine at the time in Crisco instead of butter and lard and he was finding that most of the Plex contain this trans fats. So he said I think we have a problem when you publish this in 1957.  At the TransPass extremely high levels in Plex. He then tried to get people to be concerned about this warn them try to put cautionary advice is out to get press involved. Nobody would listen to No policies were changed. However, he was able to convince that Walter Willett the guy who had that slide that I showed you was chairman of the Nutrition department who included in one of his large epidemiological studies. It was called the nurse health study to it was the P. I was in a tens of thousands of nurses were part of the study. They were tracking their diets and what happened with the Kardashians has diabetes and so forth and so he convinced him to include margarine intake. Thank God. He did to include it in Willits agreed. So they tracked  Margarine consumption hi low medium and the risk of cardiovascular disease and what they found was that the nurses that have the highest amounts of trans fat had a 50% increase in heart attack rates.  That's because he's trans fats increase LDL and kind of screwed up the ability of the body to process fats in the blood.  So when that news came out, it was clear that trans fats were harmful.  However, it wasn't until 2013.  that the FDA finally  took transfax off the grass list. Generally recognized as safe as compounds are ones that food manufacturers can use with impunity is on that that's giving you the okay. This is the FDA approval. It's fine trans fats were on that. So was in all our product made of our product it got taken off thereby preventing or prohibiting the use of trans fat. This was 2015.  5 and a half decades after the original publication  The reason I like that story is because we have a happy ending but we have five and a half decades where people ate lots of trans fats and I am one margarine baby. Okay, what's margarine there are lots of cases in our diet. Now foods are not been taking off with his already evidence that there harmful and it just takes a long time for the FDA government regulation Regulatory Agencies to work through the system to beat off the opposing industry groups that want to keep selling it to actually get this enforced. This was a great example. So you want to use as much of a nutritional knowledge as possible and keep up with the literature to go looking at nutritionfacts.org and not rely completely on the Regulatory Agencies. Sometimes they take a little while. I'm fine. Thank you and will have no effect over on Tuesday.  Strasser want to bring them over here.  I think I slides with a foot away, though.  It's offline, Google.  Okay, I will 111 midterm. Please. Bring your backpack to the France then put away all the notebook all the textbook. So I write it with distributed exams. "
