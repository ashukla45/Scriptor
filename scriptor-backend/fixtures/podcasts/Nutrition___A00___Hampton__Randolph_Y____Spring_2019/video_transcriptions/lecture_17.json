    "Full Transcript": "All right. Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Last two weeks of class last two weeks of the school year.  I know it's exhausting doing what you do. I admire it. I also want to say and I totally mean this that it is an honor to do this. This is maybe one of the best jobs a person can have and I really every single day go to work grateful that you people allow me to do this and I just totally mean that I think it's important that you know that this is what we're doing here is an incredible thing, you know, however, we got here the universe created us the universe made us because we are the tip of the universe understanding what it is. That's a powerful idea. So we're involved in a incredible Endeavor here. Okay. I didn't even get a chance for a fancy picture cuz I have so much stuff to tell you about the day we're involved in this bold experiment. I had a brief senior moment where I couldn't remember this 4-Digit thing. I just want winged it and  I was right. Yay. So this happened suddenly information drops out that you is wrong about the eighth being 48528.  And that one I think is right. Yeah, so I got it right. I I I lost five years going that way. Okay. So that's that we're going to do another thing. I know I'm obsessed with this idea you guys reading stuff. I found something. That's one page long one page long. It's almost like a tweet. Dress in winter bass. This week's discussion quiz questions on this little mini article that I want you guys to read. It's called that it's this one here. You'll notice you go to Triton ad.  You going to read it?  It's called processed food an experiment that failed. It's just very passionate very strongly Angie corporate or in the industry. We shall we say Scream by this fellow Robert lustig who is absolutely remarkable character in biomedical science. This is the Pediatric a physician who discovered or found his dismayed that he was getting more and more children in the 95th and 99th percentile of obesity routinely in a major US metropolitan area, you know all sorts of young people. He went on an Endeavor to understand. This is his his angle on this is that added sugar and processed food, especially sugar is a huge problem in the food supply is written abandon articles on this is one of many opinion pieces. It's literally a page-long and it's it's actually very sociological and it's very interesting. It impacts on some things that are super important for understanding that  Medicine in the societal aspects of eating and food, but they also impact on some science to but this guy is so passionate about this that he decided being of being a PhD and an MD being a physician is not enough. It's not enough to deal with the real problem is the problem is not us understanding the science. The problem is modifying the laws based on the food supply in Basin what's considered safe and what's considered appropriate physically, so he went you'll notices I'll do this thing.  I can make it happen area. You'll see it says Robert lustig MD and MSL is a masters in law. This guy at age 50 went back to grad school to get a law degree so that he would be better able to deal with policy policy writing policy understanding ever try to read an actual law and we all know what the laws are don't drive on the left, but you ever read a statue how complicated and difficult that languages are. This is the degree to which this this person is committed to trying to bring some change is too literally he's had to learn the language of the law in order to to be this. I think it's really cool.  And I'm 10 years older. I hope I can find that kind of passion in the things I do. I think that's really awesome. Anyway, read that there's a couple of interesting questions. I didn't have time to put them up here. I will say out-of-state them.  Do probiotic supplements help with obesity?  You know, it's quite clear that the that the microbiome is very involved in the degree to which we do or don't experience obesity causing effects of high caloric food and different peoples prone to obesity at least part of that seems to map of the microbiome in ways. We don't understand and probiotics are these you know ways to modify our microbiome the trouble is that as far as anyone can tell now this is very this is early days. So this might be changing. It is very hard to change your microbiome just by consuming microbiome components, you know, there's all sorts of supplements that are living organisms need a few billion Colony forming units is just hard to do and microbiome is remarkably stable, even though it varies from person to person is highly stable there a really interesting studies. Were they literally transplant microbiome? Sue the other route that seems to work a lot better simply from proximity. The colon is where they are, you know by the time  Microbe the probiotics get but get to the Kona Town than we have been on a trip. We've been acid. We've been in a storm soon as he heard you been there other routes and they're in your there might be other formulations, you know taking probiotics is perfectly reasonable, but it hasn't yet become a Magic Bullet like how to keep intake and you'll lose 10 lb before the holidays does apple cider vinegar help people to lose weight. So I looked into this a little bit and vinegar as all kinds of acetic acid has a very interesting effects on blood sugar and health, but they're very poorly understood. No one quite gets why a few tablespoons of vinegar a day or tablespoon vinegar a day seems to help certain people to again one of those in a large scale.  Prospective studies, are you see changes ships in percentages of benefit. So it's it probably has multiple health benefits, but no one's quite sure why you're such a simple molecule acetic acid. Is it the pH is a combination? Is it cryptic phytochemicals a cup of vinegar? Who knows? Okay, one more. Let's see.  How can we break our sugar addiction gradually my spouse decided sugar anymore and we have a house full of little balls of candy so got to get rid of those. She just said I'm not eating sugar anymore and she's been really Vigilant about I'm thinking this is I don't like where this is going through sickness and health. Okay, but no sugar no sugar and it's actually amazing about a weekend when she had the worst headache like this incredibly bad headache that was Lassie for days and I don't know if this is true, but you know head-to-head is where all that stuff psychosomatic real pain perception, but she ate some sugar like a little candy bar and felt better. I don't. I don't know what that means and I'm like sneaky or sugaring out. Here you go.  Oh, yeah, this is a banana. Anyway, it's the way the way actually people suggest we break our sugar addiction is one thing that we get good at is we keep Shifting the register of art to get more and more comfortable and more and more sweet things, especially with artificial sweeteners where we at least think their guilt free and not Cousin calories. You can add a crap load of sweeteners the thing and get used to eating very very sweet flavor. So one suggestion is to just dial down the sweetness of the things. We just like salt salt the same way we become extremely insensitive to salt and demand huge amounts of it in many food. So one suggestion I read is that that just diminishing the degree of sweetness of the things we eat. So helpful way to move in that direction and apparently you get more comfortable like, you know, the average Young American leader blueberry and think it's bitter. It's not like covered with sugar. So, you know, we gradually ship those registers back that's one idea.  The pictures on PowerPoint on viewable you mean the the downloaded ones there was a problem with that file. You'll just have to use the PDF I can't do much about it now and I apologize. There was some funniness with bad. How about the PDF? Is that doable?  No, either no.  seriously  Is the I have a confirmation on that? Okay.  Do a little research. You know what I'm the boss we can do a little research and see what happened. I can't read this Triton Ed.  Yeah, I know that that's not a secret.  That's a secret. That's why they're dots see what happened. Okay?  God damn  they are.  There was a boy.  There's a lot of fireworks.  I'm opening it.  There it is.  What?  What's missing  none  are those are just blank slides that I left these ones here.  No. Oh, yeah, those are but wait. Let's see.  Oh crap.  God damn  Yeah, they're the same ones an extra 15. Those are the early ones, but they should have come through. I'm sorry about that. Let's check this as long as you're doing an experiment together.  And those are from lecture notes early ones are electric 15. I will check again. I apologize.  I see that.  That's okay.  Hauser from 15 send a PDF looks like you're 15, then the ones were 16 the brand new ones for today or okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.  Technology. Okay. So let's get back to what we're going to watch now mine will disappear. That would be pretty funny.  Pretty damned funny. Okay. Well, I'm sorry about that. I'm glad we have this interface. We can together explore. All right text questioning. There's that interesting connection. I want to make a connection that actually a student came up and talked to me about so many other studies that we talked about like the classic one thing that carrots that he were they they showed when one group or one large said, he showed that they take that carotenoid rich foods as the ones foods that have a lot of those colored pigments include beta carotene and retinoids that those lower the incidence of lung cancer, but lower the risk, right and we talked about this and if you  Then take people and put them on a beta-carotene Rich supplement. Are you just give them a beta carotene supplement the opposite happens, you know, it seems a lot being changed notices in studies like that. Two things are happening and wheat, this is what that was. The subject was gushing you removing a type of food Spader carotenoid which food and then you're adding something else. So one of the hard things about understanding sort of nutrition, you know, is that often when you switch from one thing to another you're removing something and adding something else and this can be pretty complex or guess that's one case where you removing a whole class of vegetables and fruits and adding a supplement and we started together thought about this did not only did you lose the benefits from the from the vegetables and fruits, but you lost something there was an added risk of adding the baby carrots at 8.  Sheraton we talked about this and discussion section. And in the same way when we talked about process food. You know what I think the Pima people that payment First Nation or is there a great example of what is an example of pipe to all of us not just a particular subgroup is you know, what happened to that group is they had developed and all of us, you know, the Pima are simply in an amplification of something is happening to everybody. You don't get 30% obesity rates from a specific ethnic subgroups. You know, that's very general. There are ethnic differences there are race and ethnic differences, but it applies also whenever that happens. What you doing is losing a certain diet and gaining a different one. So it isn't just you know that we're eating processed food. It's that we were benefiting Massac maximally and evolutionarily from one diet that involve lots of plants for a little meat processing.  Positive been preserved in the way that people cook at home less salt taking that away and then adding a whole other diet involves these other things and you're the Pima are particularly were particularly brutal version of that because their way of life which involved as I said irrigation sustenance farming and a lot of really elaborate ways to deal with living in the Sonoran Desert going through famines. It's not like the Pima had it figured out anybody in those kinds of environment. I had periods longer is multi-generational. Famine and you know real challenges to be fizzy fizzy ology nutrition, but you know, the ultimate result of that was a good sort of balance with the environment.  So with that was removed brutally in the case of the Pima, you know, another cases is just through isolation or or changes in the economy. They lost a certain diet and gained a new one. That's really problematic. And the thing about it is it's not just the Pima. It's all of us, you know different people responded and there's no question that we don't have a uniform response to anything like a nutritional change. But as a population it is a massive numbers. It's worth mentioning also that there are other populations that have been studied and that are a great interest to also have been through periods of intense famine in their evolution, but not the Pima. So there's actually a number of Pacific Islander. So-so Island cultures are another place where this could be really problematic as if you're not an island in the middle, you know of the South Pacific and ate the weather changes for a butt say 10 or 15 years, you know, you're upset ocean like you don't have any  Except to go through that salmon. See you have multiple cycles of famine possible there too. And it's not a coincidence that there are number of Pacific island people who were okay, you know relatively good in terms of BMI disease and then when industrialized countries in the case in the case of the South Pacific Islands the ones I'm talking about in micronesia's have they were first introduced industrialized food during World War II was World War II there was a huge incursion of highly industrialized highly processed food and also just neck and eyes delivery of calories to those countries and many of them then became industrialized as a result of that and there are Island cultures as well very distinct from the Pima in terms of their human history was similarly by being through waves of famine at least have a genetic predisposition for terrible responses to process industrialized food talking again, like 50% Obesity rates 95% diabetes. So it's a it's a  It's not something restricted only to to Southwestern Native Americans. It's any human population has been through multiple cycles of famine and nurse had those jeans, you know, sir Amplified simply by population selection, very important very interesting issue. But this removal of one thing whether it's through brutal aspects or just drift into an industrialized culture and the addition of that is his two components. Okay, so we were talking about energy expenditure in and there's no question that one of the major problems with a westernize industrial diet. Is it so incredibly easy to obtain and consume calories. I mean, this is a giant feature of it as is and I'll show you an example of a soap. How many calories do people now we got this is really variable all different to the tune of every few hundred base pair. So we're all different. You know, we have different habits different pain.  Reward pathway tuning up, you know, I mean you probably have to experience. This is way after you're not hungry. You still like to eat, you know, I hate that you're sitting at the dinner table with a bunch of friends maybe restaurant. Maybe we'll have a great time you finish your meal and then you keep picking and is aware of the desert and then you open the box and put their meal in a can and you just keep consuming and it's there's actually been studies showing that people will consume about 25 to 30% more calories if they're presented with them then if they're not it's just it's the way we aren't it makes perfect kind of think, you know that food used to be pretty rare and lows around is a good idea to eat it to a great extent. So thinking about that we want to understand calorie balance. So how many calories do people actually need? Okay. So this is the this is one of the waste of anybody's energy expenditure. That's just the amount of energy you're burning for all Endeavors really boils down to three.  Basal metabolism that's you know, the the cost the ATP cause the energy cost to operate and maintain a body in has all sorts of processes going on all the time This Is Why everytime you breathe, even if you're sitting quietly CO2 comes out because you're breathing in oxygen even if you lie as still as possible CO2 will come out cuz you're making your burning lots of energy theater. Do you burn is basil, you know, there's physical activity in this includes, you know voluntary activity and even exercise if you know, you can push it up a little bit and involuntary activity called non-exercise activity. Thermogenesis neat, you know, it's just the movements we all make and we now know that there are different degrees to which people are fidgety and movie all the time and it actually impacts on their degree of calorie burning and then there's this crazy when the thermic effect of food, which is a small fraction of the calories that we burn come from the actual Act of eating  Chewing consuming secreting and processing the food and that's kind of wonderful. You think now you burn calories eating that sounds good to me. But unfortunately, there's no it's not in any way you never in the black from that, you know, but it is an interesting feature of it. So physical activity value is usually a 1.41 Point * * basal metabolism is going to really very a lot, you know their athletes who know train multiple hours a day Hooper way more than that from their physical activity. The thermic effect of food is a very small fraction of the basal metabolism. Okay, so it turns out that you can send have roughly calculate how much energy in an average person needs based on their height.  Can't wait your height and weight and their age height weight and age. Now we've got this is a public health day. And this is actually a pretty famous with I feel it's usually teach this in the exercise cost in 108. So if you want to wait or heard this before repetition is the parent of learning so you can benefit from that, you know, but this is a very famous study by two guys Harris and Benedict gun in the 1980s or a long time ago. You know, right after World War II ended they said we need to figure out how much energy people need to know and so they didn't NASA's study with the tens of thousands of people that study their their energy needs and they ended up with these two equations. What I want you to go to some of these equations is this tells you how incredibly empirical this is there is no theoretical model. There's no physics in this where people put together.  Basic principles and derive an equation for energy. This is purely empirical collection of data and to tell it is the the parameters meaning the things that don't change, you know, the constant are so different between men and women in this is simply because of the way the regression lines went. There's nothing this somehow this must map to physiology but only in a public health way and nobody really knows why why so women and men there's some sort of a constant plus a multiple can buy body mass a multiple can buy stature minus a certain fraction by age. This looks pretty pretty wonky. But what I want you to know, this is two things is that bigger the stature a higher the higher the higher the weight the more energy needed that make sense cuz a bigger machine requires more energy and that as you get older you have to subtract a certain amount many as we age we need less basal energy. That's pretty cool.  chances R question  You don't have to talk a lot louder.  Is 655 and 266 which is very weird. The question is is this one step correct ending 655 and 6s. You think it was a misprint and actually checked in this textbook before but it is actually different you know, and it's it's because they plugged in in 2000 values and measure the energy in this is what they got in terms of the regression line. So it's a consonant fell out and it's either you can go compute it if you want yourself. Okay. And so basically this is the way it is in might be that the body mass and stature changes aren't you know don't affected as much and so there's a bigger number that stays the same knows I don't think there's really a lot of physiology that you can discern from this, you know, and I just wanted to check it out. So the trouble is it's kilograms and centimeters so we have to modify it. So this is how you convert kilograms into pounds. This is how you convert centimeters into  I just you know, you you are you do that and you plug it all in and this is inches. I spelled inches wrong effective breviate inches. And so this is my harris-benedict. This is purely Public Health. But if you plug in this is my weight is in my height, which is changing all the time. This is my age. I went back and modify the side. So I'm 1259 calories a day. That means if I do nothing by the Harris Benedict equation, I'm burning about $1,259 of this again is really really do not plug this in and decide that's how much you need to eat to keep the same way. Cuz it is this is you know, a public health in when it's a good rule of thumb and here's the problem. Okay. Let's go to In-N-Out Burger. Okay, so my number and I actually know my number is around 1,200 because I eat about 1,100 calorie 150 calories a day, which I count for purposes of my sport that I do as keeping light.  Is really important for running. It just helps the running economy. So I know this is something I know and here's the problem go to In and Out Burger Burgers. Awesome. You know, how do I don't know if I'm ever going to eat anything like this again now that my house has become plant-based sugar free. I don't know what I would but let's just have a typical meal have a cheeseburger with onions will have an order fries and we'll have a shake cuz it's Memorial Day weekend, you know cs450 just a regular cheeseburger cuz it double-doubles are awesome. But they like for Patty's right like that, but I usually could I can easily eat that meal and can go with you this afternoon and probably really like it up to the time when I left the place in my life.  But that's for it. That's 1455 calories. So that's more calories in one meal. Then I bake I burn basil relaxing in 24 hours. So that is a dinosaur nature of the Beast and then if you go to like this or I went to that place Shake Shack a few weeks ago and Shake Shack, you know, they make these beautiful delicious burgers and they've always variations. One thing to notice is that food goes down almost like adult baby food. It's like incredibly easy to chew. It's incredibly rich and you eat so because it's so so little work to consume it. It's a huge part of processing is also removing the fiber and any impediments the swallowing, you know, it is and it creates this blast of different reward Pathways that really are only now being understood. Okay, so what about activity, I mean, I want to explore this idea of when we're consuming lots of  What do you have to do to burn out with what kind of activities cuz that Harris Benedict equation is basil activity. That's just sitting around 1270 goes in and out burger and has a pretty regular kind of meal there. You know, it's going to be over his daily requirement. So what kind of Misses are a bunch of activities and one of the depressing things if you want her one of the things to keep in mind, I don't want to call it depressing. It's just worth give you mine is we are incredibly efficient converters of calories in demotion. We are really good at converting small numbers of calories in two very significant motion, which is great. What an awesome biological machine we are but this is like some of the some of them sitting standing knitting knitting. Okay, that's cool sleeping. That's particularly but you know golf with the trolley cough without a trolley. That's really surprising that you need.  Table tennis tennis tennis is high in somebody's running really hard. Now. These are all different Power walking and another thing about calorie estimates in exercises. It's very individual do not be fooled by your Apple watch into thinking that you walked a mile and it was 200 calories Just As Dead As those are really rough estimates. Okay, but the important thing is that it takes very little food to subvert a very large amount of activity calories. So this is actually a chart that has the is the number of minutes you need to do different activities to balance out these kinds of things. What's a glass of orange juice under 10 calories. If you're resting it would take like over an hour and a half to just get rest burn those calories walking jogging a piece of pizza that is very modest most pieces about 300 calories per slice. I don't know what kind of micro Trader Joe's slices those are but  Alright, okay. But anyways, the point being here is 3 oz of sirloin steak a cup of shelled peanuts apple pie a la mode meeting a piece of apple pie with some ice cream on it. It is incredibly easy to over to surpass our energy balance in this is actually were thinking about an understanding. So here's the thing as you know, there was this roaring debate. You may not know this thing will talk more about this in the nicest is Raging debate. Is it the amount of calories we consumed or the type of calories are consumed that's a problem. Like you might say he doesn't matter if I eat all protein or all carbs are all this and many diets. What they do is they choose a certain ratio of different macronutrients and swear by it. You know, the way you'd invent a diet is stink it up come up with a cool name and then swear by it at least one person that helped and make them the spokesperson, you know, but so the interesting the addressing issues  Just the amount of calories we taken or the type and the answer is probably both are important at the extremes. You know, if you go way down eating you can adjust your way in on the way that clinics the way Physicians get people to lose weight, you know, in in the clinic supervises by just lowering their calories drastically a few hundred a day with the right kind of food that makes you not hungry and try but the basic physics of body mass is pretty simple as calorie in and then these kinds of things is basil activity physical activity in space on included in this case in thermic effect of food and anything else, you know, so the in physical activity has any kind of movement at all, and it really that's it just has to add up to that. There's there's no one knows what you store and what you burn in those two have to add up to each other. Okay, but the details were perplexing the problem with this simple equation is it  Text someone is are all calories the same, you know, do you know where how how do they store is bate as mass, you know, as there's some sort of, you know, removal of them through the microbiome to other aspects. Okay, how did the conversion of excess calories to massive diarrhea among people, you know different people may be better at story than others. We really don't know that what are the effects of extreme weight change on this balance. So you might have a certain balance, you know input output body mass change and then you gain a hundred pounds what happens then to this equation or you lose a hundred pounds, you know, there's some studies indicate any people metabolism can change for a long time after they lose a lot of weight and that probably is individual also. Okay, so that's were thinking about but one of they clear things about the food supply that's problematic independent of the removal of all those phytonutrients in fiber and all that stuff that helps us is the sheer calorie load is so high with process.  Food is incredible. It is amazingly easy. It is hard to eat 500 calories worth of Apple. If you take it five apples and eat them. You'll be at it for about an hour. If you take a Shake Shack Burger, you'll be done in 5 minutes and have eaten ten Apples worth of calories. It is really, you know, just that fact alone than the other issue is what are you losing? What are you gaining? I miss the start of the new wants what you want to think about this. So now we're going to talk about another aspect of the Obesity or or food supply problem. And that's diabetes diabetes for two reasons is number one in for 3 years. Number one. It is incredibly prevalent illness and many of you will encounter it in your practice is you will definitely encountered in your family and and and relationship life as you grow older and meet people there's tons of people that have this disease and it's not going away.  I want to talk about it because it's clearly one of the dis benefits of the altered food supply that we're now experiencing and Thursday. It's one of the one of the illnesses where lifestyle and nutrition changes can really help they really help in ways that are only now starting to understand. Okay.  Okay, let's see. So the national diabetes statistics report. There's many many because it's such a prevalent disease. There are many aspects of this show in 2015 an estimated 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among people aged 18 years and older that's a lot of cases, you know, if that's a new cases of it because it's a chronic long-term disease. You have a certain number of people and you keep adding to it, you know, the numbers are getting really big nearly one-in-four adults living with diabetes don't know they have the condition or they didn't know they had the condition in this particular survey. That's because it's not an overt thing like getting the flu is a gradual decline and metabolic status and gradual gain and pathophysiological problems it get worse and worse as people get older. Okay, so only 11.6% of adults with prediabetes knew they had it so pre-diabetes is for we're going to talk about next it is Akin.  That predates diabetes and is in the indicative of the problem being there. Okay. So this is diabetes in the US as of 2015 and all groups are affected. There are some racial and ethnic groups that are more strongly affected the reasons for this are probably a pretty complex combination of socio-cultural and genetic aspects that have not been parsed out. You know, this is really important Avenue to understand in this is sort of but even in all groups are affected. Okay in this is between 2013 and 2015 National there's a number of different data sources some of them acquired through physician visit some of them through interview, but the basic trends no matter how you shake it or are going out. Okay. So one of the reasons that we are interested in diabetes like have just meant that you had to take more so in that would be okay but not great. But the problem is that what comes with diabetes is a whole host a Galaxy  Of different clinical problems that are very significant very significant problems. We can cause blindness kidney failure heart disease stroke loss of toes feet and legs. I actually have friends my age. I bet I know out in the world who have lost parts of Limbs because of type 2 diabetes. They've had it for a long time. They haven't taken good care of their weight is stopped exercising. They work really hard demanding jobs, and they're now suffering those consequences and those are not reversible consequences. Diabetes is the number one cause of blindness kidney failure and amputations in the industrialized world. It's a major cause of death from diabetes is cardiovascular risk of heart attack and heart failure is between 2 to 8 times as much for people who have it depending on other factors know these are all secondary effects of the primary illness, so they're pretty  Text but you'll notice they map a lot to the cardiovascular system. So a sort of a place of some hope perhaps is understanding this syndrome called pre diabetes and prediabetes. It's really not something different illness. What it is is a indication that you're on the path to getting type 2 diabetes too early in the early symptoms of insulin in sensitivity and  basically pre-diabetes is a serious health condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal. So I should I've actually defined diabetes in an earlier lecture. So so they can't believe it but I will say it again diabetes maps to inability for insulin to work either because it's gone. There ain't no insulin. That's type one and we'll go I have slides about this enough to scribble Natalie and type-2. Is it in Citta growing in sensitivity to insulin that causes a number of different problem. So it's all about insulin not working. Well now insulins main effect that we know about you learn this probably in high school or Elementary School is insulin controls blood sugar. And that's the first real obvious symptom is poor control of blood sugar and elevated levels of blood sugar. It's important to realize it insulin controls lots of anabolism in Sunset. Lipid storage and you know creating triglycerides and there's lots of different Avenues of poor insulin availability.  A response that are impacted on and type 2 diabetes. Okay, but so we'll talk about this. So proximately 84 million American adults are more than one out of three have prediabetes. And so yeah, this is is an end some large fraction of those people go on to get type 2 diabetes. So it's really worth understanding. So yes, 70% of pre-diabetics become full-blown diabetic send part of this just a numerical thing. They are cut-offs for glucose levels at rest or in fasting glucose tolerance. And what is the primary cause of ha1c that we'll talk about him and hemoglobin A1c those three things if they are above a certain limit that goes from prediabetes to diabetes. What's a long-ass spectrum and it's really a diagnostic tool to see where people stand and so 90% of people don't know they have type A have pre-diabetes in this make sense cuz people don't normally measured their blood sugar.  And people don't normally think about these things. I actually partially goes up as you will see type 2 diabetes increases with age and because I haven't had the best diet up to the last few weeks is actually bought myself a little blood glucose monitor and I am not in that. You know, I'm always on the border of pre you know in the mornings. I'm okay. I went to the doctor but you know, I am thinking maybe I will do so I can pay some good attention to this but most people don't understandably the cool thing is you can you can go to Walmart and buy a blood glucose meter for about thirty bucks and measure your blood glucose every morning. It's extremely interesting and it's all show you that's going to change drastically that's going to really it's going to become a whole different animals understanding blood glucose, but a pre diabetes associated with early forms of kidney disease retinopathy eye problems vascular disease and this is something you'll people thought about a lot.  So let's talk about diabetes prevalence and in this is probably not a shock to you because I showed you those maps of the of obesity changing and you know that obesity and diabetes are closely correlated. It's not a given if you're obese. You're not definitely going to have type 2 diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, you don't necessarily have to be obese but one the Obesity definitely predisposes a large fraction of people we don't know exactly what causes that fraction to exist what kind of jeans and two seasons Behavior diet do that. But it definitely there in tightly connected so not surprisingly the rates and the prevalence and the geographical distribution is very similar. So this is what I didn't know it's going to have that fancy thing. Holy crap. This is I got from the Center for Disease Control. So I'd be its debts your tax dollars making fancy slide. So this is a just it's not supposed to do that. So that's age-adjusted prevalence in 2013. And that's 1994 and so these ratios  Alright, you can save it just from the colors. It's gone way up in the last 20 years. And so this is like I showed you those type to the Obesity charged. It's not that shocking that we have them both. Grab the key things are widely prevalent much larger numbers and win the last 20 30 years. So happening very rapidly where I currently and so this is actually more long-term. This is from 1958 when I was just a little tyke hadn't even gone to kindergarten yet. Probably didn't even know how to read and this is the gradual increase in this is percentage with diabetes and Ken gross number with different scale. So they do not surprisingly. So it's not like that, you know population. It's easy as the population grows to percentage in this year numbers go up and what's interesting notices. There's a break right around here in the early 90s and early 90s where the slope just starts increasing all the more, you know, something interesting. I went to Fargo, North Dakota.  A couple weeks ago to run a marathon was kind of an adventure and I stayed in a crappy little Motel cuz why spend a lot of money when you just knew going to be staying there in carbo-loading doing nothing and then you do the day before a marathon somebody asks ago. Somebody actually asked they said hey Randy how many extra calories do we eat before during and after a marathon race in the trick is I don't eat a lot of extra calories, but I'm biased a completely for a carbohydrate to load my glycogen stores sell. I don't need a bit more and then during the race. I actually bring 600 calories worth of fuel. So because that's how much you need when you deplete your glycogen stores sell biochemical and yet I still don't run. Well what's wrong in so but anyways, I was sitting the point. I want to make you guys a table and the one thing about the cable and a hotel and you were lucky if you don't know this cuz it's a pain is every 18 seconds is another commercial, you know, it's like watching it is so worth getting that.  Because time is money and you spend you know, if if you watch an hour of TV 35 or 40 minutes of it will be TV in the rest of the advertisements. Now, normally I would avoid that but this was incredibly interesting for this class because I noticed something is at least in Fargo North Dakota and I think here every single ad was either some kind of Highly processed incredibly delicious terrible food for you or I pharmaceutical companies ads. That's all there were there were there were incredible piles of meat and cheese and fries and fried stuff steaming way and everyone indicating their life would be better if they only had this to eat and gave it to all their friends.  And then there were these advertisers with 550 side effects for all these crazy drugs and get some of them biological that are antibodies some of them small pill. That's all there was and there's struck me that this is a remarkable sort of synergistic thing is all of these foods are making us all sick to the turn a two and a 30 people 30% obese 10 50% type 2 diabetic and then all these drugs that are available to do something about that. It's the opposite of Wellness. My people it is sickness and I just thought this is really interesting that there's it's so obvious that next time you watch TV with commercials know how many of the commercials are four foods that are in a category of super high calorie super easy to consume suit, you don't see a lot of ads for the from the broccoli organization important to watch that and it's important because it's easy to miss.  When should I probably seen you a hundred million hours of TV on a tv nut but I just started noticed it in the last few years. I was like a goddamn everything they show is food. And what about a child who's watching TV a lot, you know where they see is this constant measured signal of eat all of this great stuff. Okay, I'll say one more thing but it turns out that there's a lot of social pressure did not eat small amounts of food movie theater and you want to watch a movie and we all know that Red Vines make you fireproof. So if you're going to like, you know Iron Man, you got to eat Red Vines cuz you're fireproof. I'm getting it but you want to buy a little popcorn popcorn social fun. If you try to buy a thing of popcorn is like this big it's like, you know only 400 calories to only a third of what you need for whole day. If you're my stature in age, you have to ask for a child's thing. I have to ask for the little tyke.  Persian you actually have to use them stupid name. If you go to a restaurant want to eat a small amount of food, you either have to bust their rules about the children's menu or ask for some weird sliced up thing. It's just amazing. There's actual social pressure to eat a lot of food, you know, that's it's really an interesting thing to him start you have to ask for these ridiculous things are come bundled with a toy in a little fruity thing in order to have just enough popcorn to eat and not blow your calorie limit really interesting were thinking about you know, you should be you should usually actually actually promised like I want the awesome hero popcorn to go. That's this one cuz you're a metabolic hero. So, you know, it's the opposite of what we were, you know, it's certainly not putting us in the right direction, you know, and if you listen closely, you lost your people young people bragging about how much they can eat, you know, it seems him nap sometimes to these sort of heteronormative male experience and I'm hoping that changes but you'll often see young men brag.  About how much they can eat and no criticize. I'm going to need a lot. It's really interesting. Maybe that's changing. I'd like to see that change. You know, it's it's really an interesting cultural overlay on the whole nutrition thing is eating a lot and be encouraged to order a lot of food is something that pervasive in our culture and our Recreation and in our commercial and are commercials about long-term increases type 2 diabetes. This isn't only the u.s. Is worldwide Trends the worldwide Trends and diabetes since 1980 pooled analysis. 751 population basis is 404.4 million participants and not surprisingly cuz I showed you those obesity stats. It's a type 2 diabetes is going up all over the world. This is a different things were adjusted by age change or Justify population growth cuz those can increase the numbers to a larger population and have more parts for big more people with that illness, you know.  Ice Age chips are going to get more people cuz the probability goes higher but what however you want to slice it type 2 diabetes is going up all over the world. Okay. So here are the risk factors age weight excess added sugar consumption is saturated fat in meat consumption. We're going to talk about these so age it's just bad news. Okay, so you guys are all here.  I'm not actually here still but I'm jumping here in a few months. So I'm here get the sugar out. I'm so but you see that's pretty substantial changes, you know, it's some of that might be diagnostic that you wouldn't know you had type 2 diabetes. So you wouldn't register as a plus but some of this is just as we age, you know, the system start start altering for to become more insulin sensitive and especially as we age in a culture where we're eating a kind of foods that are conducive to promoting the acquisition of type 2 diabetes so weight and diabetes risk is real. So this is actually a study that was done in the Journal of American Medical Association where they just were we're evaluating a large groups of people to see who had type 2 diabetes was interesting from is obese people overweight more than normal weight and obese more than overweight had a higher prevalence of diabetes over all of the different years. If this was measured, you know, this was not the purpose of  Study but it just fell out of the data. You know, I'm not surprisingly because we know they're mechanistic connections between obesity and poor insulin sensitivity that we're trying to figure out some sugar and diabetes risk. This is actually a pretty amazing study and you know, if if if I wish there were a condensation. This is a pretty complex paper, but the same guy Robert lustig who you will be reading one page of in a few a few days. This is the guy who, you know was a pediatric physician who decided to go get a law degree also to help understand policy and and food food economics. They did a study where they said this remember I talked about how availability of food makes us eat more of it. And this has been studied in Psychology departments in the nutrition Apartments were the amount on a plate of influence how much people eat not surprised you go to a buffet to buffet and has one play. He likes it just free. I need to know I need a backpack and it makes sense, but they  Is really use what's called econometric analysis. Okay sis is analysis using things like, you know industrial of reports and food supply and and and commerce data to say how do countries that have more sugar available per person in terms of ecopy econometrics. Like, you know, the amount of product is putting the store is the amount of different items that are sold in terms of sugar per person. How does that effect the tendency to get type 2 diabetes? So this is sugar availability measure the level of you know of a entire country's economic economy metric up profile. This is pretty cool study and I don't pretend to understand all the language of this like the method section read like and you know any economics graduate student, but what's interesting is they found they noticed something they said one of the problems is it if you correlate obesity to type 2 diabetes at the population level at the country at the at the  At the international level you find a lot of anomalies. You don't have part of this is just public health is like Sorenson's these are people who have very low diabetes are here is so pretty high obesity and not super high diabetes hear people who have pretty low obesity and pretty high diabetes. So there's these antique or let's and some of that might be the interesting mechanistic biology or what you know, what what is it? It might be why they're obese how they became obese. What kind of food what kind of whatever it's just that there's not a very tight correlation, you know, someone's iCloud of data so they were wondering if this sugar availability did not know you might go God that doesn't look any better it just in Big Blob of points, but the interesting thing is is a pretty significant correlation line when you do it by Sugar availability and you do guy be an actually look at change and sugar bear by Sugar Ray ability changes from one situation to another  What is the change in diabetes prevalence and although this again is this is a public health Hub City. It's a cloud of points with a correlation line through it. But the interesting thing is this explains if you know one variable explains the other much better than simply obesity. And so what they get out of this is using econometric models are repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food. So they did repeated cross-sectional studies from 175 countries is a big study be found at 150 kcals per person per day increases sugar availability. That doesn't mean sugar consumption. That means just availability you're giving it to the population, you know, you put it in here and now here you see what comes out in front of diabetes frequency. So, you know, there's a lot going on between the People's Choice to eat it. But if you did leave you still see about this is one can of soda a day was associated with increased diabetes prevalence of 1.1% So simply increasing available.  On a population level, you know gave you noticeable and highly statistically significant increases ended in this case the penis less than .0001 which is very significant, you know, meaning of correlation lines are almost certainly can't be random. Okay, so that's pretty intriguing and it says a lot about what we should or should not be supplying people especially our young people and you know, we're just young people we want to keep well and as I said, if you come into a store, you know, it is amazing. It's hard to find something that doesn't have sugar in it, especially, you know, when the front of the store where your impulse buy. So let's talk a bit about glucose management. This is a glucose tolerance test in these are one of the things you'll get out of this lecture. That's maybe a little distant from him, but very useful in terms of medical learning in your eventual path of the wellness and sickness axis is the basic terminology two terms of art for understanding type 2 diabetes.  Is a what is a glucose tolerance test and glucose tolerance? This is basically you take a person and you give them a bolus of glucose. It's usually ingested is 75mg. I mean, I guess one of the Silver Linings of a disease it so prevalent. Is there a highly standardized ways to measure these things because so many Physicians have to do it. So there's a lot of standardization and that's good. So I need glucose tolerance test is a you consume 75 grams of a test load of glucose. And this is usually done by ingesting, you know, just a cup 75 grams of glucose. And then what is done is the glucose blood levels are measured and what happens with normal people is there people who are normal diabetic or non diabetic as you get a burst it goes up to certain level and then it comes down and your glucose tolerance is defined as your ability to tolerate a bolus of glucose in Fruit diabetic, it goes up similar rate and it just stays up.  A long time is very high levels are normal glucose. And this is one of the annoying things are this terms of art is the normal glucose term is is  Is milligrams per deciliter so milligrams per deciliter that is milligrams is 400 mL of blood why on Earth they use that to this millimolar is beyond me but it has been around for decades and it's what people use and so the normal blood glucose is around 70 to a hundred something like that. And you think about it is pretty amazing that all these different people in this room all of us we wake up in the morning are blood glucose it for healthy is between 70 and 100 that's pretty tight. You know for people who are different every few hundred base pairs. It's pretty amazing that we can do that, you know, and I'm in a lot of people will measure their waking glucose with a monitor to see how they're doing in terms of their glucose regulation and normally waking glucose can be like 70 80 90 around there different people are different. I didn't make very much depends on when you last ate and how long you slept. Okay, and so this is sort of glucose testing diabetic now,  And so that's the short term. So glucose tolerance is short-term meeting you, you know, it tells you what the glucose regulations like in the last few hours.  But we're really interested in and what's really important is understanding the long-term effects of high glucose. So, you know, basically the thing the way to think about it, if you want the way to think about it is if you this is you know, this is glucose tolerance is like this, you know, I'm here is normal or whatever like that, but we really want to know  You know is the glucose levels over long periods of time or people eating and fasting and eating and exercising and fasting you know, and what is the average glucose levels over a long. Of time. Is there a way to measure that you know bar and having some kind of machine attached all the time and it turns out there's a really interesting variation on the chemistry of hemoglobin that turns out to be a great indicator of average glucose levels and it involves a modification of hemoglobin that this happens with by glucose and it's non-enzymatic. So you may think that there's never any reactions are enzymatic into a first approximation. That's probably true you the most reactions we talked about in all the classes you take our catalyzed by enzymes. In fact, one of the rubrics of biology is nothing will happen without enzymes and it's true but there definitely is regular chemistry going on and I want you to remember that glucose is an aldehyde. Okay, remember that glucose  Remember we draw the glucose. Is there any line? That was pretty smooth.  Remember that glucose spends part of its existence as an open aldehyde and then it forms this ring remember it's from the alpha ring in the beta ring. And that's always attacking it aldehyde and Purolator opening and closing. Okay, but any molecule of glucose pens a substantial amount of time open and close and when it's open, it's an aldehyde and I'd love to react to stuff. These are very reactive molecules just like acetaldehyde is problematic. If you don't you drink a lot of alcohol in your metabolizing it that way same idea. And so it turns out that that glucose can modify the amino groups on protein. Now this happens all over any amino group is susceptible to this modification happens at low levels all the time. And I'm it's actually the chemistry that happens when you brown meat with your how you put like barbecue sauce on meat and and and cook it and it'll get brown. This is part of that chemistry. Okay, so it turns out that he McGraw  When is one of these molecules that we have really really good tools to study hemoglobin so happens is glucose periodically when it's around modifies the hemoglobin amino group and makes this shift pays to shift a substandard organic chemistry and because of the nature of these o h is that will rearrange periodically by what's going on the Dory reaction to make this very stable addict and this is very stable addict will sit around for weeks in your blood. And so what it is is an indication of the amount of available glucose. Now, you don't have to be Linus Pauling to think it's out that the more glucose you have around with a set amount of hemoglobin the more likely this reaction to happen so different people with different levels of chronic blood glucose have higher levels of this modified or glycated hemoglobin is called hba1c is an awful name. So a hba1c distance for hemoglobin Shane a  Hemoglobin Shane A1C and so this is the modification of it and it's on the on the 1st amino acid the n-terminus and so it's not that hemoglobin some special molecule that gets modified. It's just when we're really good at detecting and you can pick another molecule in developed diagnostic test and look for it's like a nation. That's what it's called like a nation. Okay, but the fact is that they're really good choice of this is just a good indicator, you know, you can ask anyone how cold it is outside and they're all going to give you the same number. So we're just asking hemoglobin how much glucose is around. You know, this is Justin Bieber. Look there's nothing really special about hemoglobin being like and what is interesting about this is you have to understand that it's not so obvious in terms of straight biochemistry why elevated glucose a couple fold over a long. Of time is so bad for us, you know glucose is the stuff of life every song on the planet, Louisville.  Why is it that elevating it a couple holding you'll notice the diabetics two or three hundred milligrams per deciliter versus a normal person's around eighty to a hundred. Change and you think it's the stuff of life is elevated a couple what's the problem then you know, it's still something people are working on but some people think and they think it that maybe this kind of chemistry happening on lots of different proteins is why glucose is so bad for us when it's elevated a bit. You know, it's it's an interesting question. Also remember we didn't evolve to have glucose at five levels nor did we evolve to live for 70 or 80 years? So, you know the assistance that would get rid of these kinds of modifications may never have involved because we didn't need them, you know, so anyway, so this is what hba1c looks like and it turns out that hba1c is another really good diagnostic of poor blood glucose control because it as it gets higher it indicates there's more  Available glucose what is chemistry? So this is hba1c and diabetes. There's a million of these charts and then you can find them everywhere. You can actually buy an hba1c test kit at the supermarket or at the at at that Walmart or or Walgreens or whatever. Whatever your favorite drugstore is the thing about these tests unlike the glucose monitors, which were very easy to use. These are a pain to do their very spotty. They sell you an electric device that you have to use specifically with the test strips and you can't use of any else they have a certain quality control and also the results are kind of variable. I did one of these are fun, but I'll see if to draw quite a lot of blood and it's kind of gross. So it's just that I was curious about my hba1c and so I measured it but don't try this at home go to the doctor. But anyways, this is hba1c levels. And so the magic number is below 6.0. Okay, that's actually changing people dropping off work and this is just percentage of total.  It's glycanaid. And so do you always have a certain amount of normal person's for 5% So we're all doing this all the time. And so maybe one way to look at at glucose pathology is that we're all wearing it but diabetics maybe the slope of the curve is a little higher and so symptoms happen before they turn 120 and then we see that you know, that kind of thinking Okay, so  So this is the sort of a chart of that and it turns out that that there's a number of different ways to think about glucose and diabetes and the way we Define it in terms of glucose, which is a very reasonable way is there's three different sort of things people measure in the clinic fasting glucose 2-hour glucose tolerance meeting. How far is the drop when you drink that 75 grams how far is it from in 2 hours or your hba1c levels, you know what a given time and so the normal State these are the normal numbers is below a hundred below 140 after 2 hours of ingestion and a blow 5.7% for hba1c. Those are the goals of the sort of subsequent pathology and they're probably subject to some change and so impaired fasting. Glycaemia. Sundays are three different Diagnostics are free. Diabetes is impaired fasting glycaemia. Meaning of  Go measure your blood glucose is this it's not it's not in full-blown diabetes. If you're impaired glucose tolerance meeting after 2 hours. It's between these values its pre-diabetic. And if your hba1c is in these ranges, you're pre-diabetic and so physician notices any of these they're going to say and we should probably look a little closer at your diet your activity your family antecedents, you know, and other features that are going on. Okay, and then diabetes is defined as any one of these conditions being at these numbers are both you'll notice has an arbitrary cut up at 1:25. You're pre-diabetic if your 127 your diabetic, but truthfully if your if your blood glucose is consistently 125, you probably should start thinking about making some changes are thinking about the possibility of being a diabetic. Okay. So this is sort of the thinking about that.  Okay.  It may be common among young arrested brag about how much you but it's fairly uncommon among younger females. You have others also cultural pressure, you know, this probably really problematic about being inappropriately. I've been looking like if you open it New York Times Eeveelution supposed to be a moderately woke publication on Sunday and look at the fashion models, they need a meal and I'm glad that people have said those transfer may be changing a little worse under accept more body types as being attractive like that's or being marketable or whatever. So you're absolutely right. That's a really good insight and it's a weird sort of heteronormative dichotomy between you know, Colette knee and starvation and both of them are problematic and that's a good point. Thank you for texting that so  You better call me.  Yeah, that's a good question show fasting blood glucose is after 12 hours. So usually you sleeping if you go to Kaiser some and get your blood. They want to know that you haven't eaten for 12 hours. So I feel like if you sleep too little you'll need me I'll you wake up after 5 hours of your blood glucose. You don't know. How do I set? Ok, so we'll talk about type 1 diabetes a little bit. So this is in this is a very important on this cuz you know, it's something like millions of people have this but it's not on the rise. It seems to be a standard condition. So it's originally called juvenile onset, but adults get it. This is actually a whole other thing to talk about. It just seems to be a strange increase in adults like 40 50 year old suddenly getting type 1 diabetes were their pancreas undergoes autoimmune attack and disappears. So this is a whole it's called type 1.5 diabetes.  It's actually we're not going to talk about that but it's real interesting. So the accounts were 5 or 10% of the cases and it's due to loss of beta cells, you know beta cells in the pancreas is minor participant's a pancreatic mass that are actually major participants in controlling metabolism. It often between is between 8 and 12 years of age and usually the current are the current treatment is insulin injections for life is actually an interesting sort of side thing on this. Is that even though it has been a revolution in making insulin cuz if you go read that book The Discovery in so I told you about you know, the the real rate limiting factor and Insulin in diabetes stream used to be getting insulin from slaughterhouses from millions of pigs from abattoirs, you know, where you need a few million pancreatitis get it no reasonable dosages for a Statewide or Nationwide availability this on so suddenly I'm comes the molecular biology Revolution and it's quite possible to make recombinant. Insulin.  Companies like Genentech have done a brilliant job of converting that problem from one of animal husbandry into molecular biology, which is totally awesome. But for some reason that no one's quite sure of insulin prices are skyrocketing, even though it should be almost unlimited me available. It's become suit and it becomes generic. So there should be lots of sources. It's such a problem. There are now States passing laws that will limit the price of insulin no matter what its availability is because it's so crippling to people who have type 1 diabetes before you or type 2 vs Type to use use insulin also, so there's this weird disconnect between you know, the availability of Modern Biology and the cost of the product and its Mia were thinking about this is kind of thing. Like this is why some people may have to go into policy and law to make changes that are biomedical. It's interesting. So this is action example there plenty of people who can live, you know, very healthy lives with type 1 diabetes is Gary Hall.  He went an Olympic medals. He's a full-blown type 1 diabetic has two measures glucose multiple times a day and inject insulin. Okay. So the progress of type 1 diabetes is very different from type type 1. There's a. Of in childhood or nothing happens and suddenly symptoms get really bad. Okay. So you start there's snow this thought to be there some predisposition and no one really understands with that is then there's some sort of precipitating event. It's if that's very poorly understood cuz you can see families worth two out of three siblings get type 1 diabetes and they don't have none that doesn't run in their family. So there's precipitating event said no one gets rabies virus is maybe it's environmental insult. No one really knows and then you start seeing first normal instant release and Progressive loss of insulin and this is over. Of a, you know, a few years so by 8 or 12 years old, but in that range you start being overly diabetic and the trouble is that when you suddenly lose in Cincinnati near drastic physiological symptoms,  Really really problematic including going into you know, having a having a ketoacidotic crisis and all this and there's some so the dramatic symptoms are frequent urination and excessive thirst. I'm trying to clear all the glucose and water comes along weight loss due to an inability to use those in a polite to know use those molecules. Are we so type 2 diabetics where I'm treated her incredibly emaciated because their cells are not being told to take up nutrients Ketone body production and ketoacidosis is by the liver going to Great trouble to make glucose when it doesn't need to sew it burns lots of fat and produces this alternate fuel Ketone bodies it with the thought or the molecular thought that it needs to do that which can actually sit up by the blood and impaired immune functioning vascular system uses a crazy story about how quickly do symptoms going to happen. This is a guy named Urban me or is he was a young man around 2019 or 20 and he went to Vietnam.  Who is like Vietnam was a pretty crazy brutal place? I was in high school and was going on and he went there and got involved in an action or is all this combat going on any day. He was found and thought he was dead. He was put in a body bag zipped up and a medic happened to notice. He was checking identities and notice that this person in a body bag had a pulse of it was weak and it was Urban me our age who is undergoing such serious complications from diabetes that he went into a coma and passed out and he was put in a body bag cuz people reason we fight he along with a bunch of the soldiers in this action or dead and it's only by The Miracles of an opening that bag and checking him. So this is when this probably isn't going to happen to you if you have diabetes, but it is something it shows how old vert and sudden the symptoms can be. Okay. So Diabetes Type 2 diabetes we're going to talk about now is cancer 90% of the cases of diabetes. So 80% of diabetics are obese.  Overweight so there's this really strong correlation is not causation. There's obviously causative it back but we don't know quite what they are there some really important science going on about that. I seems like obesity especially ectopic fat that's in the wrong tissues can cause drastic insulin and sensitivity and then that can cause changes in lipid balance increasing insulin in sensitivity. So it's reduced insulin sensitivity. That's the main feature of type 2 diabetes and not see that leads to over secretion of insulin SD as the you have higher blood glucose and a pancreas. It's a functional start releasing more more insulin. And so you start getting a pancreatic failure. So the beta cells start failing because they're just on the edge of their ability to do what they do. And this has a number of different treatments unlike type one, which is basically Supply insulin, whatever it happens to cause there are a number of treatments to try to deal with the waning insulin sensitivity and the high  Glucose in all those problems. Okay. So there with type 2. Is there a few symptoms they take a long time to manifest and so even though you're insulin resistant initial blood glucose is normal because of pancreas over produces insulin. So in early type 2 won't even have elevated blood glucose at first, but they'll be compensating in a way that's not noticeable. Clinically but is very covertly problematic que me a prolonged high blood glucose which eventually and this is the second phase of these uses cardiovascular and microvascular problems. And then eventually you can also have liver malfunction fix. The liver is struggling to do what it does and making extra glucose and using fat resources to make that guy some sort of the progression of type 2 diabetes here is a mule have this is all over up here. This is years of diabetes is at a gyno. So you'll even have beta cell failure and insulin resistance, you know.  The pic and stays high and then you have a gradual deep failure of the beta cells because of constant attempts to make more glucose. Okay. So this is the thing is it's no longer type. It's no longer adult-onset. This used to be called that and even 10 years ago. You would have heard that term in your classes, but there's cases. This is actually a pretty incredible case. It has a happy ending the youngest case ever of type 2 diabetes with a three-year-old girl like this is almost would have been impossible 50 years ago. I'm a three year old girls diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or if we need one of the youngest. Okay. This is she was in Sweden a diet at home of unrestricted calories and fat led to an hba1c of 7.2. That's very high and a high BML. They didn't say what the body mass index. Was it mean for a child that small the body mass? Index Apple. Even on those tables and with Vanessa kind of go there with the treatment and can buy medicine and nutrition intervention nutritional intervention.  Six months to travel or gradually stopped her medication me. She went off the beds and dropped her hba1c to 5.3 which is actually fully normal and just endless 25% of her body weight. Meaning of those probably quite quite an impressive change for a little child like that. So the good news is a young person this age is reversible, even if you know, they're taken care of right away. So that's good. So that are the end of one of the questions that comes up. All the time is one of the genetics of diabetes and knee should have been not surprising answer because it's so prevalent in floating around like usually rare diseases, you know map to simple genetics but complex things like like type 2 diabetes like addiction like I arthritis these kinds of things have familial connections, but they're not you know, they're not a single Gene so tight when there's been some really good identical twin studies. It's a great place to look so if one twin has Type 1 diabetes needs a basic  Clone, the other has a route 8 is it risk is about 50% so much higher than normal, but still not a given. Okay, not a given type 2 diabetes eye when one twin has Type 2 II risk is at most three quarters or 75% so higher but again then with type 2, there's all these other aspects of Lifestyle nutrition, you know and things we don't totally understand something to pick up messages definitely genetic components, but there's no one gene. It says you're going to be type one and you're not okay in this is actually pretty perplexing. So diabetic treatment options so tight one involves monitoring glucose insulin injection and using insulin pump switch or starter relay to each other and type-2 is much more complex and involves meds. There's a multibillion-dollar industry of type 2 diabetes drugs that will talk about his insulin itself lifestyle therapies and surprisingly bariatric surgery scene.  Work super well for reasons that will talk a little bit about okay. So glucose monitors in meters. Like I said these ones on the left are so did their industry standard and you can literally walk into Walgreens in for twenty bucks get one measure your blood glucose. You have to poke your finger is still a very crude technology. You have to draw blood every single time you do it and then there's this new new collection of device called wearable continuous glucose monitors are cgm's continuous glucose monitors and they actually still involve sampling a little bit of liquid. So they involve a puncture also, but it's worn and monitored for about a month or I think it's a week now actually and so a continuous glucose monitor, you know, something that's attached. It's samples of small amount of body fluid. I usually sort of the interstitial fluid not always blood and then has a pretty sophisticated electronics and this is actually something is changing very rapidly. So there's a they're actually he's Wellness Spa  Casters now who wear these things are just constantly know their glucose. And and this is a very rapidly changing technology. I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years anyone who wants to buy a go hack or an athlete or something could wear these I will look into it and that my spouse thought I was crazy and I do it's not easy to do yet. I don't want to wear a continuous glucose why they're not that big then small, but you have to punch you if you're placing not interested, but this is something that's coming along very quickly and are people who argue. We should know our blood glucose all the time. If we really want to approach Wellness interesting idea. They allow you to tell when blood glucose is dropping or increasing which is very valuable for intervention. So continuous glucose monitoring is super valuable. I think we'll stop now cuz it says 3:20 and I will continue with this on Thursday.  Is your fruit? "
