    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started today class. So there's a midterm that's coming up on Monday. There's some practice problems you can find on Piazza and will be posting the solutions to those as well as a homework homework for or posting the solutions tomorrow. Today. We're going to do just kind of like a a little bit of review. And then I'm going to take some questions about the practice midterm and maybe one or two of the problems if we have time, okay?  questions  Okay, so  before we started I kind of wanted to give you a  and updated proof of this thing because I realized last time I proved it. I was using you know, some number Theory things that maybe not everybody was familiar with so let me just go through this proof. I think I have like a much better way to do it that we can all kind of agree upon Okay, so  We're going to do this direction. Let's call this a this B and the Sea so a intersect B is equal to see so it were first going to do this direction a intersect B is a subset of C guy so let X be in a intersect B good and you just write out what that means.  This means that there exists.  integers A&B  Such that.  X is equal to 2 a and X is equal to 2 b r 3 B.  Okay, so  Before I was using this kind of number Theory thing, but another kind of reasonable way to do. This is to think about what what is an integer write an integer.  Can either be even or can be odd it can't be both and it can't be neither right so we can split this up into two cases.  So we'll go like this case one.  B is odd  Okay, so they do Beat It Be is odd. What does that mean? This means that?  X is equal to well, let's actually let's just right B is equal to some let's say to see plus one, right? That's what it means to be on.  So this means X is equal to 3 * 2 C + 1.  Which is equal to what 6C + 3.  Which is equal to 2 to see + 1 + 1.  2 * 3 C + 1 + 1  Cancel. What is that mean about EX?  It's also odd, right?  but I've already said that X is even  thanks for X is even and X is odd.  So X is even and X is odd. This is a contradiction. This implies that b is not odd.  Right because I asked it's like the proof by contradiction. I assumed to be was odd and then I got this contradiction. So that means B can't be odd. Let me be must be even. They'll be case to  B is even  so that means B is equal to 2 C.  And so that means that  X is equal to 3 times to see which is equal to 60 and that will tell you that X is in the set of all 60. That's that she is NZ.  I think this might be a much more reasonable proof for everybody any questions.  Salsa goes to show you that it's not only one way to prove something right there's many ways.  like XP equal to 2 a  that's something that we know is true. Right and then I showed you that if I assume that b is odd, then it contradicts that statement. So you need to put that in there. Yeah.  Where to find the other way around you but we did that in class and that one was a little bit more reasonable.  You guys can do it as an exercise.  other essay other direction  that was that was pretty easy cuz you just say okay, if if it's in the six cset, then that means X is equal to sum 6C. That means X is equal to 3 * 2 * C and those both of those factors give you that it's in both of these other side.  All right.  So let's do a little bit more review. Let's go way back to Week 1 when we're talking about propositions, so  If I wanted to take this and turn it into a compound proposition logic or turn into a logic gate. How would I do it?  these are my only  allowable  Gates  Okay good. So you can do it either by via logical equivalences, or you can actually just write out the truth table, right and then create a DNA or CNF remember dnf and c&f they only use these connectives.  Okay, so good. So let's look at how that works.  Hold on. Let me see something real fast.  Okay.  So we have p and Plies Q.  if and only if  Are implies P. Okay. So how do I change this? How do I change the if and only if into one of those logical connectives?  It's right. It's the it's not exclusive or it's kind of like the negation of exclusive or so. This is equivalent to not P implies Q.  Exclusive or not knowing sorry.  my best friend  cases and how do I resolve those implications?  P and Plies Q. What is that?  Not P or Q. So this is not  not P or  plus not r or p  Oh, sorry. I said or and I wrote an sorry about that.  That's a weird looking or  or is it how would you draw the circuit? Will you have all the ingredients here? So you can  can maybe do that as exercise?  questions about that  you're going to see the circuit.  Okay good.  Okay, so that's what that is. Okay. How would we do it be a truth table?  You can write down all the truth values of Truth combinations.  Just start filling in the gaps. So P implies Q it's true whenever p is true and Q is true or if p is false.  So we have true true. These are going to be the false ones.  And then these are all true.  Then or implies P will look at these rows do the same thing. So true and placed true-false implies true. That's true. True true false true and then Trump has balls. That's false. We have true-false and turn right.  okay, so then the last this last one this this if and only if  Basically, we just look at all of the rows that match and that'll be true.  true true false false false true false  Any questions about that?  Okay, so  This is just what we did. And is that what we got?  Yes.  Okay good.  So from here, how do we build a CNA for a dnf? Let's start with  let's start with a dnf question.  How do you do it? How do you do it? How do we do a DNA?  Evaluating the truth we do.  UNR with the values that are epic road trip yet. We want to land in those Rose. Yeah.  Collect them all with oars. Okay good.  Okay, so what compound proposition describes the first row?  car clickers out get those participation points  Is it working?  Alright, which one is it or is there ants  ants, right  Okay, so it's got to be be.  And in fact be this this proposition, what is that even going to look like if I put it here p&q and our is going to look like it is true with false everywhere else.  Frank and so in that sense when you or all of those troops together, you get the thing that's going to be the dnf and it's going to be like this with a or right or  So that's what it is down there as a circuit.  Would it be fun to draw?  well  It won't be too bad. It's just you know, you could.  you could p q r  All right. So this will kind of be like the first connective would be and like that.  and then the second connected would be p q r and you would  you would send our through a inverter.  So and so forth and then you just do a big or like that.  It's not that it's so complicated. It's just a little tease.  Are the questions or comp you guys? Anybody has a comment?  was that  oh that just means that like  so when we just when we defined input Gates where to find them for two inputs.  Like a or only get two inputs, but I'm saying just for the sake of being able to drive easier we can we can have these input Gates accept more input. Yeah, or else you'll have to like Cascade, you know.  Does anybody have a comment on this sore?  Are you like branch?  Yeah.  You can do it like this.  And you can put more than one thing into a connective if you want.  No.  You have to start from you have to start from the actual variable.  And then and then inverted.  Any other comments?  Okay. How about where they Siena?  What compound proposition describes avoiding the third row?  right, cuz you're now we're trying to avoid the the rose and then we're going to  put them together in some way.  All right, good. Let's see what you guys say here.  quite a bit of  Okay, we're all just jumping on the bandwagon. You guys can't even see what it is anymore.  All right.  Alright, let's let's see kind of how it goes to the third row P is True Q is false and R is true for a for a CNF. What you want to do is kind of like negate those truth values Frank and so we're going to have a  let me just do like this.  I took in order to avoid this row. We need not pee to be true or  Q  or  wait  Que pasa via regular Q. Not not Q  regular Q or  not our  don't you guys got?  Just Clips it right  demorgan's law  Yeah, okay questions about that.  Okay, so let's go so.  Rights of the third the third row is going to be what we just wrote and then we have all these other ones and then and them all together.  Come on now.  To get that CNF. How do you write the thing? I'm just too kind of like what I did before.  p q r  You put P & R threw inverters.  And then you get one of these you got to end.  P q r u put these ones through put only p through an inverter.  and so on and then these all go through a big and  Any comments about that picture?  Okay, let's move on mains.  Domains. What is the domain for the variable Z in the statement there exists a z such that to Z is equal to 10.  Okay.  free clothes here  Let's see if we can get one of them to be more than 50% Lucy we can get it majority.  We all just jumping on the bandwagon.  Who's putting e?  Oh my God.  I wish I put for Eid.  I was going to put something to eat and I got to take a nap.  So are they answer here is D. It's unclear, right?  He always have to say what your domain is. If you don't sometimes it could be kind of implied from you know, the  What else is going on in the problem? You might be able to infer what the domain is, but just this standing alone like that. It's it's unclear.  Remind sometimes or some context clues and you don't actually have to say it every time but most times.  You have to say it.  All right.  Wheels in math have you seen domains?  Yeah, I like a Cartesian right? Like what do you call this?  parabola  so awful parabola  I guess that's okay.  Write like f of x is equal to x squared. What's the domain here?  All real numbers right? I didn't even write it and you knew that right, but it's just because of the context.  Okay, so the domain  so if it's  not  stated  usually  it means  all valid inputs  and I know that that's vague and that would that could mean that you could put complex numbers in there all this kind of stuff. But like I said before it's mostly about finding the Conte the context clues of the problem unless it's otherwise stated explicitly.  Okay.  Alright, let's move on to some other stuff. How about prime numbers?  What is the definition of envying prime?  4 G of x y means X divides, why'd you guys know what that means? That means that?  X is a integer factor of Y.  Or why is a integer multiple of x?  I did all these on mean the same thing.  Okay, let's look at what you guys say here.  All right. This might be a good one for discussion, huh?  Let's go through each one of them or is anybody have any comments or questions?  Pet numbers you divide that number. So it makes me think of you saying, okay.  Okay, let's go. Let's go through them one by one for a that's saying for all X if if x divides Y and X is 1 + x has n or should be or X1 or x's and that's not that's not enough, right?  It doesn't mean that in his prime because you could just sleep with one and that would.  I know this is for all Acts.  Rolex either x / 10 or X is 1 or X attend.  This wouldn't be true for any value of x bigger than an right.  It's just not really true at all.  For any and actually okay. How about be?  This is the one you like.  But this is saying that there exists a Nexus between one and such that.  Yeah exit between 1 and 10 and X does not divide n but that's true for many numbers not necessarily prime numbers, right like for example, if and is equal to 10, right then 7 is in between 1 and 10 + 7 does not divide 10, right? So I'm like, okay, so this is not good.  Okay, how about see there exists an X?  Either one or n? Right? Basically, this is basically kind of restricting to domain to be either one in and X does not divide. And so that's just not even true for any for either one of those right one will always divide and and and will always divide an so this one doesn't really make much sense either. Okay. How about this last one?  for all X  If x divides and then that means that X has to be one or n.  The sounds pretty right, right.  I try to find something like there's like a very minor.  Problem I have with it.  wasn't  well. Just saying that if x divides n then.  it's either one or n and it's it's almost good, but there's a  Yeah.  So and is equal to one is in the set but is 1 Prime.  I know, right?  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know the or is fine here because you can't be what you can't be equal to one end and at the same time.  So this is just saying that if you have a divisor, it's either one or it's an  Yeah. Yeah, I would work.  Oh, that's a good that's a good way to do it. Yeah, replace the or with exclusive or  I can't beat they can't both be true that there that would take care of it.  Was that it was either this time? Yeah.  Addie was very close.  Okay good.  Okay, so let's talk about some proof strategies and then maybe we'll be able to do one of these problems.  and  I don't know. I hope I hope a lot of you had have already started the homework and maybe struggle through a few of the things and this first this first statement might ring true with you, right cuz you know, it's how do you know? How do you know if you're on the right track? How do you know if it's going to actually turn out to be true do trust yourself or maybe you do examples bike plug in 1 through 10 and if they all work then it should probably be true, right?  Did you guys have some some problems with that order?  Oh, yeah, so  yasso  You follow your heart. Yeah, thank you. Just follow your heart. No, there's not there's no good way to do this. I mean that's what mathematicians are, you know research mathematicians that that's what they do. They chase these problems and they don't know if they don't know if it's going to end up in to be true or false right there. Just trying to get an answer so  Saw something determine the logical structure in the main connective. This is good to be able to transform it because once you kind of put it together, you can negate it you can contrapositive that you can do all this manipulations to it without changing the ball in order to prove it.  Okay, I'm in map out possible truth that true strategies direct contrapositive.  So here is a sample of an idea. These are called closure proofs. So here's the  here's the definition of a set is closed under an operation exactly when  whatever whatever input you choose to put into the operation from the set. The output is also in the set. Okay, so what are some examples of this?  The set of positive rational numbers is closed under multiplication. What does that mean? That means that if I take two positive rational numbers and I multiply them will I get a positive rational number.  Okay, the set of prime numbers is closed under addition.  False. Okay. How would you show that?  Okay good. So you could just do a counterexample.  Okay, what about the set of irrational numbers is closed under division.  False why?  Alright, what was it / e is 1 okay.  What about the set of rational numbers is closed under subtraction?  Best route to ring queso exercises to do because of the proofs are pretty straightforward. So it's proved this top one the set of positive rational numbers is closed under multiplication. So what we want to show is that  if x is in q  and why is in queue then?  XY is in q  do I say positive? Thank you.  Okay, thank you. So then.  Let X Y bien que, so that means that X is equal to P over q and Y is equal to R / T where P Q R and T are all positive integers and Q and T are nonzero, right? I guess they're all nonzero.  So that's your assumption then x times Y is equal to PR over QT where PR and qt are both positive integers.  If I could just take that out, right cuz if it's positive then is fine there for XY is in Q. I mean it's a very simple proof but you know you get the structure and it might be a good exercise for you guys to try to do that.  If you have an irrational number and you add it to its like in Austin like a negative review of negative rational numbers.  At home or not.  Yeah.  You could.  That's not always.  irrational times irrational  you'd have to prove that.  Right, right. I was thinking zero minus the irrational.  But that's also pretty easy to prove. But like if you're talking about for your homework that you can just assume that negative irrational number is irrational then it's  Additive inverse is also irrational. You can assume that that's fine.  Okay, so proof strategies we can just go over these.  bright  implications  bright  Ki cases those kind of things by contradiction if you have just some statement than to the idea is you negate the statement and you assumed that that negated statement is true.  Then you do all these logical steps and you hope that at the end you'll get some sort of contradiction in the contradiction usually is of the form.  Something is true, and it's false or something is even and it's odd or something is positive and it's negative. But you get these kind of things that contradict each other.  Okay, so for the exam strategy.  Read all the questions when you get the exam start with the ones, you know how to do just to let you make sure you can manage your time right read the directions carefully.  Pace yourself and ask questions if needed. So does anybody has anybody have any questions about any problems you want to see presented?  Which one?  the triangle one  All right.  so  Okay, so the triangles were talking about triangle numbers, right? And so basically  if let's say my  imports are x 3 x 2 x 1 x 0 right so I could write down all of the bits the zeros and ones bb16 rose, right?  Turn on going to do that save a little bit of time.  the question is saying  the design a circuit that takes a 4-bit fix integer as input and outputs true or one right if this number is a triangle number and false or 0 if it's not. Okay. So really what I have to do is pinpoint which numbers are triangle numbers, which ones are they? Well 0.001 so that should be true or one but let's just say one.  2 output  what was the other 1003 so that's what one one right that should be 106 is 011.  0 right  + 10 is what?  1010  15 so what's that?  One one one one. So that's also one. Okay. So those are the ones that are one everything else is 0 so what what and a normal form should we use?  conjunctive versus disjunctive disjunctive dnf  so the  so what would that look like?  well  You can do X3 or Sumi not X3.  And not X2 and not X1.  And x0 right or and so on. Is there another way that can that we can do this without using a disjunctive normal form?  I was not X3 not X2 and then just text Euro.  203-200-2990  Okay. Wait, so let me write that out. So for these two you can combine that to not X3 and not x 2 and x 0.  Fried Chicken take-out a connective like that.  Okay, and then what?  these two  mission  X3  And X2 like that X1.  Okay, good. And then what about this one?  Maybe just write it all out.  not X3 and  X2 X1 and not extra case of that simplifies it a bit.  that doesn't account for  It's too and every are different than that's not the case, right? So we need something else, right we need and  X2 exclusive or x 0  I don't know if and only if  I'm sorry, I did not.  What was it?  Okay good.  You don't think so. Cuz the first option I have I have five of those closets.  Guaranteed to get a ride for sure.  I'm just seeing if we can like use these kind of logical equivalence has to help out.  Does that help your question or did I just make it more?  Does that give you a pathway to figure it out? Okay, good. That's kind of what I'm hoping.  Yeah, but that one might be a very  yeah, I guess I would like for you to try to get it down to its simplest form. We might even ask you to do it with a certain number of connectives a certain number of circuits.  Well, you put these together with oars, so.  Excuse me horse.  One thing you could maybe do here. Here's another.  thing is that  these two share  Needs to Sharon Ott X3, right?  and tell one way that  write one way that we did it before was too kind of split it up between like one of the variables likes a X3. So what happens if x X3 is false and what happens if x 3 is true and you can do it that way. I might be kind of a helpful.  now these are all whores because  so the idea is that those those are clauses that we wrote they're going to be true in those rows only and false everywhere else.  Pranks we want to order them together in order to get the trues and all the rows.  right  Yeah, cuz you're going to order them together.  I will post it Solutions tomorrow. Give it a shot though. See if you can see if you can crunch it down even farther.  This is not the most simplest version.  Calculator Etsy like log base 2017 or whatever and might I would usually just do like log base 2 of that number.  So one way to do it is to just like memorize all of the all of the powers.  I'll be hard.  Is it okay if I don't usually since I like you were foremost I have like a to memorize that's like with his phone number. I usually like what's like the biggest thing I can subtract from it. "
