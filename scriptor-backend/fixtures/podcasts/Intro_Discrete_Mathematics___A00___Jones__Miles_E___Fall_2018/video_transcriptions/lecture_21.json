So we'll do a quick review about what does it mean to be one to one onto bijective?  Then we're going to use these three properties. We're going to use the properties of functions to Define how to compare cardinalities of sets.  Then we're going to talk about different kinds of cardinalities finite infinite and stuff like that. And I don't know if we'll really get the kids were stagno's ation argument today, but that would be coming that's going to be  a way in which we show  constructively that there is a set that has a different cardinality or there's two sets that are both infinite sets and they have different cardinalities. Okay. So we're going to talk about that. There's more than one type of infinity that's kind of where we're going with this.  Okay. So from last time let's go through like all of the major function definitions. Okay. So the first one is well-defined. What does it mean for a function to be well defined it means that.  The output is unambiguous. Okay, it means that every for every input into your function. The output of the function is in the is one element in the codomain.  Okay, so what kind of things are forbidden to do in a in a function? Well, first of all.  You need an arrow coming out of each.  Input value. So one thing that's forbidden to do is to map something outside of your codomain, right? Everything has to land in your codomain. The other thing that's forbidden to do is you can't map to two different things. Okay, a function will only have one unique output not anymore. Not anyway, and that's  that comes from  this part of the definition questions  wealthfront  All right.  onto  what does it mean to be on to the first of all you need to have a well-defined function and if that well defined function maps to every element of the codomain then it's on to this is pretty simple pranks just that you didn't miss anything.  Good questions about that.  Stop this function to the right you missed a zero. There's nothing that match 2-0 there for this function is not.  Hunter  this song  What if I took this same function?  But now the codomain is just one.  Is it on to now?  Yes, right. There is dependent on how you define what your codomain is.  Text questions about that.  Okay good.  Okay, so then the last one is 1210. Maybe we'll talk about bijections to 121 means that there's no duplicate images for every effort everything in the codomain either. It does not get map to at all or it gets map to buy one. But only one element in the domain.  Every element in the codomain has at most one Arrow coming in queso this this is not allowed because there are two arrows any questions about that.  Answer those are all the things and then bijection is just based on one to one and onto k121 Plus on 2 equals bijection.  And these are some synonyms to bijection one-to-one correspondence bijection invertible.  Okay good. So, let's move on cardinality. We right right absolute value signs or vertical signs around a set that informally what it's saying. Is that the size of the set? Okay.  We're going to use this term cardinality because once we get in two sets of infinite size, we kind of have to use the formal definition of cardinality. We can't rely on our own intuition. Okay, what sets are just finite, you know, your intuition of the size should be kind of should correspond to the definitions that we do here, but when sets are infinite then your intuitions might not line up.  Okay, so the set 2 4 6 has the same cardinality as a set 7 8 9 and will show you how to prove that in a little while. How should we talk about the sizes of infinite sets? The integers are an infinite set and the reals are infinite set. Are we going to say that?  How we going to reconcile this? Right? There's no there's no way that you can count all the elements of each of the set. So you can't use that method. Okay, so let me just kind of think about what are some ways that we could actually Define, okay?  so  what do you notice about z&r Z is a subset of r?  right  So if Z is a subset of our and actually it is a proper subset.  write 0 as a proper subset of our so are we going to say maybe the cardinality of Z is strictly less than the cardinality of our  I mean you could see how that would be like a  a natural conclusion, right?  And I mean intuitively with finite sets. That would be true. Right but now we have infinite Center. Okay, so I'm just trying to brainstorm about how we could do this. These are not actually the definitions that were going to use. We're going to come up with those a little bit later.  Josie subset of our does that imply that Z is less than r  Okay, so this would be one.  Okay. I know the way to reconcile this is what if we just say I said is if a set is infinite then it's infinite.  Z or s a z  and our  are both  infinite  so  Z is equal to R.  Putting question marks by then because it's like these are different ways. It's not it's not really like that. They're wrong ways to do it. It's just that the way that we are going to learn to do it. The way that mathematicians have accepted to Define cardinality is going to be the way we do it in a minute, but these are all you know.  Find find ways to think about them another way. You can say it. Is that Z and r  are not finite  so  D & R  are not defined  I'm just trying to reconcile the fact that their infinite.  Do you guys like any of these better than the other?  You like the top one the best?  the second one  any other comments you guys want to make  I mean if we just said that there are not too fine, then we could skip this whole chapter in the book, right? Is anybody like that one?  No, it's all.  The way that we're actually going to Define how to compare cardinalities. It's sort of a mixture between one and two between the two first and we'll see how that works in a minute.  Okay.  Le just to remind you guys  these are  not the definition of we're using  Okay, good. Alright, so these are ones that we could have used. This is how we're going to Define how to compare sets. We're going to say.  Set a is equal to the cardinality of a is equal to the cardinality of B.  if  there is a bijection.  F from A to B  Okay. Now remembered I buy Jackson is a one-to-one correspondence. It's one to one and onto it basically means that I'm going to map the whole set from A to B to the whole set of be and I'm going to map every element to a unique element.  Or I'm not ever going to map to elements to one.  So this is real a really good way of defining equality of cardinalities, right? Because it matches our intuition right if the sets have the same number of elements, then you can always make a bijection.  Any questions about that?  Stop. This one has five elements. That one has five elements. This is a bijection between them. This is not the only bijection you can make another bijection where you just kind of map 1 to a 2 to be 3 to see forwarded the potty or any other kind of jumbled but notice that is one to one and it's onto it's a bijection there for those two sets of equal cardinality.  Okay, any questions about that?  This is going to be our definition of  of this statement of this notation  Okay.  So beyond finite sets why don't we use this definition of equality to tell us if two infinite sets have equal cardinality K. Is that fair?  Okay good.  So what other definitions could we have used while we could have used the definition sort of based on those three bullet points we had.  but these are not as  well  What is what is a good reason why we don't use these?  I guess these are harder to kind of deal with rent. It's easier to deal with something. If you have like a very formal definition of what it is and we can base it on something for him. Okay, so we're going to base equality of cardinalities on something very formal that there is a bijection between them.  Okay.  Let's move on from there.  Okay, so with this.  When equipped with this way of showing equality, which of these two sets are have equal cardinality.  And remember that n is the set of non-negative numbers.  I remember z+, right.  Is the set of all positive numbers?  and remember 01 star  anybody remember what this is?  Set of all finite length binary strings, right?  Okay, so  Okay, good. We have a little bit of  Uncertainty here, right and maybe that uncertainty comes from thinking about infinite sets like you would with finite sets and let's go through each one of these answers before we before we talk about Oliver.  Okay. So the first one Z is equal to n?  Okay. Well, we know that n  Is a proper subset of Z?  And so if we use those bullet point that I said before then it would be easy to show that one is a strict subset of the other right? It's the same with this one.  I guess Z Z Plus.  Is a strict subset of n e plus does not contain zero and end us contains you.  Shaw  If we're doing it for using that weird definition than sure one's going to be strictly less than the other but with this other definition, I'm going to show you that both A and B are true.  Okay.  Now, what about C?  also true  You think it's also true?  Can you make a bijection between all integers and all binary strings?  Yes, okay, so that's true, too.  Okay, so why are we saying?  Why are we saying he shouldn't be D?  There you go.  Okay, we're going to revisit Oh shoot what happened there?  Oh, no.  What did I do?  I think that's fine. Okay, we're going to revisit these in a minute. Okay to come back.  Okay. So the next thing we want to do is Define what it means to be less than or equal to and greater than or equal to K. The cardinality of a is less than or less than or equal to the cardinality of this means. There's a one-to-one function from HB. This is going to be the definition of less than or equal to when we talk about cardinalities, okay?  Definition of that and then a is greater than or equal to be if there is an onto function from A to B cardinality. Okay. So on the homework you may have seen that we want you to use these definitions to prove these relationships.  It turns out that it's true that they that less than less than or equal to and greater than or equal to you can kind of flip them around but we don't want you to use that fact. We want me to use just these definitions in order to prove those things.  Okay, these are great definitions. One of the reasons that they're good is that  When when you have a one-to-one and onto function, then you have less than or equal to and greater than or equal to which means that they're equal right? And that's exactly how we defined it them to be evil.  Okay, so which one of the following is true here?  Which of the following is always true?  and see that  okay.  There were saying okay. Yes. This is always true. Let's prove it.  Okay. I guess I want to say one more thing before we proved it.  This is what I was saying before if a is less than or equal to b and a is greater than or equal to be then pay is equal to be this is the Cantor Schroeder Bernstein theorem and actually seems like it's a very simple theorem, doesn't it?  It's not easy. It's actually kind of a messy proof.  But we're not going to go through it. We just have to accept that. It's true vine.  Okay. So let's prove that quicker question. If a is a subset of B, then the cardinality of a is less than or equal to the cardinality of be. Okay, so  What we want to show is this but now we have to show it using the definition of less than or equal to the definition of less than or equal to means that there's a one-to-one function from A to B.  Okay. So here's the proof Define f from A to B to b f of a is equal to a  Okay. Now all I have to do is show you that this function is well-defined and one-to-one and then we're done, right?  So why is this function well defined?  okay, so every element of a has an image and their images just for that same element, right and how do you know that that element will always be in b  Exactly because a is a subset of P.  the picture you can think about maybe is that you have like a here and here's be  with a as a subset  and the function is just going to map all of a to a  It's clear that it's well-defined, right everything is to find all the functions. The function is defined on the whole set of a they all going to be and it's also kind of clear that it's one to one. But let's do a formal proof of why it's one to one.  The supports supposed to add the contradiction that it's not one to one. That means that there are two elements.  A&A Prime that are not equal but their function values are equal right? That's what it means to not be one to one.  But now you can see that this could never happen because of the way that we defied act right by the definition of f we get that half of a is equal to a and F of a prime is equal to a prime. So then we get that a is equal to a prime which contradicts the fact that a  Are there any questions about that?  Sure.  Let's have an example of a function. That's not well defined.  I know sometimes if you see so many examples that are correct. It's kind of hard to imagine an example. That's not correct, right?  Okay, so  How about this function that takes?  1 2 3  to let's say  345  An app of X is equal to let's say X plus one because half of one what's it called this Saturday? And thus it be half of one is not in the codomain.  Every single image of the function has to pass the Fallen to the codomain.  That kind of cleared up a little.  Every single image of this function will fall into the codomain because a is a subset of B.  Pretty good.  Okay. So let's talk about another term another vocab word countable sets for countable sets have to fall into two categories finite sets and countably infinite sets Okay, so finite sets are all countable a finite set is just  When a cardinality is equal to end. What does it mean? When is equal to end that means it has exactly and a different elements in it. So, I think we all can  Rapper heads around what it means to be a finite set. Okay, countably infinite set means that the set has the same cardinality as the positive integers.  Okay.  sambucus to a few examples  Informally it can be listed out and we'll see kind of how that works in a minute.  We're going to we're going to build a hierarchy of Infinities and it turns out that the countably infinite sets is the smallest type of Infiniti Infiniti of the integers are the Infinity of the positive integers is really the smallest Infinity. You can have Okay, so let's move on  What are some countably infinite sets here?  Well the empty set of course.  What's the cardinality of the empty set?  0 good  what's the cardinality of this chat?  to write because it contains -1 + 1  what's the cardinality of the power set of 1 2 3 anybody know?  8 good  Okay, and the cardinality of the positive integers, so this is an infinite set. So there is no number that we can put their often times. You'll see it written as  and I tried very hard I can never drive correctly, but  Is there a where is the desert?  Does Microsoft have a equation editor for this symbol?  Does anybody know what the symbol is?  Alex how did use anybody know how to draw it?  It's a symbol.  It should be at the very bottom of all the symbols.  It's just challenging. Oh, here it is.  I think that's it.  Okay quote. Sorry. Sorry about that.  Oh, there it is.  Good. Sorry about that.  Out of Sub-Zero. That's the  that's what we call this smallest Infinity.  Okay. So another some more examples of countably infinite sets are the set of all odd positive integers set of all integers themselves. We're going to show that one in a minute set a positive rationals negative rationals the set of all rational with so it will show that also  Oh remember that the power set?  We showed this. I think the power set of a  set a  the cardinality of the power set of a is equal to 2 to the A.  Okay, the set of non-negative integers the set of all bit strange we talked about that one.  Even the set of all Z Crosby we're going to talk about that too. Okay, so let's move on.  Okay, I don't want to prove to you that the set of all integers is countably infinite. Now when you first see this you might say well the set of all integers is a superset of the set of positive integers, right? So you might think that there are more integers than there are positive integers.  Frank that kind of  Make sentence in a certain way, but now I'm going to show you that there's a bijection between the positive integers and all the integers and I claimed that this is it by Jackson dysfunction here.  So just to remind you, what we're trying to do is we're trying to show that the set of all.  integers  the cardinality of the set is equal to the cardinality of the set.  1 2 3  these are actually equal ones not smaller than the other.  Okay, so I need to make a I need to make a function that goes from all integers two positive integers. And the way I'm going to do that is if the integer is a non- then map it to two and plus one in at the end of her is negative then map it to two two times negative and  So it's like napping all the positive integers to odd and all the even integers all the negative integers to even say so in a way you're sort of like zipping them together and making this big list.  We'll look at that list in a little bit more detail about what I want to do is go over the proofs.  Just so that you guys are more comfortable with seeing these types of proofs and you can do these proofs yourself. Okay. So in order to show that this is a bijection. We need to show three things. It's well-defined. It's one to one and it's on  So let's start with well-defined.  This function is well-defined. Why well since 2 and plus one is in Z whenever n is greater than or equal to 0 to 1 + 1 is always going to be a positive integer when and is greater than equal to zero, so that's good.  2 times negative and is always a positive integer when n is less than 0.  Any questions about that?  Okay, why is it one to one?  So let's do kind of the contradiction suppose. It's not one to one. Then there exists some these two elements and an M that are not equal, but they map to the same integer.  Is it exactly the same setup we did for the other proof to show something is one to one?  Okay, so and is not equal to M and M are both integers. So let's split it up into three cases. Let's suppose first that both N&M are positive.  Or non- non- then you use this rule for both of them. So then you get to m + 1 is equal to 2 m + 1 you do a little algebra. Can you show that Anne has to be equal to M. So there's a contradiction there.  Same thing happens when you assume that they're both negative.  Then you then you use this rule for both of them and you get two times negative m is equal to 2 times negative end and use a little bit of algebra conclude that Anne has to be equal to him.  Okay, the third case is that suppose that n is less than M 0 and his greater than equal to 0 then you have a even number is equal to an odd number  That can happen.  I guess you could do case for where there are there. Always there there swap the other way, but it's the same thing.  Any questions about this?  Okay. Good. It's one to one.  now let's show that it's on to  onto proof begs the question does everything in the codomain get map to does everything does every positive integer get mapped to  So suppose an is in G+ suppose and is in the codomain now, I'm going to construct something in the domain that half of that number is equal to in case one and it's odd right if n is odd then is equal to 2 k + 1.  for some positive integer k  So when you plug in K into F. It's positive rights we use this and that's okay is equal to end.  because half of K is equal to  2K + 1  Basically, what I'm saying is that if n is odd then plug in a positive number if n is even right then is equal to 2 K for some positive integer K. So then f of negative K is equal to 2 times negative negative k2k.  every integer get maps to  All evens to me every positive integer gets map to all the even ones all the odd ones out any questions.  Okay good. So now that concludes the proof and we know that the is equal to 2 C plus.  Okay, so that's good. I want to give you an alternate way to to prove these cardinale's are equal because it's not always so simple to come up with this nice form of the of the  function  okay, so an equal and another way to prove that two card into a better than the cardinality of one set is countably infinite is to find a a nice list of all the elements. Okay. So another way to prove that a set a is countable is by providing a way to list out all the elements of a  and so the way I proposed to list them out is to start at 0 right and then go negative one positive one negative to positive to negative 3 and you can be sure that every single negative integer is in this list.  drink  and why is this showing that there that is equal to the cardinality of the counting numbers of the positive numbers because the bijection is just half of n is equal to whatever numbers in position in.  Half of 1 is equal to 0/2 of 2 is equal to -1/2 of 1/3 is equal to 145.  So bye-bye putting them in a list essentially what you're doing is mapping them to the the integers counting up from 1.  It turns out that this is the inverse function from the other side.  Okay. So this this is like the main way that you're going to show that sets are countably infinite.  Okay.  Let's look at another clicker question, which of the following is not true.  If a and b are both countable in a union B is countable A & B are both countable in a intersect B is countable.  Can you be a both comfortable than a cross B is countable a is countable then pfas County.  When out of the above, are they all uncountable?  Okay, so there's a little bit of uncertainty here.  We have a few more minutes left some let's go through the proof of a so, let's think about them each in turn. They will go through the proof be actually.  This one should follow from something else we've done.  a intersect B is a subset of a remember that  Right and we showed we proved that whenever one set is a subset of another set. The cardinality of the first set is less than or equal to the cardinality of the Second Ascent.  Therefore if a is countable then a union B had to be helped. Okay. So this one kind of follows from what we've done before.  All right Let's do let's do parte. Let's see this if any beer both countable then a union B is countable. I'm going to attempt to  convince you of this.  Okay, stop.  I'll call it justification.  Okay, so a  and be  can both be  Listed, right member week said that's another way to prove that they're countable. So if they're countable that can be listed out. Okay, so let's let's say that their list or so a can be listed like this A1 A2 A3.  Before and so on and be can be listed like this P1 P2 P3 P4 and so on. Okay. So what I'm going to attempt to do is to list out a union B, okay.  Will that work?  Yeah, what is a is infinite then you'll never reach the end of a and you'll never you'll never list any of the elements of be so what's a way that we can list out the elements of a and b.  Okay good. So like just a zipper them together.  Cancel a union B can be listed as a one.  B18 to be to  all the elements will appear in the list and  Any questions about that?  Okay good. So let's go back. So that's good. Okay. How about a cross B?  Now we have like think about member a Crosby is like the set of ordered pairs you can sort of think about them is like now you're going into a different dimension.  So let's do the justification of this one.  Okay, so it can be listed.  A1 A2 A3 A4  bb1 P2 P3 before  Okay. So, how am I how am I going to list all of the ordered pairs? Well, I can start with a one right a One V one.  a 1 b 2  A1 B3  And list out all day ones.  Are you running into the same problem here? Right. So this is not a good way to do it. So we're going to have to find a different way. Does anybody have any ideas?  Okay good. So yeah, the idea is to kind of list all of the  pears  so that their index indices don't exceed a certain value.  Let's look at it another way.  You can.  Draw them in a grid, right?  A-1 B-1  I'm thinking about like Matrix notation. So I'm starting from the top and going down a 1 b 2.  A1 B3  That goes that way then down you get a to be one.  A to be to not be one, right?  A3  B1 thank you.  Pay for B1 write me what goes here A2 B2.  A 2 B 3 and so on right so you like fill it out like a matrix. Now all of the elements will appear somewhere in that Matrix, right? And so one way to order them is to do the kind of like the zig zag pattern.  Right start here and then go up here. So it will be one.  2  3  and then maybe go over here for  5  sex  7  can I go like this?  All through. All right, you'll never miss any of the elements and now you put them in a nice list.  Any questions about that?  How would you explain going in a zigzag pattern you just say it? Yeah, you just say right all the elements in a matrix and then go in a zigzag pattern.  No one actually what you're doing. If you notice is you are listing out all the elements that have that never exceed a maximum sum of indices. What am I trying to say?  no, not some of indices maximum of the indices Okay, so  Play the max of the indices. So if the max is one how many how many ordered pairs have the max of their indices being one will only one a One V one right? What if the max is too then? You have 3 A1 B2.  A2 B1 and A2 B2  and then how many have Max 3 that's also going to be a finite amount so you can list them out kind of with this.  Way to which end up being sort of the same.  Okay think that's so I guess I have one more question for you guys.  Which of the following statements is true? There are strictly more rational numbers and positive integers there a strictly more rational numbers than rational numbers between 0 and 1 they're strictly more rational numbers between 0 and 1 then positive integers.  Okay now just I just want to remind you there are an infinite amount of rational numbers in between 0 and 1.  And there are infinite number of rational numbers in between every single integer.  Okay, good. So  kind of going I guess I have a few more minutes.  Okay, good. We have some.  Some nice, I guess we're jumping on the bandwagon for all of the above.  Okay, all of the above, I guess it makes a lot of sense right? There are strictly more rational numbers and positive integers.  Strictly more rational. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to say all of the above.  So on Monday, we're going to see that it's none of the above.  Okay.  Alright. See you guys. Have a nice weekend. "
