What are you guys what's on your minds final exam, right?  So you have yours where are we lecture are lecture B.  We're at okay. So our exam is on Tuesday 11:32 to 3229 going to be in this room.  You can bring a pencil or pen your ID one side of one standard page of notes.  And any questions about that?  There is a review session on Sunday.  I posted on Piazza. So you guys can look at that for the details. There are also some practice questions for you to practice for the final.  And that'll basically be the topic of the review session. And today we're going to do some review also Okay, so  Studying for the exam. Here's the review session good we put it on there.  There's a Time review quizzes while will still all be open for studying.  The next review quiz will be available tonight will be due at the end of the week.  So look at the extra problems in the book from the on the website, look at old homeworks, especially the questions you had trouble with.  The old exams those types of things.  Are all good places to study and the practice problems that we posted will post the solutions this weekend to questions about that.  Okay, so let's kind of list out the topics that we kind of we did this this quarter.  so we talked a little bit about algorithms not much but enough to  to understand what is like a pseudocode and how to follow through an algorithm follow the steps in those kinds of things. We talked a little bit about greedy algorithms. Those are kind of  Class of algorithms that's a little bit simpler than others. Then we got it to number systems different bases integer operations.  Then logic and predicates quantifiers.  Proof strategies sets induction recursion functions carnality and we ended up with binary relations and modular arithmetic just slides that go over each topic a little bit would like an example. So I guess I'll just get started we have today and Friday to kind of talk about review so you can interrupt me and ask me more questions about stuff that we've done in the class. If there's something that you wanted to kind of that you're still struggling with if you wanted to ask about then we can we can talk about that too. But if you don't have any questions at this moment, I'll just get started with what we prepared.  So so what do we really expect for you to be able to do with algorithms?  The main thing is to basically Trace through a pseudocode and if you forget what a pseudocode is, it's just kind of like a code in like a mathematician's language where you don't really care so much about all of the nitty-gritty punctuation and all the stuff that you might have to for Java or C or something like that and you can kind of abbreviate certain processes. You don't have to be super.  Rigid about how you describe what the computer is doing?  Okay, so that's pseudocode then there's the high-level description of the algorithm which is more of a how does it how does it work in general? And how how does how does it get you to the answer? It doesn't really tell you the nuts and bolts of what's happening in the processor.  Okay.  It's nice to know if a algorithm will terminate.  use some classical algorithms greedy algorithms and  greedy approach. Okay. So let's look at an example. So here's a pseudocode.  4change algorithm  wait, where's my clicker thing?  Okay, here's a greedy for a change think so.  imagine that you're given  C1 C2  C3 all the way up to see our okay, you're given like are different values of coins, right? Then this algorithm will take an integer n and it will  it will it will assign values for D4 D1 D2 D3 to tell you how many of each coin you need in order to to make change for an  Okay, so I assume that RS3 C1 C2 C3 are all 10 5 + 1 what DIY values result from the input and is equal to 21 in width using this algorithm.  Oh, did I not start it yet. Sorry. I was waiting for you guys to click in.  Hey, so we have a little bit of uncertainty here.  That's kind of what kind of see what happens here. Okay.  Let's Trace through the code for this particular example. So this this portion here, what are you doing?  You just like initializing them all to be 0 right?  Okay, so we start out with n and then while and is greater than zero and then what we're going to do is we're going to decrement in every time and until it gets down to zero right? So  Well, I well and is greater than zero then you test each one of those Deez right for I from 1 to R.  if a man is greater than equal to CI then  basically, you you add one of those coins the CI value coin and you decrease and  song  in the first step, right we have an is equal to what do we say 21, right and then we take is equal to 1 2 and 3, right or we keep we keep on going until we get something.  so  when I is equal to one, right and is greater than or equal to see one, right? What is C1 in this place? 10. So let's actually let's do it step by is equal to 1 then n is greater than or equal to see one, right which is 10.  21 is greater than equal to 10. So that means that D1 is going to be implemented by one and and is going to be decremented by 10.  So that's going to be 21-10, which is 11.  That kind of makes sense for that first step.  Okay. So this is where this algorithm is, like kind of weird where it might be sort of different than what you would expect it to do notice that I'm still in the for loop. I haven't escaped the for Loop. So now for the for Loop goes from equals 1/2 equals to okay. So now I'm in is equal to 2. I have 11  Is greater than or equal to?  C2 which is 5  And so then I say D2 is equal to 1 and N is equal to 2 and -5 which is 6.  Kind of weird, right?  Then we go into eyes equal to 3.  we have five is an excuse me 6  is greater than or equal to C3 which is one Saudi 3 is going to be one and and is going to be equal 2 N -1, which is 5  Okay, so that's like the first.  The first Passage through the for Loop. Okay, then we go back up to the wild Loop and we check is in still greater than equal still greater than 0 yes at this point and is equal to 5.  So then when you go back through the for Loop, I'm not going to do each step again. But when I is equal to 1/5 is is too small for the ten cent coin right? It's equal to the five cent coin so you so you increment D2 again, and then you're at zero, so there's no one's to use so you get to see  Kind of like a weird way of doing it.  You know, if I were to if I were to make change, I probably like try to get rid of all the biggest coins first and then give the smaller coins when I couldn't when I ran out of big coins that kind of thing. Just does it in a different way any questions  okay, so next clicker question is  Is this algorithm finite does it always terminate?  Yes, it terminates for any end know it never terminates for any N. I guess we can kind of get rid of that one because we already saw that it terminated for at least one.  No, there's some end for which it runs forever.  Okay, good song for saying yes, it terminates for any end. And why is that the case because you start with some n and you keep on subtracting so that's going to happen if  If they're actually you can actually make change, right?  What if there's a what if there are coins that won't actually make change for n what will happen?  It'll go on forever. So let me just write that out. So.  If it is possible.  to make  and since from C1 through CR then  it will terminate.  If it is not possible.  Then it will run forever.  The answer is C.  Okay, so it's only a if there's actually a solution if it actually is a there is a way to do it.  Yeah, so, oh we assumed that yeah, you're right.  Thank you.  So for this particular example, it will always terminate but for a more General set of coins, it won't.  good observation  questions  Okay.  Let's go on to the next topic number systems integer representations. Okay. So what do we expect you to know how to convert between bases for 1?  the algorithms that we talked about how to  how do you use algorithms to convert between bases?  And then we talked about how to relate those for integer operations to bitwise Boolean operations. And then you can use if though if you're just using bitwise Boolean operations those correspond to these Gates that we were talking about the x or Gates and bit shifts.  If you kind of remember when we did that kind of thing and then the dip in the mod operation operators were necessary for some of those algorithms.  When you divide and you take the money and then we got back to mod later.  Okay, let's do an example.  In what base does 1123 * 3113 equal 35 to 3520000 121?  Smoke a lot of people are saying base 8, let's go through the other bases and eliminate them. Okay. Why can it not be base-7?  Okay good. So a clue to do these is to look at the rightmost digit, right? So I have the rightmost digit here is 3 * 3 is equal to one bank. So that means that whatever value 3 * 3 is it's going to be equal to 1 mod b  right  Do you guys see why?  so 9 is going to be equivalent to one mod be so what are the possible values of B such that nine is is congruent to 1 mod b  Okay, so be it could be beagle to 2.  4  9 is 1 mod 4 or 8.  Those are the only possibilities.  3 questions about that  Okay, so can we eliminate two and four?  Why?  Because why?  Because 5 is here, right?  So there's like a digit in there. That's that's too big for 2 and 4.  Okay, so the only real possibility is 8 and in order to verify it, you could just kind of do the multiplication yourself questions.  Turns out it is 8.  If I did my math, correct, I think it is a so it was supposed to be eight.  questions about that  I'm sorry.  No.  Because 3 * 3 is 9 and 9 is equivalent to 9 mod 1717 psych too big.  Okay, let's get to propositional logic a lot of stuff to read but it's just basically trying to tell you what we expect you to know about propositional logic. Let's just going to go through.  quickly, so logical connectives  write all of those things and or xor implies all that stuff translating English to logic and logic to English truth tables.  write using  transferring formulas to truth tables truth tables back to formulas using CNF Indian at all that kind of stuff Converse contrapositive inverse look at two formulas and make sure that they are see if they are equivalent or not equivalent.  make circuits  Let's see de Morgan's laws double- distributive laws. Ologies contradictions.  satisfiable  Okay.  What's look at an example?  which of these following compound propositions is logically equivalent to not  P implies not Q implies r  You can take out some paper if you like.  Just remind you of kind of the the different ways we've done these problems one is to use well-known logic identities to sort of simplify them. The other way is to use truth tables.  Oh that was just to remind you of what how to how implies works.  I'm kind of all over the place here.  All right.  So see if you guys can work it out between each other.  something like this could totally be on the exam also, so  Yeah.  Okay, so I guess we're kind of hovering around C.  Okay. Now everybody's jumping on the bandwagon. Okay. See anybody want to make any comments?  Did you guys use logical?  identities or truth tables question  I would say start with trying to simplify them quickly, you know, and if you're simplification matches any of them, then you're done, but with these types of problems, it's kind of hard because  You might have to like simplify both things down to make sure that they're equivalent and you might have to do that a lot. So if you make a truth table one thing you can do is you can start eliminating things, right if it doesn't match your truth table.  So I would make a truth table.  Frank p q r  True false. True true false false. Is this what you guys did?  false true true false true false false false true false false false  so  Basically, if they're equivalent you want each one of those Rose to be the same, right?  So did anybody.  compute this  P implies not Q. Let's do that one first, so  Troon Place ball. So that's false we have false.  Troon Place true that's true and true and then you have true all the way down.  right  So P implies not Q implies.  AR  Right, we have false if it's if the hypothesis is false, then the whole thing is true.  Can't then we have true implies true.  This is it should be a false here.  So true and prize true, that's true true and false false true implies, true true and false false. True. True false false.  So there's that and then you just take the negation of that to get the other way.  The negation of right the thing we get false false false, true false true-false true.  now  let me go down here to do see and make sure that it's the same pqr.  True true true true false false false false. We have true true false false. True. True false false.  true false true  So what's Q or r?  I think we get true true. True false. True. True true false. Okay good and what is not and not r  Okay, so not pee and not are means that.  They both have to be false in order for that thing to be true.  So you get what?  false false false false false false  false true-false true  and then q and R implies not-p and not are  I know I'm getting into the other thing. Sorry about that. So true and Plies balls. That's false. Okay, Trump ice balls. That's false true-false. That's false false false. That's true true applies false. That's false true-false true. That's true true and false false false true-false true is true equivalent comments. I know that there's a lot of work to go into it. But this is a way that you can like definitely solve this thing. Did anybody solve it in a different way using equivalences?  Okay any questions about this?  Doing it with equivalences. Sure. Let me just make myself a little bit more room.  Okay, what was the first one? It was not peeing python cubic a not P implies not Q implies are right.  Okay. So remember what remember this identity this is really helpful p.m. Plies Q. Is anybody know how to change this into Anne's indoors and not  not-p  or cute good song  So this portion here becomes not P or not Q.  that implies are  so then this guy here is so we have this not we have not not P or not Q or R and then you can simplify that down to using demorgan's law that's going to be p and Q.  or are  if you eat the other colors off.  No, I what I was going to do was simplify this down and then simplify the other one down and show their equal. Yeah.  You guys can maybe do that as exercise on you.  I don't know which one's more tedious.  They both are not very fun, right? Okay.  Okay, moving on to more logic stuff predicates quantifiers for all there exists.  Justified definition translating English sentences to these predicate.  Figure out how they work with Boolean operators, like negation and all that kind of stuff implies all that sort of thing. Talk about their donate domain.  And nested quantifiers, right? Like if you have a for all and there exists back in the thing evaluate the truth tables. Okay. So let's look at an example.  Which which domains is this statement true?  So good way to do this is to translate what it is to what it is into English first.  And then see if you can reason which ones it works for which ones it doesn't work for.  Okay.  Let's take a look more than most people are saying more than one of the above, which ones you guys think.  ANC  thanks for all real positive integers. Will Lyft let translate the sentence.  For all asking for all why?  If x is less than y then that means that there's a number in between X and Y. That's how I would kind of think about it and the real numbers have this property.  Frank even the real numbers in this closed interval have this property, right? If any of that have any pair of numbers where X is less than why do you always find a number in between?  How come the integers don't have this property?  Okay good so we can give like a very specific example, right?  If x is 2 and Y is 3 than 2 is less than 3 and there does not exist.  AZ  That's an integer such that.  2 is less than Z is less than 3.  because  there's nothing in there.  What about the power set?  Doesn't really make sense, right? You can't talk about one set being less than another set.  It's not the right type.  trick questions  Okay good.  Okay, let's get into some proof strategies. This is where the class kind of took a turn, huh?  Okay. So this is like we we we split up Spruce strategies into two different classes right is like this class of kind of standard proof strategies and then we did a whole thing on induction. Right? So I'll get to that later. So what kind of proof strategies do we have? We have direct proofs contrapositive contradiction. We want you to be able to kind of find the flaw in fallacious proofs-proofs proof by cases evaluate, which proof techniques is appropriate.  we could also have  Proof by example, right. I guess I should put that up there, too.  I guess that's sort of like direct proofs. Also, if it if you're trying to prove an existence statement, you can just come up with an example. If you're trying to prove a false statement. They have to do something a little bit more clever one way to do it is to do a contradiction proof because what you're essentially what you're doing is you're turning a Ferrell statement into an existence statement cuz your neck dating after all statements. Oh, that's  Kind of a way to to get around.  Okay, let's do a sample proof by contradiction.  There are infinitely many Primes.  So what would be the will be the negation of the statement? What where do we want to start our contradiction proof?  proof  by contradiction  assume that  Right, there are not infinitely primes or right or their finite amount of primes.  Okay, so that's where you start right that part didn't require any thought the next parts. That's where you kind of have to you know, figure out how to lead yourself to a contradiction. Okay. So if they're finally many primes one thing we could do is list them all out.  Sure, they're finally many primes. So.  List them out in terms.  Upsize right from from least to greatest who be like P1 P2 all the way up to Let's APK, right? There's K products. I mean if there's a finite amount there's some number of primes right and there's going to be a biggest Prime PK.  So PK is the biggest Prime.  Okay. Now I've seen this proof. It's kind of like a very classical proof. So I know where I'm going with it, and I know that that's not always the case when you're trying to do a proof so  I apologize for 4 that I'm not really showing you the struggle through it. But essentially what I'm going to try to do is construct some Prime bigger than pique. If I've done then I have proven this statement because I come up with a contradiction. The contradiction is that PK is the biggest Prime and also this other Prime I constructed is also the biggest Prime you can't have two biggest primes therefore. It's a contradiction.  Has anybody else seen this proof?  How do you construct a the bigger Prime?  What is it?  Okay, good. Consider consider.  Let's call it a big end is equal to P 1 x p 2 x p 3.  x p k + 1  now and  does not work none of these primes divide and evenly right cuz every time you divide and by any of these primes you get a remainder of 1 Okay, so  P1 does not divide N I guess it was just say it like all Primes.  P12 PK do not divide.  So if n doesn't have any Prime divisors that means and has to be prime itself, right?  Cuz if it has a composite divisor, then that means it divides the primes that make it up. Okay, so doesn't have any Prime divisors. This means that end.  Is also Prime.  And and is greater than PKA.  Which contradicts?  the fact  that PK is the biggest Prime.  Okay questions.  This is like this sorry.  It's so that you can show that every time you divide and buy any Prime you get a remainder of one. So that means that it will not divide any Prime.  Oh just PK plus one. Yeah, it's so there's no we don't know if PK Plus One will divide any other number with a vitamin of the other Primes.  We know for a fact that this number and will not divide any P1 through PK. It won't divide any of those numbers and therefore it won't divide any number at all except for itself.  Speaker cables into adding one makes it an even number because they are all times but you were on so that one automatic.  Yeah, but P1 is to  OIC  At PK Plus One will usually divided by 2.  Any other questions?  Good.  This is a this is a good proof kind of to look at because it's it's sort of weird, you know, the thing that we proved the thing. The thing that we proved was a contradiction didn't really have a lot to do with the you know, the initial sentence, right? So sometimes it's surprising the the thing that you have to contradict.  That's kind of a lesson I guess.  Okay next thing sex.  Okay, and we only have a few more minutes left. So let's just kind of go through what we should know about sex.  So we have all these names for sets right and z z plus. I want you guys to be all familiar with those. I guess we didn't talk so much about sea.  But sees the set of complex numbers.  You don't really have to know that up for this class. We're not going to ask you out on the on the exam. Okay, we talked about the empty set the set 0 1 * which is the set of all binary strings.  We want you to be familiar with the set notation. How do you build sets?  Parking lot intervals and that kind of thing crew properties of sets subsets power set intersection Union. And how did those relate to the binary? The skews me the Boolean logic operators. Remember that intersection has a lot to do with and Union has a lot to do with or subset has a lot to do with implied bias. Remember how we made those connections. Those are going to be really helpful when you have to do proofs about sex.  Cartesian products  Okay, so maybe this will be our last quicker question for today.  Four set assets power set is the set of all subsets of s which of the following is not true in general.  Okay good.  Okay.  I think we have a little bit of discussion to do I talk it over with for the next 2 or 3 minutes. Talk it over with your neighbor and see if you can come up with a consensus.  No.  Are all the power set?  We just had a kind of a problem with the font.  Yeah burger.  okay, we're still sort of our  I guess most people are saying.  None of the above.  Okay. So those of you who are saying none of the above you're saying that all of these things have to always be true, right?  Okay.  I'm going to have you guys take this one home as an exercise.  We'll start with that on Friday.  State is 12/5 right?  Yep. Thank you.  Did did unbelievable. Thank you.  3000 which one do you prefer?  Thank you.  It's amazing. What happened with lunch?  first one great discussion with the code "
