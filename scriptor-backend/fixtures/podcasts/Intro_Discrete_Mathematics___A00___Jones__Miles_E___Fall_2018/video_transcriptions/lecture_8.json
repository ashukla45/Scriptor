    "Full Transcript": "Good morning class.  Morning.  All right.  Let's get started.  So what are we doing today?  We're going to continue with this nested quantifiers trying to translate these things so he can get a good idea.  Talk about the truth values are nested quantifiers. What else then we're going to move into the sort of the next topic. It's basically just how to prove things. So we'll look today at  A few examples of some proof after that, okay.  so  Solutions posted on Piazza for the homework for the what was that homework to that you can turn in this weekend. There's a common issues post. So we try to kind of collect all the common mistakes that you guys have done post them on Piazza so you can look at them and see why they're a mistake and how to do it the correct way.  and  on grade scope there is a possibility that you'll get some comments on your work. Even if you got full credit just to kind of give you some tips here and there or if you do know if we have some suggestions on how we want to see your work presented.  look at all those things before you make a regrade request if it's still you, have a nice question about your  Great Bend pain, please. Let us know.  Okay, let's song. We've already done these these the nested quantifiers, but I wanted to revisit them again, so  Maybe did we do this one yet?  Okay, so this  predicate is X have sent a text to why? Okay. So how would you interpret this proposition?  Okay, so there's one person that sent a text to everybody in the class.  Frank so one person sent out a text to everybody.  There's this some accept that brawl why I sent a text to why can't you send a text to himself to write?  We said that was allowed.  Okay, how about this one?  For all X there exists a y such that Q of X Y.  Yeah, so this one is a little bit different right? This is saying that everybody has sent a text to somebody else or somebody, right?  Maybe two people sent the same text to somebody maybe some person just send a text to itself and so on right?  Okay.  everybody  sent  a text to at least  one person  Okay, so we switched around some stuff. Okay. Here's another one where we're actually switching around the for all X in the there exists Y and we're going to get something different. What's this one?  The other way because they're exist. Why that's the recipient.  So one person got a text from everybody in the class.  Was texted by everyone.  You have that one person and he's happy, right?  Cuz he's so popular.  He sent a text to himself to.  All right. How about this one?  Yeah, everybody is seat received a text from at least one person.  Okay, good any questions about these so far?  Everyone send a text to someone in some cases. It's the same right because someone is at least one person.  Okay, how about this one?  Everybody send a text to everybody else right or everybody?  all EX  and for all y x send a text to why so this is just like all possible pairs, right?  Chalk.  everybody  send a text.  to everybody  all possible pairs  Frank saw any questions about that one  part  let's think about what are the  what are the how do you we restrict The Domain in order to make this true or false? So in which domain is this statement true?  Maybe what we could do first is translated into English, right? So this would be for all.  X  I guess asking the domain.  Right, which is what we're going to kind of look at.  There is a y such that.  X is less than y queso.  What are you guys say?  Looks like most people are going with c.  positive real numbers  Okay, so does that make sense for every positive real numbers for every positive real number X I can find it a bigger positive real number.  Okay, so that's good. How about  this 101 all the real numbers in the closed interval 0 want does this work?  Okay good. So this statement is claiming that for all X in the domain. I can find a Wawa in the domain that's bigger than x but if I choose X to be one in this domain then there's no there's no other number in that domain. That's bigger than once if this one fails  Okay, how about the set of integers 1 2 3?  Write it so you can't pick 3.  If x is equal to 3 there's nothing in there that's bigger than three. How about negative integers?  Right, nothing bigger than -1.  prank  Okay, here's kind of a tricky one. What about all negative?  real numbers  Okay. Yeah, I could right because there actually is no upper bound.  Well, there is a profound but the upper bout the the least upper bound is not part of the set. So any number that you got you can always find a number that's bigger than that in that set because we're talking about the Continuum of all real numbers. If you like. You can just take whatever number is in is midway between your number X and zero and that will never will still be in the SEC.  Funny one. Okay any questions?  All right. How about this one?  In which domain is the statement not true.  queso  You can either just try to kind of negate it or maybe we can use like the de Morgan's law to simplify the negation and make it maybe a little bit more.  easy to to understand so if I negate this thing  Write this logically equivalent to what whenever the negation passes over a for all it turns it into a there exists and vice versa. So this becomes actually there exists X there exists why for all the and then you negate this statement?  Which is this not able to see?  And so there is a there is a x and there is a why so there's a pair X and Y.  Such that for all the Z in the in the set X X Y is not equal to Z.  Okay. So a lot of people are saying all negative numbers.  I know that negative integers. Let's kind of think about why okay, let's start with that one all negative integers. Okay. So if X and Y  Are negative integers?  Then XY is positive, right?  So XY is going to not equal any of the elements of that set any of the  Any negative integer is always going to be positive. So that's good.  How about all real numbers in the closed interval 0 1 the problem with this one? Is that whenever you multiply two numbers in the set, you will always get another number in that same set. That's kind of what the question is at is is getting at  How about all real numbers same thing? Right? If you ever multiply two real numbers you always get another real number everytime positive real numbers the same thing positive integers and stuff.  Okay any questions about this?  What should I say again?  What's -0?  Is what?  Is it a thing?  Noah for now is zero is just you.  I think about that though.  0 is not a negative number not even negative zero is is it or is it?  Okay, zero is not a negative number.  Okay, let's some let's do some some more exercises. I want you guys to  Write this in terms of quantifiers. Okay, ready go.  Okay, so you're going to have to just find what your predicate is.  Faye like P of X Y is equal to  Where is the statement that?  Exit positive or why is x times y or something like that?  Okay. So what what do I want my predicate to be P of x?  Is what the statement?  X is positive right now.  So what you guys did?  Okay, so then there's two ways to kind of go about this either we can state with the domain is and do it that way or we can kind of put the domain inside of the print into the proposition. So one way to say it, is that the domain  is  negative  real real numbers  and then you just say for all X.  Pete asking me for all access for all why  P of x * y  Any questions about that?  Yeah.  Maybe it would be better if I if I kind of called this a different thing.  Like this is like plz means that Z is positive rights. Just kind of like a  a variable in there  The X & Y both come from the domain, but that doesn't say anything about what their product is now the other way to write it.  Would be you say for all X for all Y and then you'd say something about the domain, right?  X is negative  and why is negative?  That's just saying that they are both negative numbers this implies P of x * y.  I saw you guys it's just it's just about your personal preference. Do you want to State the domain first and just say for everything in the domain or you can kind of specifically say what the domain is in the proposition.  X and Y are not equal to a real.  Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, so  Right, I'd say.  and  X is X and Y are real X is real.  And why is real?  Sorry about that to be to be most specific.  Yeah, I'm using the same predicate. Sorry. I should maybe go like this.  That your question.  yeah, and in most cases, I don't know if I want to make it like a blanket saying but  yeah, sometimes you only work with integers and sometimes you know, the predicate is only really make sense with integers. This one makes sense with real numbers and  I should I should be more careful. I think.  I think so. Yeah, I think so, but just maybe maybe ask for clarification if you run into it.  That's if you have a for all.  Remember we had like the for all and then there exists.  So if it's for all you do domain and pies the  Yeah, the predicate.  Let's do another one.  Hello, this one the difference between a real number and itself is zero.  Okay, and you can choose whether to Define your predicate itself or just right in what it is. So what do I mean by that?  You can just say something like domain.  is  all real numbers  Frank and then the statement would be for all X.  X minus X is zero.  Something like that, or you can Define the predicate to be like P of X is the statement X is zero or something like that. So  Just mainly how you want to it's your personal preference how you do that any questions about this one?  All right, last one. No.  How many do I have?  Here's another one a negative real number does not have a square root. That is a real number. So let's do  the domain here  Will be negative real numbers.  or no  cuz it kind of depends on what I want to do here.  I guess I want to have like two kind of domains, right?  I guess let's just say that the domain is all real numbers.  Okay, so then this just says that for all X.  Better negative, right?  and for all  why that's positive.  right  square root X is not equal to y.  that work  I know that's what that said if you have a square root.  No, I'm saying for all y+.  I'm restricting ex to be negative and why to be positive and I'm saying for every pair of negative number positive number the square root of a negative number is not equal to the positive number.  No, cuz I'm I'm restricting why to be positive here.  Stop music.  Not going to be a wife.  Oh, it's a real number. I see what you guys are saying.  So you just put it like this.  Like for all X less than zero square root access is not real.  Yeah.  Turn also works, right?  What so you don't want it? You don't want to set a predicate to be a mom like a mathematical operation. Like for example, if you say p of why is square root wire or something like that does not going to be good because you want your predicate to have a truth value and needs to be like a statement. So I need to be something like Scribble square root square root. Why is real or  Something that you can assign a truth value to because the value of that is going to be some number.  Okay good. So you can alternatively do domain is all negative numbers.  Reels right and then you just say for all X.  Sqrt X is not real.  That's probably the best huh?  Okay.  All right, last one for sure this time.  Every positive real number has exactly two square roots.  now it doesn't say what these where these two square roots can come from I'm assuming that it's like  You should really say exactly to.  real square roots  so  the domain  I'll say is real numbers.  Will have for all X.  greater than 0  right  Then what?  So there exists a y there exists a z such that.  Oh.  Because we said exactly two.  access akashic records  and yeah, you can do it that way to it has been the proposition is that X has exactly two square root, but let's see if we can figure it out with with these with these things Okay, so  so we're saying that for all X greater than 0 there's a y and there's a z  such that okay, and then we need another one for all w.  But you also need to say that y&z are the only ones right?  Okay, so  for all  okay for all X greater than 0 there is a y and there is a z  such that for all.  W not equal to Y and W not equal to Z.  If I can stay for all W just do that. Look at here we go square root X.  No.  This one's getting complicated.  Let's just do every positive real number has two real square roots. How about that?  Hi.  And then we just say square root X or no, let's say it like this y squared is equal to x and z squared is equal to X.  And why is it? All right and Y is not equal to Z.  right  Okay, that's good. Alright do the  original statement  as an exercise  okay, so let's move on with the with the logical equivalence of the  Nested quantifiers. Okay stop.  Is it true that for every meaning of the predicate and every domain of discourse not there? Is there exists X for all y p of x y and for all X there exists why not pfx why it's always has the same truth value.  It's always the case.  Bob you guys think about that. All right, let's go into the proof. So here's like a funny comic or what I think is funny. So one of the people says just for the sake of argument, let's say that and he says wait for the sake of what argument. Okay, cool. That's totally a good reason to say something that's wrong. I have arguments. He's just trolling the other person the whole time. So I think it's kind of funny. Anyhow, so arguments are going to be kind of the framework that we build proofs on. Okay. So we're going to say that an argument is valid if every step of the way is logically is a logical step. Let's say that  And a valid argument also will at the very end.  Establish the truth of a statement. Okay. So so valid it just means that the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the premises and the preceding statement. So I have to be valid throughout the whole thing. Okay, and argument is just a sequence of statements ending with a conclusion.  Okay, so when we build these proofs there's certain things that we just kind of assumed to be true. And these type of things are axioms statements that you assume are true. And a lot of the times you'll see that axioms are these kind of universal statements that everybody agrees upon to be true and you can use them to kind of filled your proof. So if anybody has taken any kind of euclidean geometry class, you'll see that a lot of the theorems are built on these axioms very simple things, but nobody has proven them. So the axioms in euclidean Geometry are  Two lines cross in in one point, right? The intersection of two lines is one point, right? Another one is that if you connect two points you get a line, right? It's really hard to prove these things. They're just kind of statement that we all agree upon.  Okay. So the once you get the axioms and the assumptions, you build your rules of inference and your your argument and you end up at a conclusion. Once you've done that what you've done is you have constructed a proof and the original statement is a theorem.  so  mathematicians like to have all these fancy words for theorems. They're all basically the same thing. So theorem proposition fact result Lemma. Corollary. They're all the same. It's just a statement that has been proven by somebody.  all this means  statement  that has been proven.  Okay. So what rules of inference are allowed what makes a an argument valid what makes a step-by-step process each step valid.  Okay.  So I know which propositions are substituted in the conclusion is true if all premises are true.  okay, so there's a bunch of fancy names that you may run into modus ponens modus tollens and these are  these are used a lot maybe in the book in the text or a maybe in like a  logic class or philosophy class when you're trying to build arguments in this class. We're not really going to learn these words were just going to kind of learn how to use them.  But I will say something about these first two.  So the first one modus ponens is basically direct proof and you don't have to worry about the fancy name. Just remember how to do a direct proof.  Okay, so I direct proof is good when you're trying to prove an implication. So we want to prove if P then Q we want to prove P implies Q. Okay. So here's how you do you assume p is true. Then you use your rules of inference this in this and that and hopefully you end up and conclude that Q is true.  So there's another way to do this is called modus tollens, but I like to use proof by contrapositive better because it actually tells you what you're doing is you can change p.m. Pais que to not Q implies not-p.  Frank so I'm still trying to prove the same statement, but I'm doing it in a different way. So I'm proving if not you then not P. How do you do that? Well, you assume.  not qu  right..... Conclude  not too and since those fence every implication is  logically equivalent to its contrapositive this proof will prove the original statement.  conservative news that  okay, so let's dive into an example.  I have these two statements and squared + 1 is greater than equal to 2 and 1 and is a negative integer and square + 1 is greater than or equal to 2 + 1 N is a positive integer. What can you say about truth values of these statements?  just by your  Intuition or your your previous education of arithmetic  What are we saying?  Anybody have any comments?  Kind of have like a competing viewpoints hear that either both are true or one is true into his false.  First one as men get bigger to the end of smaller to blood side of crows.  that Brewery.  Play to the negative 1 come back when I get to work. Okay, right, so  So one is true, right?  And this is actually the one that we're going to prove. We're also going to prove to to be false. Why is to fall?  Okay good. So that's kind of like a good sort of.  way of  convincing yourself that it's false, right? Maybe you see it. You're like, oh, yeah. Oh that faster than quadratic. So it's got to be full. But what if I really actually wanted a a concrete reason.  Beyonce and her value where that's a win. Ruth if you put like a chief in his wife were there for you get 25 on the left hand side then 32 in the right hand side and see if there's an audience doesn't.  Okay good so you can this is false and you can prove it with a counterexample, right?  Okay. So remember that these you these Universal conditionals can be translated to this kind of statement where we say for all and if n is negative then the statement is true write so  We're going to use that implication as our structure for the proof for the direct proof. Okay, so if I have something like this.  To prove this statement is false. I need to find.  a counterexample  to prove that the statement is true. Then you have to do a direct proof and this is like something in the domain.  Imply some predicate right?  And there is a general form that mathematicians most always follow and it goes like this you select some general element of the domain.  And to do that usually say usually say something like this let X be in the domain.  I can say that and then you use these logical statements on acts as if it were any number and try to get to the conclusion.  Okay, and that will that will show that it's true for all elements of the domain because it didn't matter which exit you chose to begin with.  Okay, how do we prove that this is false while we already kind of did right since this is a universal conditional statement to prove that is false. It's enough to find one counterexample, and we considered and is equal to 5.  And we get that V squared + 1 is 26 to the 5th is 32 and the left hand side is less than the right hand side and that contradicts the statement. And so the answer is false. And so this is a proof that it's false.  In one way to kind of think about why we only need a counterexample.  Is because the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement by one of the gate for all I just have to show that there exists something that doesn't work.  Okay good.  alright, so  I've never want to prove that. This is true. We probably won't get through the whole proof. But let's just kind of get it started and this is what I want to show. Remember you safe for all and then you talk about the domain.  And then you say something right? This is kind of the statement or the predicate that you want to show.  Okay, so I say let N be an integer a general element of the domain for a direct proof. What do I assume?  White this is of anime.  peso  we assume.  Okay, so  Are we jumping on the bandwagon here? Okay, so this is good because I'm so be. Okay. So she is the right answer. I want to assume.  Be hypothesis, which is that and is negative. This is what I want to assume member be is what you want to prove so you don't want to assume that in the beginning you want to kind of logically get there.  From the Assumption. Okay, so I assume an is less than 0 and see how you can get to the end.  All right.  I only have one more minute left.  so  let's just kind of go one step further.  Maybe I can ask you guys to think about how to do this as an exercise.  think about  how  to finish this proof  as an exercise  Okay, how do you use the hypothesis? What's important about envying less than zero that makes this true, right and we know that that's important because we already showed that if n is greater than zero. It's not true. So there has to be something about him being less than zero to help you prove it right you need to use that information somehow. Okay, Wednesday. "
