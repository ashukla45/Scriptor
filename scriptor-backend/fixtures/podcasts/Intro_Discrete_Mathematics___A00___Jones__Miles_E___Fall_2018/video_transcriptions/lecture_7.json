So there's this thing where if you want it, there's like this digital copy of the textbook. There's like all this stuff that goes along with it. It's not required. If you if you bought the textbook the hard copy or have a digital copy yourself. That's perfectly fine.  If you want to opt out there is a there is a set of instructions that I posted on Piazza.

That's the Piazza post.  I think  let's take a look.  Piazza  dot-com  Okay, great. I don't have internet in here.  What is going on?  Is internet working for you guys.  Is terrible in here, right?  All right. So, what is my type in 80 know I'm typing at 80, right?  yeah at at  okay at at so the at A T post.  on Piazza  Okay, so there's a set of instructions there. I linked to it's like this little PDF tells you how to do it. So I think today is the last day or tomorrow is the last day or something to opt-out is tomorrow. Okay, so  It's a it's a post at 80 so search at 80 and then you can find the post and in that post. There's a there's a detail PDF, but I hope I'm hoping that you guys got to email.  And then what I mean react to set instructions for everybody instructions.  Stay right there sediment everybody instructions to do it via Triton Ed, but but we're not doing that in this class.  So you have to do it this way.  Okay.  You don't got anything.  Yes.  Funny, but it was a thing for you.  You still don't know. Yeah, you should have.  You might have like you. Yeah, you might have fallen under the radar.  Okay.  So yeah, take a look.  If you want this or you don't want this.  Okay, let's get started.  So what we're going to do today is just kind of talk more about this predicate logic the universal quantifier the existential quantifier all this stuff in more detail. So what are you guys say?  over the frequency here is a b  Okay, consider the statement every page in this book starts with a vowel.  What is the  negation of the statement  Okay, good more than one of the above which one which one's is it?  Bee and Andy, okay.  Any questions or comments?  Okay.  Bet that's a good point.  So in your biography the first page is just one picture of you.  And there's no words.  Okay.  So if this comes down to the the domain right, I guess I sort of assumed that I'm talking about a book where every page has at least one letter on it, right?  But if that's not the case if we're looking at the domain of all books and some of the books don't even have any any words on them. Then I would say be so busy is like the negation of the sentence, right?  It's not the case that every page in the book starts with a vowel now D. This is the negation right if  all pages  start  with  a letter  should I even say like a English letter or alphabet?  Isaiah English letter  Okay, that's very good. I didn't even think about that. So but it turns it into like a good learning point, right? We need to make sure that everybody's on the same page and we talked about domain.  Okay, good any other comments?  I'm bored. And there's at least one page in the book because I thought that it would be just like one case where there is a one-page.  It still would be.  See there is a page or there is at least one page. Those are equivalent statements.  That's different. And that's not that's not the negation, right?  We have a questions or comments.  Okay.  Why cannot see see is all pages in the book. Do not start with a vowel.  That means saw.  Imagine I have a book, right?  And all the pages start with a vowel.  Then that would mean the the original statement, right?  So the negation of the statement is any book?  That doesn't mean that first statement right until a book that has a consonant at the start of each page that will that will be fall?  I guess I'm not saying it well.  We say it like this.  But it's not to be true. You only need one page to not have a vowel.  That makes sense.  So maybe maybe start let's start with B.  Let's start with this.  because this is just kind of like  Directly negating it, right this is certainly the negation of the original statement, right? It is not the case that every page in the book starts with a vowel. That means that at least one of the pages does not start with a vowel or at least one page start with with a consonant.  right  Okay, so we want something that's always true whenever this thing is false.  Yeah.  So if a book has at least one consonant than that makes the original statement false.  But it would also makes a false right we want something that's like exact.  Okay, so we kind of talked about this before and this is sort of the nature of what we had in the previous slide we can think about.  spfx  does p of X being  book  Anna page sorry page X starts  with  vowel  If that's the case, then the statement that I the original statement I had before was for all x p of X that means for all pages in my book The Page starts with a bow. Okay, good now when I want to negate it.  And we kind of talked about this before it's like negating a bunch of ants because really what I'm saying is the first page starts with a vowel and the second pay starts with a vowel and the third pay start for the valley and so on right so just like in demorgan's law when you negate a bunch of Anne's you have a bunch of whores of their negations.  And remember that there exists is the oars.  So how do you translate that will the easy way to do it is to say there exists some acts. So there's this some paid but that that page does not start with a vowel for such that that page starts with a consonant if we're looking at a set of books that are the domain is like novels ranked.  Okay, so  Another way to say that is the first page does not start with a vowel or the second page does not start with a vowel or the third patient. So that's another way to say it.  Okay, and it works the opposite direction?  Okay, so we can use these then we're going to see these again.  So this one would be is not the case. So that's not for all x p of x.  And there exists so there exists.  An X such that not pee effects.  Frank speaker starts with a consonant is the negation of starts with a vowel in our world that were  All right good.  So let's talk more about the domain and Kate restricting the domain so every real number greater than one makes x squared greater than x  is this true?  What is statement what is the proposition right because it has a truth value. It's either true or false.  Now if I said any app for any x x squared is greater than x you sort of implied that I'm talking about the real number. So here I'm actually making a restricted domain right I'm saying if x is in this set of numbers greater than 1 then x squared greater than x should be true.  One way to write that would be for all X greater than one like this.  x squared is greater than x  And really what we're saying is for all X. The following statement is true.  X is greater than 1  implies that x squared is greater than x  okay, and this for all Acts?  right  this for all X is if it there's nothing there you can just think of it as the set of real numbers, okay.  And so it's saying that if the number is greater than 1 then I can I can apply this second disc consequent. Right but it's the number is not greater than 1 then the statement. If it's just true vacuously. It's it's like it doesn't really have a meaning really, but we just call it true.  So this is kind of the translation of that sentence, okay.  I'm so that's kind of the way to say.  queso for all X for all real numbers x if x is greater than 1 then x squared is greater than x  okay.  Let's do another.  exercise  if I wanted to say there is a real number greater than 1 that makes p of X true.  How would you translate that?  I got P of exes.  is the statement x squared is greater than x  okay.  so  anybody have any comments?  It's worth saying there exists an X. Such that X is greater than one implies x squared is greater than x  Don't think that's quite what we want.  The Great Migration  and why it why not? Why why is that not one? Not really what we want.  so  So what does the saying is assuming? So there is an X such that assuming it's one x squared is greater than x right, but what if that is not greater than 1  It's still true write the statement would still be true because of that because they're kind of the nature of that imply. So really what we want is something a little bit stronger than implies. We want and write because we want to stay there is an ex and I know two things about this at this x first of all, it's greater than one and second of all x squared is greater than x gay. So we really want and here because we don't want to fall into the the case where a hypothesis is false and that just makes the whole implication false. We really want it to be this way.  Okay any questions?  Okay, good question. So how come this one is implication and the other one is and  so  so this needs to be true.  For all X rank in cell if my ex is the domain of real numbers, right? Then I want this to be true for all X in that domain. I want a big to be what the statement to be true for all real numbers even negative real numbers. Right? And this one will be true for negative real numbers because it will say if x is greater than 1 quarts not greater than one. So it's this statement is still true because it didn't follow the hypothesis.  How can I make sense?  Whereas the existence proof is we really need a zero in on one thing and show that everything have all the statements are true.  Kind of a different different thing.  Okay, so  so I think about when we are restricting the domain you have the big yellow circle, which will be like the set of all.  Let's see.  Pfx is this?  Ice cube of X. Okay.  So let's just say it this way. I think I changed what P of X was? Okay. Let's change it back. Okay, we're going to stay here is better than one. Okay and Q of X is x squared is greater than x k so restricting the domain is actually a predicate. So this is going to be the set of all numbers that are greater than 1 and this will be the rest of the real numbers. Let's say or whatever kind of domain you're talking about.  so when we talkin about for all x p of X in 5 q of x  just like what I was saying before for everything in here Q of X is true, right?  For everything out here is just vacuously true.  Okay, and so for that now we know it's true for all X.  because of the implication  Now if we want to talk about there exists, well, I really wanted I really want a pinpoint INXS in my domain that I talked that I'm talking about. So if there exists a text that's in. Axe, okay?  And I has the desired property.  Give thanks and collect. So maybe that's another way you can kind of think about it.  Okay.  Let's talk about the empty domain now.  When we start talking about set theory will start talking about the empty set.  And it will be kind of a confusing thing for some of you it's still kind of confusing for me when I encounter it, so, don't be don't feel bad.  So what if my question is? What is the domain of discourse is empty. So what I'm trying to say is when I say for all X Y SE for all X in the empty set is true.  Or there exists an X in the empty set such that P of X is true.  And the empty set has the type of properties where it doesn't really matter. What. Axe is whatever you say it is these statements will always either be true or false. So which one are they? Are they always both true and that was both true or false is one of them always true one of them always falls and I'll try to kind of  work it out in your mind.  Talk it over with your neighbor if you like.  And if it makes it even a little bit better, we can write it in terms of the four we had before.  Is it going to translate to?  for all X  x in the empty set implies  Fridays are kind of the translations we had when we were restricting a domain.  Hey, does this kind of help out a little bit?  Okay good. So, let's look at it. Let's look at be  All right.  All right B says for all x p of X always evaluates to True. Why is that?  And if you can't find a single thing.  Write this couldn't one. That's one good way to kind of think about it. Right? It's that there's nothing there to make it fall. So it's got to be true. Another way to say it is look at look at what we how we translated it.  Where's my pen?  I'll get it to work in a minute translated. It is an empty implies P of X is true, but they're painting the element so there's no element that's in it. So that means the hypothesis will always be false and if the hypothesis is false for a implications in the whole thing is true.  So that first pro XP of X will always be true if the if you have the empty domain, what about the second one?  Right, so there never will be an element in the empty set. So did this and statement the first part of the ants table will always be false which will make the whole thing. C is the right answer here. I'm not sorry.  B is the right answer here. All right, let me try to fix this pain here.  I think I know how to do this. Okay?  See if that worked.  Okay, it worked great. We're back in business.  All right.  now  let's get into translations. We're going to translate these English sentences into okay. I want you guys to work on these.  So what kind of things should I tell you?  first of all  Let's give some names to some things. Okay. So let's say the universal domain.  is  my garage  and let's say that.  T-Rex  Is equal to X is in the correct place?  Let's say that.  Sea of X is X is in excellent condition.  And what's 80 of X is X is a tool.  Okay, so take a few minutes and see if you can kind of translate these into a predicate.  Explorer 3.5  No, that's that's fine. Because  it doesn't fall into the domain. I never said anything about exes that are less than one right. I'm only trying to make this claim for X's that are greater than one.  What was that?  Is everybody okay?  You're good.  Oh, it's not so bad.  Okay, good. Alright, you can somebody help me with number one.  there exists  there exists X such that not P of x  That's good question.  Okay. How about the next one? Number two?  for all x p of x  and sea of x  Okay, good any questions about that?  Okay, how about the third one?  pivx and Selix  Okay good.  Okay, let's just let's stop there for just a second.  What happened to that guy? So oh I have C instead of d.  Sorry about that. Let's think about this one just for a second. I'm going to give you some options.  This is for this one here. Which one is true?  Can we have some sort of differing viewpoints here?  Are you ready? Just going to jump on the bandwagon?  I talked it over with your neighbor for a minute see if we can come to a consensus.  Barbie is holding out.  Yeah. Alright, let's talk about B.  The translation of bee is it is not the case that for all Xbox and DMX right is not the case for that for all things that thing is in the right place and in the end has the excellent condition.  so  anybody have any comments?  Not in the correct either not in the correct place or not.  But what statements are saying is that you are nothing if it is.  Okay, good. Yeah. So the problem about be is that it's saying that it's not the case that they all do something and if you remember our demorgan's law that turns out to be that there exists something that it's not the case for right so it kind of turns out that nothing this this word sort of translates to it is not the case that there exists something.  Look, kind of make sense. Nothing means or nothing.  Nothing has this desire property. It means that it is not the case that there exists something that has a desire property.  Like if I said none of them?  Yeah, that's like the most demorgan's law. Yeah, this is the this is saying nothing is both in the correct place.  And excellent condition I guess I'm just using D now. Sorry. Okay, so if I wanted to simplify this or I guess like translated into a different form using demorgan's law the way to do it.  Okay good. So basically this not symbol.  As you kind of crossover the the quantifier it changes it, right. So it's going to change it from a there exists to a for all so for all Acts.  It's not the case that P of x.  and D of x  Frank and then you can now you can use the regular demorgan's law to put it in there and you can get something that is for all X not P of X or not DMX.  And I don't know if that answers your question kind of saying now for all the things.  Something that's true for all the things is that they're not in the right place and they're not in excellent condition.  Any other questions about that one?  All right.  Stop, that's these laws again now.  Right. So we have these two equivalent statements. Now, what about the last one?  One of the tools is not in the correct place, but it is in excellent condition. So one of the tools makes me think of what  there exists right there exists a thing such that this thing is what this thing is. Definitely a tool, right?  What else?  And it's not in the correct place.  What else?  And it's not an excellent condition or is an excellent condition. Thank you.  like this  So it's not a sorry.  I bet yeah, that's fine. It's  yeah, that's fine, too.  It's kind of like not a direct translation, but it's logically equivalent. So it's fine.  I didn't know that which one when you use the word tools.  Exactly. It's because we're restricting the domain and remember when we were strict a domain with for all it's like the domain implies something and then when it's for exists, it's the domain and something.  Is another question around here?  I come from restricting the domain down to just the tools in my garage.  All right good.  All right, let's some start talking about nested quantifiers. So this is where we're going to have more than one quantifier. Okay, so I'm going to say this statement this predicate now this predicate has two variable X and Y. So kieu of X and Y is the statement X has sent a text to why OK the domain is going to be everybody in the class.  this thing this song  Proposition I guess is red there.  exists  a student  X  and there exists  a student y  such that.  Ex sent a text to why the old way of translating it formal way of saying this.  Be somebody.  Yeah, or like somebody send a text to somebody else.  That's all that's all. I'm really saying right because it could be that other people are sending texts to but I'm just saying that at least one person send a text to at least some other person. So this is the kind of picture you're thinking about and the rest of the class. You don't really know what's going on.  Okay, how about this one?  I can cut somebody.  Maybe by accident  Casey had like this one student here and you send a text to every other student in the class, right?  Kind of like how I think about it questions about that.  Does the order matter?  What if I did it this way?  Okay, good everybody.  Send a text.  2  one particular person  I guess I guess I could just say one person right because it could be the case that there were two people that got all of the texts right but I'm saying is that there exists there's that one person that existed that received all the texts.  Actually, this is not the case.  This is not true. This is not correct. Sorry about that. We have to be very careful here.  Well, I guess okay. Here's where this kind of stuff gets a little ambiguous. Am I saying that there was like one person that got a text from everybody in the class or am I saying that every person sent a text to somebody else?  And not necessarily the same person.  No, but I'm saying that it's not necessarily just one person that receives all the text. Is that everybody send send a text to somebody?  Now that's a better way of saying it I think.  everybody  Send a text.  2  some somebody  in the class  That's still a little ambiguous, right?  But it doesn't necessarily have to be somebody else, but maybe we can stay.  Each person sent a text to another person. Maybe that's better.  Okay, so it's kind of like here's if this is the whole class here right? Then maybe he's sent to that guy. Maybe that guy sent over here. Maybe this one send a text and maybe these three sent those ones and then maybe something like that and this guy send a text over there.  They really live here, but it doesn't necessarily imply that someone didn't send a text to install.  To another person. I'll just say to a person that's very good. Thank you.  kind of schedule  they could have can you send a text to yourself?  That's a good way to remind yourself of stuff, right?  Okay, so sew along the lines of does the order matter so I can have one more minute. So I changed the A and the and the the for all Exist by change those whole things around.  There exists a y such that all x q of X Y.  No, this is the one where there's that unlucky person that received all the texts.  He even he even text himself Denis.  Unlucky person or maybe lucky if he wants to be very popular and all the students all texted him.  you text Michelle to  okay. Alright song. "
