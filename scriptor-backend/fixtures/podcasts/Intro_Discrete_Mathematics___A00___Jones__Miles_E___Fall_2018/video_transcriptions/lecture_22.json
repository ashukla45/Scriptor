So it's kind of like what we what I set out to do last time. We're going to get a little bit farther.  Just to remind you.  We talked about last time we talked about.  finite sets and countable sets  Okay finite sets are just sets with a finite number of values. Does anybody remember the definition of countable sets?  So let's say it like this.  s is countable  countably infinite. Let's say that one.  If and only if what does anybody remember?  Okay, good. So  one way to say it is that  the cardinality is the same as the the cardinality of the set of positive integers. And what is the definition of two cardinalities be equal?  Okay, good. If and only if  there is a bijection.  app that takes a to z  Okay.  Okay, so  Any set is infinite. What does it mean to be infinite?  s is infinite  If and only if the cardinality of s is greater than or equal to the cardinality of the place, so I could be countably infinite or even a bigger infinite which is what we're going to be calling uncountable Okay, so uncountable.  Is the last thing we have s is uncountable.  If and only if s is strictly bigger than the cardinality of Z class and we're going to we're going to see an example of that today.  Case that's where that's where we're headed towards.  Okay, a few Logistics. The homework is due tomorrow instead of 2 days ago if you haven't gotten the message already.  There's no class on Friday. If you haven't already figured that out to Thanksgiving all this kind of stuff. There will be class on Wednesday.  Okay, so  I wanted to go back to this clicker question. See if you guys remember the  the answer here  Which of the following is not true?  Okay, good. Let's see here.  Cuz you're saying none of the above.  well  guess that's okay because we still haven't proved that.  This is false.  We're going to see that the power set of a set always has a strictly bigger cardinality than the set itself. We're going to prove that for every single and so is that that also follows for infinite sets to  Okay, but how about these ones you guys remember how we did the the union how we prove this? Is anybody remember what was kind of like the general strategy that we did?  Okay, proving a bijection function or make a list or what was it zipper you zip them up?  This one's actually pretty straightforward because a intersect B is always a subset of a and we proved yesterday that if a if you have a subset of another set the cardinality has to be less than or equal to the cardinality of the others. So that one's easy. Is anybody remember how we did this one?  And you kind of Zig Zag?  any questions  Okay, let's look at this one again.  So A and B are both countable. So aa1888 can be written in a list A1 A2 A3 and so on B can be written in a list B1 B2 B3. So on so then A cross B can be written in a list in the way that we do it is we make a matrix A-1 B-1  A2 B1  A2 B2  A 1 b 2 and so on.  Something like that, and we said let's just zig zag like that.  We're not going to miss any of the things and they're all in there. It's a list, any questions about that.  Okay, so a cross be right is all of the ordered pairs of A and B, right? So let's think about what is z + cross Z. + it's all the ordered pairs of positive integers, right?  What else kind of looks like a ordered pair?  Is a fraction fraction is just a pair of integers. They have to follow some certain rules, right you can never have zero in the denominator, but we're just talking about positive integers anyway, so this is how we prove that the set of all fractions is also countably infinite.  okay, I just plug in my computer and so we can do this same idea where we make a matrix and you basically put  the  the fraction I / J.  is found  in entry  IJ  You just put it in there now. We've listed them all out.  Now remember why listing them out is a valid way of proving something is countably infinite right? Because whenever you list something out, let's say you listed as a one-v-one. What am I doing may 18283 and so on if you have a any sequence, that's that's already kind of in the form of a bijection to the positive integers because we just say that F of one goes to A-1 at 4 to go to a 2 after 3 goes to a 3 and someone  Okay. So this this is zig. Zag is actually a function.  Okay, let me just write down a first the this is actually a function f that map's Z + 2.  Q Plus  weird Q  rank  and let me just write out a few of the function values.  What is a half of 1?  1-ranked  what about half of 2?  2  what about after 3?  1/2  half of 4  1/3  and so on right?  questions about that  One more kind of thought about about this being accountable is that we could map or function that brings Z + 2z + Crosby. + and is he put Frosty + Goetz map to this one? Just buy the same entry of the Matrix kind of what we're going to think about here.  is a different function where were mapping Q + 2z + Crosby + the  the positive rational numbers to Z + Crosby + where we map p over Q gets map to the entropy, Okay. So which one of these statements is true?  Okay. Well, we should have a little bit of discussion here. Okay?  Let me ask you a question in this function. What is f of 1/2 equal to?  One, two. Okay good.  So then what is a 5 of 2/4 equal to?  2, 4  you see a problem here.  The same input map to two different outputs.  So this function is not well defined.  Any questions about that?  Okay, good night to self.  Let some let's move on.  The next thing we're going to do is we're going to prove that there is an uncountable set. And the way that we're going to do that is prove this theorem that says for every set a the cardinality of a is not equal to the power set the cardinality of the power set of a now if a is finite set we can kind of we can kind of convince ourselves of this right. It's pretty pretty easy to convince ourselves, right? So let's let's try to think about this first  if a is finite  with  a equal to Anne Frank, then the power set of a  is equal to what does anybody remember?  2 to the n  Okay. So if any is fine, I always really have to do is show that and is not equal to choose again, which is true for any finite number. So really the the weight of this theorem is is most importantly  Used to show that for an infinite set a the power set of a has a different cardinality.  Okay, so what to do this proof? Let's do a little bit of warm up here. Okay.  I'm going to define a function from  the set 1/2 to the set Power set of 1/2. Okay, and there's nothing really special about this function. It's kind of arbitrary. Okay, so don't think that there's like a really nice well rule for it. It's just that I Define dysfunction. It's well-defined. It's fine. It turns out that it's not on to right.  Which is fine, okay.  So now let's define this other set the set D. It's the set of all elements.  a such that a is not in a half of a  what is the here?  First of all think about what is DD is a set of elements D is going to be a subset of 1 2 no matter what no matter what function I put up there Dee will always be a part of the power set. So  What is D in this particular function example?  Okay, good. We have a little bit of uncertainty here. Why don't we discuss it together? Okay. Wanted to talk to your neighbor see if you can convince them of what you think and see if we can come to a consensus ready go.  Was Tiffany born?  Chase  let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Are you guys changing your your answers?  We're still mainly sang the empty set but I just one has gotten a little bit more love here. Okay, let's go through it. Okay. Now this is set builder notation right was just basically means it's the set of all elements of 1 to such that right a is not equal is not in. So all we really have to do is test it out on all the elements of 1/2 Let's test it out. Okay, so  If a is equal to 1 then what?  is one inside half of 1  know why not because apple one is equal to the set to  one is not in half of one which is equal to the second inning to write.  Okay, how about 2?  If so, this is know if a is equal to 2 then we have is two in a half of 2.  Yes, right because F of 2 is II training 1 and 2.  2 is in 1/2 of 2 which is equal to one, two.  Got any questions about that?  So it's like and this is going to we're going to generalize this.  This concept so just think about it. It's go through every single element and check to see if it's in the set that you mapped it to.  question  Well, there could be a function where it would be the empty set.  for example  What if your function was instead it was a 5-1 is equal to one lockology write G of 1 is equal to 1 + 2 is equal to 2 write a function that D function will be equal to the empty set because every every element appears in their image.  Thanks. So if this were the case D is equal to the empty set.  Okay.  So what I want you to notice here is that  this guy here  the set containing one which is which is in the power set of 1/2 is not map to  Okay, it's left out of the function image, right?  And this is going to be the concept that we're going to use.  Dysfunction D or the excuse me this set the no matter what the function is will never be in the range of the function.  I mean you could even look at this one here.  Dysfunction the only sets that you map to our II anyone in the second inning to D, which is the empty set is not map to this is going to be the the concept that we're going to use.  Okay, so this is called cantor's diagonalization argument.  Hey, and this is some.  the best way to show that these two sets are not  Okay, so there's that here's a damper. I reset the cardinality of the set a is not equal to the power set the Carnelian power set proof by contradiction. Let's suppose that they were equal right but supposed that  The cardinale's were evil. So by definition of how you compare cardinalities. That means that there exists some bijection from a to the power set of a  Okay, let's call that bijection app. Okay.  there's some bijection app and it Maps one element from a to one element from the power set of a and it's a bijection which means it's one to one and it's on to  We're going to show that is it is impossible to make an onto function?  Which will break our contradiction right? So that's that's our goal. How do we show something is not on to you find something in the codomain that can't get map to  wideye potion  So, how are we going to do that? We consider this Saturday. It's the same kind of thing that we did before D is defined to be the set of all.  Let's say it again like we did before I like that way the set of all aana such that.  a is not an F of a  There's no way that this function will mapanything to this set and let's see why.  so  any questions so far?  I do want to also note that D is in the codomain, right because it's a it's a subset of.  Set of elements of a subset of a okay. So let's suppose by contradiction that this function is onto which means that for every set an account in the codomain. There is an element in the domain that maps to it. So for exempt for specifically let's talk about this set. D right since the function is onto there is some element that maps to it. Let's call that element Little D. Okay. So Define Little D to be the pre image of DNA under app so ft is equal to D and we can we can find such an element because we're assuming that the set it on 2.  f is  want to  okay now.  We're going to ask a very specific question here.  is d  in D  This is like a yes or no question, right? And so it can only be one of two things.  So let's consider both of those as cases first. Let's let's suppose that D is actually in D. Okay.  So is D&D. Well if it is.  Goodbye, the definition of d e is not in jeopardy, which is equal to D.  Okay. If we assume that D is in fact in F of D, then we show that it actually can't be in. So this is where we get our contradiction.  Okay case to if we assume that D is not in F of the band by the definition of d Big D. It's the case that D must also be empty if it's not in deed and it is indeed, but if it isn't even it's not in D.  I'll just give you guys just a minute maybe to let that sink in any questions.  Preimage preimage is the the element in the domain the element in the domain. So preimage just means that F of G is equal to T. That's what it is.  This is pretty heavy stuff, huh?  What some?  Let's just kind of go through one of the cases together. Just so that you see where this thing came. I don't know if just talking about it. It's good enough. Okay, so suppose.  This case one.  suppose the is in  f  Update that means since since I fell asleep with the big D. Now. I now I realize that using the same letter is very confusing.  Okay, so let's write it out. Okay. So this means that D is in Big D Wright because of this definition.  Now remember, what is the property of Big D?  If something is in Big D, that means it's not in its own image. I'm so this implies that D is not in jeopardy.  That's it.  any questions  maybe try to  Two Step through case 2 as an exercise Okay, so  k-stew  suppose  D is not in a 50  exercising  Okay, so let's move on from here.  This is what we've have we have proved.  Here, let me write it out. We have proved we have proved that the cardinality of a is not equal to the cardinality of the power set of a  for all sets a  Okay, so it's specifically this is what I want to look at the power set of the of Z plus we know that z+ is infinite and it's countable.  To the power set of Z Plus has to be uncountable. It's not countable kinds of Power set of z+ is strictly greater.  cardinality then  What else is uncountable the set of all real numbers is uncountable the set of all even just the bounded interval from 0 to 1 is uncountable.  Even the weather or not you include the endpoints.  So we're going to look into these is going to be our next. Thank you.  Okay, so I'm going to show that the set of real numbers.  Is uncountable.  Okay, the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to just focus on this subset.  From zero to one. Okay. So if I can show that the interval from 0 to 1 is uncountable that will show me that the whole all the real numbers is also accountable because it's a subset.  Okay. So one way to describe real numbers is by an infinite decimal expansion.  So think about this infinite decimal expansion B1 B2 B3 B4 as just as expense its its expansion and it's always infinite. We're going to say that if it's if it terminates then it's just followed by a bunch of zeros. So for example, right 1/3 is going to be a course 0.33333.  1/10 is equal to 0.1 0 0 0 0 sequence of digits.  So what I'm going to attempt to do is  Define dysfunction from P of Z Plus.  into the  interval 01  if I can show that this is a certain type of function, then we'll have our conclusion that the set of all real numbers is uncountable.  So this is how I'm going to Define my function.  So here's the function app.  And remember what your domain and your codomain are your domain is sets your codomain are real numbers. I'm going to map set to a real number. How am I going to do that? Ok, very simple procedure.  Okay, so I take my sat on this should have been a small fire. I take my set.  And I make each one of these digits equal to one if its subscript is in the set and equal to zero if it's subscript is not in the SEC. So for example  F love  the set containing  134  what is this map to?  0.1 0 1 1 0 0  So you put ones wherever the elements of the set are and put zeros everywhere else.  Any questions about that?  Now answer my question here. What's true about at F is onto f is one-to-one or F is one to one and onto  Let's see here.  Okay, little bit of uncertainty here.  Alright, let's discuss.  Might take some time to kind of wrap your head around. What is it? We're doing I want you to whatever whatever choice you picked.  Try to justify it.  Or who wants me to put up a Part D. That is neither one to one nor onto.  It's one of the other or both.  Okay, let's see if you guys have changed your minds here.  Okay, good. It is one-to-one. Well, you can change colors of love.  Wow.  Wow, so nice Okay good f is not onto.  Anybody Give Me a Reason?  Exactly. You can't it doesn't matter to anything that doesn't have just zeros and ones right for this this maps to a very small sets subsets of the real numbers to find the right every every set can be mapped to a real number but it's not on to is it 1 2 1 Let's kind of give a brief justification question.  About the Auntie Barbies, but it doesn't matter to 0 and 100 for example.  Let's say it like this for example.  No set Maps.  two 1/3 for example  because the only set the only real numbers you can map to have to only consists of zeros and ones.  Hey, so f is one-to-one. Okay, so let's kind of briefly go through an argument of why f is one-to-one. So  supposed  half of a is not equal to a half of be right we want to show.  A is not equal to B.  Here's the argument if F of a is not equal to F of B. Then that means they have to differ in at least one a bit or one digit rank.  suppose  the case  decimal  place  half of a  is different  then ever be okay. I mean that's that's something that we can all agree on right if these two real numbers are different. They're going to have different decimal expansions.  so  Okay.  Actually, let's be a little bit more specific. Let's suppose the case decimal place of f of a is equal to one and and it's different than f a b which is equal to 0 K is in a & K is not in be there for a is not equal to B.  That's one way to do it.  Okay, so f is one-to-one. And remember if a function is one to one that proves that the domain has the cardinality of the domain is less than or equal to the cardinality of the codomain.  This is what we conclude because the function is one to one. That's how we defined less than or equal to return about cardinalities.  So we've already shown that key of Z Plus is is uncountable. Now, we've shown that 01 has a bigger cardinality than that. It must be uncountable also.  I'm sorry.  No, that's what we just proved.  Well, if there's if there is a real number that has a digit other than 0 and 1 then there's no preimage. There's no set that will map to it.  It's not in the range of the function.  It is in the codomain, but we already talked about how this function is. Not on to which means there's a bunch of stuff in the codomain that we can never map to.  Which includes like 1/3 or really anything that has digits other than 0 and 1?  Okay, just have a few more minutes. It turns out that these sets have equal cardinalities, but you needn't you need to prove another direction for that, but we'll maybe we'll revisit that on Wednesday.  Okay for the remainder of the class I want to do one more.  One more proof that the set of real numbers is uncountable just first because this whole concept might be new to some of you and it might be nice to see different ways of proving the same thing. So, okay.  Talk proof by contradiction assume towards a contradiction that 01 is actually countable. Okay, so we're doing sort of the same.  The same strategy here where we're going to show that the interval 0-1 is uncountable and that will prove that all real numbers are uncountable the set of all real numbers cuz I'm come. Okay. So suppose that this is countable by definition. There's a bijection a bijection means that you can list them out.  list out all real numbers  Let's do it. Let's list them out. Okay.  And you can do this kind of generally but I think that it would be a little bit better if we actually listed them out like a specific example. Okay, so I said  There's a way you can list all real numbers. And here it is. You start with 0.246 8... And then zero and then 1/2 comes in right and then you do one one one one one and then you do 3480 and so on so I give you this list.  Now we're going to do is find a number D. That is not in this list.  Okay, we want to find a number a real number D that's different than every single number in this list. And how do we do it? You guys might?  I have a clue from this word. Maybe you've seen it before.  but we're going to do is  look along the diagonal like this.  Okay.  And change every number.  We are going to do it in a in a specific way, but just for now just think about changing every number to maybe one number a bigger right so.  the number  0.31 to 1 and so on is not going to be found in this list, right? Because this number differs from every number in the list.  In that position right in at least one position.  kind of the idea  Okay, so we're going to find a number D.  We just have to choose DPI to be different from d-ii.  For example, like I said before.  I know I put II.  Oii is because it's the diagonal entry. I was thinking Roman numerals for some reason is not 7 then you can make the i7.  By this definition D cannot equal any of the real numbers in the list there 4D is not in the list. Therefore app is is not  It's not onto it's not a bijection.  Can't find any questions about that.  Okay.  Let's just circle the conclusion hear the set 0-1 is uncountable. This implies that the set of all real numbers is uncountable. Guess what's right right like this.  Okay.  All right. So just a few more minutes. I want you to start thinking about this proof or this statement. The set of irrational numbers is countable or is not countable.  What's have a little bit of a discussion here? Anybody have any comments who says? Yes.  It is countable.  Who says no.  Oh wow.  Okay of among you people who say no can anybody give me a reason a justification?  Play every rational number.  And map it into the real numbers.  No, it's okay.  I want you guys to think about this for next time. Okay, think about.  If it's irrational, I mean if it's uncountable why.  well  Could you it's kind of different right? Because the there are rational numbers that have infinite decimal expansions.  I guess there's something unique about it though, right? They have to repeat.  But if you could if you can work that into your proof then yes, but there's kind of a more simple way to do this.  No, because you could use that same argument to say that the rational numbers are uncountable and we prove that they are accountable.  But then how does that?  How does that prove that it's uncountable? "
