    "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started.  so  so I normally do the other light sure but miles is out of town today. So you got me for today and will be continuing with some little quieter, please.  Will be continuing with some uses of modular arithmetic and then I'll also be going over a few of the last homework problems just to get some extra examples of some of those things.  So start with what we talkin about the euclidean algorithm, which is used for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. So your goal is to find the largest number with his multiple of G and B is also a multiple of  So just to make sure we're all on the same page with what we're talking about. Steak cook a clicker question. What is the gcd of 50 and 70? What is that greatest common divisor?  Click in if you haven't yet.  Hi, there was General agreement on this one that it would see which is correct. So I am not because all of these are in fact divisors.  of  A&B 25 is not a divisor of both A and B. It's a divisor of 51 out of 70 and then of the things are divisors 10 is the biggest of them.  So in some some reason that we might want to find greatest common divisor is include if we're reducing fractions or often times in cryptography. It's useful to have relatively prime pairs of numbers numbers that don't share any factors until it's important to check that the gcd is equal to 1  So here is our algorithm for finding greatest common divisors and feel the weight with his run through this with an example. We just had a and d were 50 and 70 from the previous slide.  And so will create this list of decreasing numbers will start with A and B will make sure to put them in decreasing order. So c0 is 70 c 153 maximum and minimum respectively.  and then we're going to repeatedly take laws so see to  is equal to C 0 mod V1.  which is  70 Mach 50, which is 20  And then C3 real similar to take them all out of the previous two.  so that's going to be  50 + 20 what is equal to 10 and then finally see for will again take them out of the previous 220 mod 10 minutes equal to zero.  And so he's repeatedly take mods with the decreasing sequence of numbers and eventually went 0 and whatever you got right before 0-1 term in the sequence right before we do this case. That's 10.  Questions on the definition of this this algorithm. I was just ran through it.  I'll go through Wyatt works in the moment.  All right. So the claim is that  Masago them always works. It'll always get us the greatest common divisor of any two numbers.  So the proof of that is proof is going to be in two parts. We want to show that the result is in fact a divisor of and what's the greatest divisor?  I'm so glad I didn't mean those two pieces.  so  It's our first I first subclaim is going to be that it is a divisor of A&D.  so  so a is a multiple of 7 - 1.  and  he is a multiple ocn minus one.  And we're going to do this using strong induction to prove something is true about all the elements of this sequence.  So  so we're actually improve is someone if they're somewhat stronger statement as multiple.  So we're going to show.  run the show that every single every single item in that sequence is a multiple of c and -1  and if we can do that, well, then c0 is one of a or b and c one of the other one and so we will have successfully shown that A and B are each multiples of seeing - 1  The question lot questions why this is all we need to show for this part.  Let's go ahead and show that then.  so  a strong induction  Sorry, babe cases.  I'll show that.  directions to do this in reverse order  We want to show fee in and seeing when it's 1.  are multiples of c and -1  alright, so  CN equals what time CM -1  what is what is the value of CN at the end of this algorithm always?  02 CNN is in fact a multiple of same - 180 * - 1  and  and then see a minus one is definitely a multiple of itself.  I forgot that the elements at the very end of the list are definitely multiples of  so now let's do the inductive step for this.  so  stop  we're going to  throw in a 6K  and assumed they were doing strong induction here.  Got a whole bunch of it's true for whole bunch of these elements all at once.  assume that  CU + - k  + - k + 1  all the way up to  are all  multiples of 8 and -1  And now we want to show.  That Theo and minus K plus one.  It's also a multiple.  so  How is how are these? How is Asia how is it related to our other? We have see if N - 2 + 1 +.  How is it related to the other seeing values in his algorithm?  So we keep on using this rule to compute new elements of the sequence.  so what we have is  sea of hand- K plus one easier to look at it this way minus.  is equal to  Sears in landscape plus one  vaad CNN - k  that we take we always take the element to two two faces earlier mod by the one one space earlier to get like the current one.  Here we have here. We have that two faces earlier one place earlier and the current.  so that's going to that equation is going to be true just because of the way the algorithm runs that's just directed reading it out of a logarithm and then  we can apply the inductive hypothesis. So  this one is still unknown. That's the thing. We're trying to prove something about.  But the others are all within our inductive hypothesis.  Do we know?  We know that feeling when is K?  is a multiple of 7 - 1 so write this as a a a  CMS one  I know right? This one is  b - 1  that's also in our inductive hypothesis.  And so we can then using the definition of mod.  I have that.  See you then minus K plus one.  equal to  song multiple  of  Plus the remainder.  armendariz  d  10 - 1  the finely that is been just  She ready for Speed.  So I knew I liked a new item in. The list is in fact, some integer times are greatest common divisor thing at the end. We're trying to prove is the greatest by Sia.  The questions on this so far.  All right. So that's that's one of the two things we needed. So except we showed that it is sung divisor of A and B.  And now what makes it the greatest divisor they Indie maybe it's just another device ER maybe it's one many divisors of A and B, perhaps. So how do we know that this value is is the greatest common divisor.  so  I'll be the other stop playing.  and it's going to be  Bellevue  Also rather than greater than or equal to.  the greatest common divisor  and it is a divisor and is also at least as big as the greatest common divisor, then it must be the greatest common divisor.  So so I can prove this stop playing right here, then we're done.  questions on that  So let's go ahead and prove this one and again and prove by induction using a stronger claim.  So I could show that.  every  t i e s a  multiple of  tcda be in order to stop writing GTA V all the time. I'm going to rename that thing G. So every CI is a multiple of it. And if everything. - 1  Well, it's it's nonzero. And so if it's a multiple of G the smallest I could possibly be is Angie. So it's at least as big as G.  personal map  so let's go ahead and prove this one.  And again, it's going to be strong induction.  So these cases that cheetahs survive to zero.  And she at the Divide see one. This is what we want to show.  So, how do we sell is there algorithm again up in the corner?  How do we know that c0 and C1 are both multiples of G?  GSP greatest common divisor they Envy  what are the values of c 0 in C one in some order?  I heard someone.  Yes, is there and see one or just a n? D I don't know which is which but she didn't see one. One of them is the bigger of the two ones the smaller of the two so hard to stay and be  And by definition A and B are multiples of any divisor of A&D as I mean for something to be a divisor the greatest common divisor or any other device. Is that is that Andy Arnold both of them? So  C0 and C1 are A&B.  AR  multiples of G  by definition of g  question.  Heist now, let's do  inductive step  so  we're going to  I guess I should buy pics.  XK  and assume that  c0 C1 through c k  are all multiples.  pubg  First time wax during induction and sort of the more normal directions starting from zero going upward.  It's now.  We want to show that the k + 1.  He is also multiple G.  I'm approved for this is going to look very similar to the previous one since we know that.  See if k + 1 is equal to.  see if King - 1 mod apk  and so we can write that down as  CK minutes Juan equals Sun multiple of this Plus  the remainder  and then we'll just rearrange this towards the thing we actually care about.  CK + 1 equals  16 - 1  -2  CK and then finally by the inductive hypothesis, we can replace each of those other Seas by some constant * G.  This is baby. Not to hypothesis kg - to Fiji.  Is it once again? We having multiple G.  I said at the end of this proof.  So just some further examples using induction and modular arithmetic questions on it.  All right. A bit different.  So when do zero knowledge proof on this is kind of another sort of cryptography type concept used in protocols stay on the internet. If you are some user and say you want to like convince a website that you that you have some password without actually sending the password or something like that.  So I really I really like the word proof is a little bit misleading in in $0 proof on because the  ABC you weren't convinced. This is  this is really more of a probabilistic statement.  You want to convince up to some threshold of probability? Maybe maybe just 99% maybe 99.9 a real proof. It doesn't actually convince someone 100% but it'll be close enough.  So I have here a example of what I'm talking about. It's a non math examples first, cuz I think it's a bit simpler than me math when I have coming up next bus if I'll be playing the role of Bob here. I have two markers that one red one blue tentacle to me. So maybe I can identical. How would you play the role Dallas convinced me that these two are actually different that you can tell them apart. So what are we going to access to other people University Electronics? You just have to do some kind of interaction with me that will convince me. You can tell them apart. Are you first talk with your neighbors for a minute see what you can come up with and then I'll take some suggestions.  so  how's it going over here and it isn't a spot.  So does anyone want to share what they come up with?  How do I restart this?  How do you  Parkersburg and cover the label clothes and has Bob shuffle them behind his back and bring it exactly one hour.  So for those who can hear it was going to label the two markers. So here I've done that little blue Post-it notes on them. And then so I set out so now I can't tell which is which and now I can repeatedly shuffle them and I say are you think you can tell the difference by which one is this one? You can answer it and you still think blue you can tell the difference is your every time I'm able to tell which is which so how many times should I do this before I get convinced do you think  That's a pretty arbitrary question. I mean, it's it's really up to me. I was skeptical I want to be right but each time I do it. I'm reducing the Chance by half that you could be tricking me because you can fax actually can't tell the difference between the two if they are in fact identical like I think they are then that every time I do this challenge, I think we wanted this you have a half chance of being wrong cuz you cuz you can't tell either and so are you with enough times have chance of being wrong to be right than 1/4 inch and 7/8 chance. So by the time I've done this a lot of times I can be as convinced as I want to be never 100% but I can be very convinced that you can in fact tell the difference which is which  11 need property of this kind of proves the first of all the new zero knowledge part to go back to the other definitions. So at the end of this at the end of this process, I'm convinced that you can tell the difference. However, other than that I should have learned nothing new in particular. I still can't tell the difference without my labels and not only that I can't even convince someone else that you can tell the difference if I showed a video tape, like if I paint the whole process and I said look at that every time I pull this out every time they were able to tell which it was a skeptic. Could you say Advance which one you bought each time doesn't prove anything. So  So sexy like really does $0. I haven't learned anything. Other than that, you can tell the difference not the kind that you can actually do. I say protocol on the internet. However, now I have a version of this that you could do over the Internet so I can bring our modular arithmetic back in so  Alice has three numbers that Raji p and X that she chose. However, she wanted to pretty much needs to be a prime.  So I'll students of numbers and compute GTX Monte.  And then shares most of the numbers publicly GP and why?  Now as we discussed briefly at the end of last class it's so they it's just kind of an assumption in cryptography that there is no no feasible way of computing a even when you know why G&P that is still just takes way too long to compute X, we're not we don't have a proof of this but no one has yet found a fast algorithm for computing acts as long as these numbers are really big obviously Pinchos in a one-digit numbers here. You can just brute force and figure out what exit is but if these are all instead like 300 digit numbers modern computers just can't answer this and we don't have any clever solution. So even after revealing GP and why is still a secret from everyone other than Ellis,  so now  Hidalgo, Alice is the only person in the world who knows accent so she can prove her identity by revealing that she wants tightened and then it's easy. It's once you have exit easy to check but it's the correct number. What's the problem with this plan?  What's the problem with identity verification skiing needs to prove her identity. She just shows x two people.  Why does it not work?  Write this is a scheme that work. Once right one time. I was cuz they look on the real Alice he was X but but after that it stops working kind of horribly too and also proved.  So take two.  We're going to have to do this sort of zero-knowledge proof thing. You have to prove that, you know X without actually revealing it in the same way as you like, if you prove that you know, which marker is which without actually explaining how you're figuring it out that actually making me no longer colorblind. So  So we were going to do that is similar modular arithmetic.  So each round of this interaction in the same way as they were rounds in the marker thing, right each round opal at one marker and you would answer something and then get a new round and plot a new marker. So here  each round Alice is going to choose our new random number are and compute this GTR HP and reveal see reveal what the value of Monty has the same arguments before the Bob now knows see cuz it was just revealed in the GNP because those were shared earlier, but we're still going to assume that our can't be computed and reasonable. Of time by Bob the Bob still doesn't know our  And now Bob has has so he's just a summary. Again. Alice now has two secret $16 and then there's a GP why and see that are all public.  And now bought us two choices dog can either ask for our directly and Alice will give it to him or ask for the value of this weird thing.  Call Lindsay and Alice will give that to him.  so  and then bulking check that that what you've been told so far makes sense. So if I'm in fact asked for and gets r  Then now Bob has CGR and pee and so once you have all the numbers, it's easy to check that the equation holes. And so that everything else did so far was on the up-and-up and did in fact have those numbers.  and if instead  then he'll be verifying his other equation. Let's go through this briefly why it works so  oh, we have c y  my P equal to  the definition of c was g2br  Marty  the definition of why was PDX  Marty  so and I'm in this entire thing.  We're taking Monte.  I know.  What rule of modular arithmetic can I use to simplify this a little bit?  Are doing multiplication Almaty by the same thing. So we had a rule from a previous class that a d law 10 is equal to  Baymont Inn  Dean Martin  not in fights or is it take this one to live in reverse?  And get rid of these extra monkeys.  so  get G to the ERG to the x  Monte otherwise known as due to the x + r  Lucky, I'm doing part of this prove. I will not be able to prove to you for this is just a theory on like if it was a problem. This would have been.  Which is you can put in a multi minus one up there.  so  Better quality is due to if you want if you want to look up why that's legit.  Yeah, something called 4 mods little theorem.  So and then finally that is just  cheetah the Z  puppy  so so that's that's why these two quantities t y Monty and Monty should be equal to check that they are actually equal.  so  So no matter what no matter which one. Ask for the check he can perform to make sure that the numbers he's been told so far makes sense. However the number that isn't Old Faithful by itself. Are you thinking to use to check that. Things make sense? But it is itself just a random number if you ask for R&R was chosen at random. I was the definition for our if you have for this thing, this thing is also actually completely random because we just we had me start with something that isn't random mix but then we just add in a completely random number are the result becomes completely random.  And so to all Alice is actually told David they completely random number so don't doesn't know anything new about what exit is but I got us some information to start checking that things are working out and the part I won't be proving here is that if Alice does not actually no accent is trying to cheat here on Alice can prepare for either one of these two queries, but not both so to bother at a half pants either asking for or Z that have chance to choose the right one that I was won't have an answer that will check out.  Homicide just like the marker case each time. You do it one round of this. You can become more and more convinced that I will see. It doesn't fact know everything she claims to know.  Any questions on this?  All right.  So in the remaining time in today's class. I just wanted to go over whatever you all thought was hardest in the previous homework, so  Then we will be posting solution soon as well. But I think you're doing it to you so he can work the first one. It was structural induction.  The second one was all of those figuring out whether things are finite countably infinite or uncountable.  A third one was the one with that binary relation.  And the storage plan was to modular arithmetic. So why don't you vote with your clickers? Which one you'd like to see? So ABCD 1 2 3 4 and we can start discussing that one.  specific questions  I know you're running a b c d 1 2 3 4.  All right, thinking sensibly well is a slight slight majority for two with a second most likely, and III I will do some of each of those So within to vote again, so now it's actually the letters here. I guess you can't vote for us to get enough buttons, but you can vote for a b c d r e I will do that one.  I want to make sure I get to at least three.  so  All right, it's pretty even I guess I guess what we doing most of most of them maybe so I won't be writing out formal proof Sunday slides you can wait for the day when was supposed to Solutions later today or maybe tomorrow you can see each other and how we prove it. So starting with a sew a it's got this codomain are you might be able to guess that it's probably uncountable because there but that's not enough by itself to prove it and and this one's actually so so huge you don't even know where to begin off and write like this. The number of functions is a whole lot of functions from Zita are the trick for this one is choosing a manageable subset of of your set, which you can still prove is uncountable.  is s  then we're taking new set.  So maybe I'll just plan on you said it's only okay for no good reason but k b  set of  all  functions  the map  all integers to the same real  Supreme example if I have the function f of x equals pi  F will be in K because mapping every single integer to just one real pie and it has some other function like they f of x equals x + 1 / something different letter G then G is not in K because real  so now I have this subset queso questions on how I'm defining k  So so this is a thumb set of all the functions and yet it should be a lot easier to show why this one is uncountable because I can set up my bijection as follows. Like I got a function f of x equals pi and I will put that in correspondence with the real known as pie and I have another function f of x equals 0.1 and I'll put the correspondence with the real name of 0.1 and so on.  I saw every one of these functions is getting map to exactly one real and vice versa.  Hi, this is an invertible. This is a by Jackson between these functions and the real you can take a function to get a real we can also take a real and get a function right I start with a real start with route to I can work backwards and figure out what the function is it the function f of x equals root tip.  Should I put my Jackson so so what this what this proves then is that the size of K is equal to the size of our  so  and then well s is at least as big as k  right because because Kelly was chosen to be a subset of us.  And so I mean that I said at least as big as our which means is uncountable.  The challenge with this one is just like it was so uncountable is even bigger than anything. We've never talked about even start. So make it more manageable find find some subset of what you can work with any questions on that.  All right. So may be able to idle p2b is kind of a trick question. We know like we know as a fact.  Z  is strictly smaller than the real.  now if  so I guess I just keep on calling things past it suppose so if s is nonempty, that means there exists a one-to-one function with domain are in codomain z  Then we would have that the reals.  Electrical to see this is this is Paul and there are not at the wheels are strictly bigger than Z.  And so and so therefore this in the contradiction so acid, in fact the empty set. So for be there be there are no one to one functions from Arden be until  questions on that  Panthers vs. Finite  Because because the set in question, I just said SVU is the empty set and the empty set is finite.  I so so it's sort of a trick question because it sounds like I'm asking about some large set of things the set of all functions matching certain criteria, but they're actually no functions.  So it's the only one on here that the rest were all figuring out which an infant it is.  Think I'll do one more of these and then we'll do some of 3 to make sure we have time for that. So let's do  What time is it at all possible JavaScript programs? So?  JavaScript  so so often times when we're proving that something is countably infinite. Wish this one is a lot to be done in two parts. So  So it's on his so-called again. I'll just keep calling it that.  so  so if praying for some clean is going to be that he's in fact infinite.  and then  later on.  I will also prove that.  That ass is countable.  And then the two claims together.  enough to show that f is equal to  Play pots and so it's countably infinite structure for one of these proofs. Usually the first part showing that it is infinite at all is usually not too difficult. So, for example, we can have a  let  fmn equal  the program  that  Prince  high end times  Hi, the definitely a program that prints high once is definitely a separate program. They'll print out the word hi twice and so on so there are infinitely many programs.  So this is  f is  one to one  from  G+ to us  questions on that  So again again just feel kind of like the previous case it often helps to look at a subset or superset that's easy to count all programs kind of hard to count but the sub data program started doing something very specific either one time or two times or three times that's easy to see that it's infinite cuz they're all different programs.  So that that one and then to show that it's a show that it is.  The show that it is going to deal with a super sad so every s is a strict subset of K.  Work a cassette of all strings with valid symbols and maybe we'll have numbers in there and we'll have letters in there and we'll have some other symbols in there, but there are under the stars.  So there are finite number of different symbols that are allowed in a JavaScript program. There are a lot of them you can have letters you can have numbers you can have singles like less than but it is a finite set of symbols.  And so and so he sent it out. Okay. We're no longer going to worry about child with your programs. Now, we just think about all the strings using the set of symbols.  I want you to know I'll just say it and forget strings. We found a way to list. List and put them in order in some way. And then we want a longer and longer ones. You can do that with Vista two strings to start with all the one single strings like 0 and 1 and less than a program is super sad that it's all the strings then move on to the slightly longer string a tattoo symbols with them all out and so on so we can list it out. It's kind of  questions on that  Yes.  Yeah, so interesting way.  Right, so you can compute you can write individual. That was your programs that compute functions from domains. The Dakota main are however this what is truth actually show is basically is that there are some functions. He will not be able to write in JavaScript ever.  I definitely think that you can write you can write it down with your function that doubles things that you can write a function that everything the pie but necessarily there must be some function right because there are uncountably many functions and unaccountably many programs.  other questions on this desk  Yeah, so you can't actually write all of those that you can definitely write the program that I can try the individual program that multiplies one by pie or the individual program to help you talking about.  Yes, actually not all those are actually representable because how do you like how do you write the real itself in the program I so I can write him in. Krabs. He'll be like VAR ax equals 0.1. I can write that right. I can even write 0.1. I can write something like, you know math. Pie or something, right? So you definitely write some of these in JavaScript but there are real or which is nothing I can right there like some real thing and don't have any nice description. And so I said I won't exist to weigh to ride in Dallas or even though the real incest.  I cannot open up my head. I'll try to find it to you later. Sorry.  All right.  so  videos to do a quick part of three the most out of time. So let's do Rice have proven that is equivalence relation. So just please approve things. Like I'll just do symmetry quickly for all pay for all be so we want to show that ARB and Plies pra and this one is just like directly by the definition rights we have  FFA equals FMB doesn't imply that f a b equals F of a check and then and then equality itself is symmetric. So you're done part of this one is number.  What's the number to so we have one? So first let's see what this function actually does any of the scenarios. We have a function.  And if function map some stuff from A to B, then what are coolant relation is doing is it boxing things in a into equivalence classes based on whether they mapped the same element of B.  Hi. This is that's a that's B. And that right there is at the day and it's also have to be.  So if any is finite.  And it's partitioned into a equivalent size of a equivalence classes. The only way to split a finite set into size of that sat equivalent classes is to make every equivalence class have only one element.  So unlike the picture of tub. This picture has only one element for equivalence class.  And now we have RB and now because of the definition of our equivalence classes. Well, we can't actually if we ever tried to draw two arrows to the same one that knows when to come the same equivalence class. "
