    "Full Transcript": "Eyeglass, good morning.  Morning. Okay. Let's get started. What do you say?  What are learning goals today are to talk about what these things are the CNF in the dnf help you all in the homework?  Of a given compound proposition. So the idea here is that your given a truth table and you're supposed to kind of reverse-engineer it into some sort of compound proposition. Why would this be useful? Well, it will give you a way to like make a circuit if you need to that will or you can make any possible circuit that you want.  To give you any results and truth table.  So after that, we're going to move into something called predicate logic where we talk about these things called Universal and existential quantifiers to the end of the lecture today and we'll jump right in on that on.  Friday  okay, so  going backwards. I thought I'd give you a proposition. Hopefully by now. You'll be able to give me the truth table. So I give you a truth table. How do you give me a proposition?  Given a truth table do we want a compound proposition with that output. Now that you guys are already short of experienced the fact that you can have many different looking propositions that give you the same truth table, right? So the proposition is not unique to the truth table.  Of course, the truth table is unique writing mean is that's what it is. So when I give you a proposition and tell you to do a truth table, there's only one right answer if I give you a truth table and tell me give me a proposition. There are many right answers. So we're going to try to formalize what answers I want what what kind of form do I want my answers in? Okay.  Okay, so  Remember the frequency here is a b c n f and dnf conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form conjunctive.  That comes from the word conjunction.  Which is what?  together  Didn't like isn't it like a part of speech?  A conjunction is like a part of speech self and is a conjunction, right?  It's not what it is.  I don't know. I guess this is not a grammar class so you don't need to worry about that, but  If I maybe should have looked up the meaning of the words.  In math, we just Define the meaning to be the mack meaning right and then all the other stuff comes comes out of that. Okay, so conjunctive normal form is and of ores.  What does that mean?  It kind of means that.  You have these Clauses which are kind of like parts of the sentence are parts of the proposition that are all ended together and inside of each of the clock. They're all or together. My kind of makes sense.  I know that's this one.  How does it go  and of ores  And I pours yeah.  try these things are like  Really kind of confusing to me sometimes okay.  so it would be something like  Does something like you have?  Where's my pen?  You have like a bunch of oars inside a  parentheses and then you and another bunch of ores, right?  When you can and another one queso you kind of like string these together and what can go in these little spaces. Well, you could put like just letters or there or their negations right stuff like that. It's you can fill them up with those those things are called literals, you fill them out there with literals and that pee or something or something or something that whole quantity and something else like that.  Okay disjunctive form is the opposite you have the hands in the oars swapped question.  Which one?  The inside of that princesses know like inside the parentheses. You only have ORS and then you string those together with Anne's.  They're on their own like compound proposition. That's not allowed.  Your yeah, you can only have like the literal which are the kind of variables and their indications.  Okay.  So just jumped in normal form opposite.  Okay. So which of the following is a C in F?  Why did you guys already?  Figure this one out.  Okay. Wow.  most people are saying see  a good C certainly is conjunctive normal form a also kind of is too because you can just have it like this.  Because it's like you didn't do any of the oars. It's it's a it's a string of oars with only one literal. It's kind of like a edge case but  What kind of make sense?  Find depends on where you put the parentheses, right? So what was your suggestion?  Oh, that's what I meant. Yeah you right now it would be sorry. You're right. If I did it like this then it would be Sienna. Thank you. Thank you if I did it like this.  This would be dnf.  It's just kind of like how you group them. Yeah. Sorry about that.  What do you mean?  So you can have as a conjunctive normal form with only one clause and if you have it with only one clause and there's nothing to straining with.  Have you ever questions?  Right. You can rewrite B2B in.  What would it be?  Either one really, right but it's not written that way as we have it. Yeah, and we're going to show that you can write any compound proposition in one of these forms anyway, so for that matter, it really depends on how you write it out.  Okay. So how do we go about reverse engineering a truth table?  Okay, so I'm going to give you a few approaches. The first approach is what we can do is kind of single out one of the variables like for example p and see that P is true in all of these places and it's false in all of these places. Right so we can kind of condition on if p is true then do this if p is false then do that kind of one way to do it because if we do it that way.  then and noticed that q and are you just kind of have these like  mini truth tables here, right?  So if p is true then what is going to be what what is q&r?  You'll have to put it in conjunctive normal form. Is there a another compound proposition you could say?  for this one  Q  Or implies Q. How about this one?  not qu  how about  not are not q and r  turn like that.  What's the first one?  wait  Harris Faulkner  for this one  This is fine. True implies, true false implies true false. Implies Falls.  Is it going to work?  Okay.  cancel  Now what we can do is write this whole thing here as p and or implies Q Sookie true and R implies Q is true. And then this one we can write as not p and not q and not are those those are kind of descriptions of those two halves. So, how do I String them together?  Do I String them together with and or do I String them together with an oar?  Or write one of these things need to be true so I can do this or Aunt or this isn't in any form yet. But this is one way you could kind of approach it is by doing it is by splitting it up like that any questions.  All right approach to algorithmically and convert it to normal form. Okay. So this is what we're going to do.  I want to know.  When is this thing going to be true? Okay, so let's highlight all the true.  values  Okay. So what I want to do is basically land in these rows when I do my compound proposition, okay, and so I can kind of pick and choose which ones I want.  This we want to land in these rows. So we're going to use a dnf. When is the output t Okay. So this first one is it true when p q and R are all true so we can right next to this when we can write p and Q and r p and Q and R are all true, then that's true. And if that was my only compound proposition, my truth table would have a true up top and if everything else would be false, right?  So think about that for each one. This one would be p and Q and not r  p and not q and not far.  And then just think about these these Clauses might these little Parts each one of these when you look at their truth table, they only have one true and everything else is false to attend of zeroing in on each one of those troops.  I just want to be not pee and not  Q  and our  So I want one I want I want one of these to be or want all of these to lead to a True Value. So how do I String them together?  With orders right? It's either this compound proposition is true or this compound proposition is true or this one is true or this one.  And then we get this whole thing here.  And this isn't dnf form.  Okay, so you can you can just do this for any truth table. The number of true that has will give you the number of Clauses, right? And each Clause will have a a literal for each one of the variables. Now. This is a very long thing here. It's much longer than what we had before, right?  When we kind of did it by splitting up the peas so it's not necessarily the most simplest but what's nice about it is that it's in it's in its own form. And so you can if you only had or xan's and not to work with you can always build a circuit.  Okay.  so  Now this is what we did was we tried to figure out when it was true.  Another way to think about it is let's think about when it's false. Okay, so we want to avoid these rows.  Okay to remember what we did before where we kind of honed in on all of the True Values and we had this string of ants so that the result.  The resulting truth table of that just that Klaus would have a true and one of the rows and false is everywhere else.  I'm going to do kind of the opposite where I build something that has a false in one of the rows and Truth everywhere else.  So  let's look at this route in particular.  I don't want this to be true. I want this to be false. Okay, so it would be true.  would be pee and  not qu  and  AR  but I want the negation of that.  produces anybody remember the law that that allows us to kind of  Distributing the negation  demorgan's law and I know we only kind of Define demorgan's law for to literals, but you can kind of distribute it through the whole thing here is equal to or is logically equivalent to what  Not P or Q or r?  Usher  Any questions about that?  p and Q and r  p and Q and R would be false in that Row for sure. But what I want to have is something that falls in that row and true everywhere else.  Cuz then we're just going to end them all together, right?  So the idea here is that I want I want.  I want this thing to be false and the next row to be false and the next rotary Falls and the next rugby Falls.  Okay, so that's kind of the idea here. You can do it with the bottom row you get not not p and not q and not all that turns into P or Q or r?  And so that's how you get these for false values. Okay. Now kind of the the quick way to do it is just do the opposite of the of the truth table columns, right? If p is true then put not P if Q is false input.  Q what's the opposite of not?  knock knock  And if you have t put not far it's like you kind of like a reversing the roles and then you and all of these things together.  any questions  So, this is CNN.  conjunctive normal form  and this is how it looks okay, it turns out that  This is the same truth table as before. So this is a different compound proposition. That describes the same truth table as the first one but what's nice about it is that it has this nice structure, right? It's all kind of organized and easy to read.  any questions  Alright, so what's the pay on the output column of a truth table right can be realized as a compound proposition?  and  sort of a consequence of this right if you believe that you can always do this for any truth table is that this set of 3 operators is functionally complete and or and not and functionally complete means you can you can make any truth table you want any combination of zeros and ones or any combinations of Truth and false has to all that other stuff biconditional exclusive or implies.  What else did we have?  XOXO are all that stuff is not necessary to build every single truth table, but the * 8 * it's just kind of nice to have because it makes things simpler.  So another sort of consequence that we can use it for that. We probably won't do today. But you will you might see in the future is that if you want to talk about an arbitrary circuit or an arbitrary to truth table, you can just assume that it's in a conjunctive normal form because I know that there is this algorithmic way to turn it into there and then you can do sort of a approve about this arbitrary structure. So it will be easier to do that.  Okay, so  If you want if you start out with some compound proposition and you want to turn it into normal form, I think the best way to do that is through the truth table. So, you know, if you had like a p implies Q if and only if our something like that we don't have any hands indoors, but you want to make a circuit out of it. You could turn it into a truth table. And then from the truth table is easy to go to CNN for Tiana.  Okay.  Let's switch gears little bit. We're going to go into these things called predicates and quantifiers. Okay. So this is getting into predicate logic and predicate logic basically is logic with a variable this kind of one way to think about it. Okay. So a predicate is informally it's a proposition with a hole need some information to to assign it a truth value a lot of predicate. You'll see in mathematics. A lot of them. You'll see in like high school algebra and stuff like that. You'll say something like any of X is the predicate X is greater than 3 now. This predicate has no True Value because X have not been defined but it has a truth value depending on what exes.  So kieu of X would be something like Hugh of X is the word X contains a letter the letter a drink. So I'm not telling you what the word is yet. It's kind of just the whole in there that you have to fill in okay.  So access different possible values depending on the predicate and it was in the predicate itself can only really have a true or false value depending on what x you put it.  Let's look at this predicate.  Peter backs is x squared minus 4 is equal to 0.  Is there some value of x which makes p of X true which one of these statements is, correct?  We caught they each kind of hit on a different concept that we're going to talk about in for the rest of the class, I guess.  Okay, I see you.  kind of have a 50-50 here almost between c and e  Let's go through them.  Yes, all integer values of X make p of X true.  Is that a true statement know why not?  Okay, so one squared minus 4 is not equal to 0 right saw we provided a counterexample. This one does not work.  Was that you can solve for x and see what it is to sure.  Okay, how about be?  Yes, there's exactly one positive integer value of x that makes this predicate evaluate Tutti. What is that value positive to okay, if I say 2 squared? Okay. So this is true. This actually is true. But if I say OK 2 squared - 4 is 0 good. Is that enough to prove it?  Rights, because it says exactly one right but this kind of goes into what we're going to talk about maybe starting on Friday, but we might get into it today is when you when you talk about a predicate, it's really important to talk about what is the domain what types of X values are you allowed to put in? Okay, so there is exactly one positive integer. And then how about this one? How about sea?  also true because you have 2 squared - 4 0 and you also have negative 2 squared - 4 0  queso the nature of the predicate kind of changes depending on the domain if my domain is only positive integers. There's only one solution if it's all integers, then there's two solutions and stuff. Haha. Just be be aware of that.  Okay, how about D?  Also true same thing with the domain right this one you can actually prove because you can say Okay P of -1 is false.  P of 0 is false  And P of one is false.  Okay, and these are kind of like it it's like this and this and this right because one is false and P of zeros pause and fear on his fault. That means that there are no values in there that are true.  Okay good. So, yeah, it's all these three are acceptable and and you're right cuz they're they're based on the domain. But if I just said  To answer this question is I said, is there some value of x which makes p of X true if I said no here?  It kind of depends on the domain question.  So  I feel like the question asking for the more general form. Where is there an answer to this equation?  Yeah, I guess I'm just trying to show you that it has different answers depending on the domain cuz I didn't specify domain right but in each of the  Question quicker answers there is a domain specified. And so if you use each one of those then you can you can say for sure. But yeah, you should be careful about that specially when you're doing your predicate a lot. Once we start getting into it. A lot of the times will kind of have a universal domain depending on what type of question we're doing, but for now, let's try to always  specify the domain  I never questions.  Yeah.  yeah for this one is e  cuz all b c and d are all true are all correct.  I guess like if you want like a simple yes or no answer. It's kind of hard to say because of the the different dumb.  domains  Okay, so  listen to do some more notation. And so this is something called a universal quantifier and it is denoted by this upside down.  and you can think about think of that as meaning like for all okay, so  for all upside down a means  for all  cancel. X for all values of X in the domain, so  Of course, we need to specify the domain and usually will do that at the beginning of the problem or maybe even inside of the notation. But the idea this thing here is red.  for all X in the domain. Exit true  That's what that statement says.  Okay, so  let's look at this.  if I have P of X being log to log base 2 of X is less than x  appearex is log base 2 of X is less than x and the domain is integers greater than one, okay.  then  for all x p of X is true because every integer greater than one follows like has the property that log of x is less than x  So these Universal quantifiers something like this, you have the universal quantifier, you have your variable and then you have your predicate that's kind of how that you build them. And that whole thing is a proposition because it has a truth value. Now. Remember the predicate had this hole in it that you had to fill in the Universal quantifier is a way to kind of fill in that hole by asking is it true for every single value in the domain?  case of similarly  if P of X is x squared is greater than x  this whole thing is going to be false when the domain is all real numbers y because  there is a  number  for example  What's an example that would would would make this false?  like 1/2  for example 1/2 because 1/2 squared is less than 1/2, right so  So if I give you a counterexample if I give you just one example, that is not true.  Then it proves that the whole thing is not true because not true for everything will get into that a little bit later to.  Peso to prove to disprove a universal statement. You have to give a counterexample, which is an element of the domain and which makes the predicate.  Okay.  So let's go into the next Universal the next tsutsumi the next quantifier, which is called an existential quantifier. So existential quantifier is this backwards  it stands for there exists.  GameStop there exists an element in the domain such that P of X is true or such that p a text. Okay. So let's look at these things again. If P of X is x squared greater than x and the domain is all real numbers. This is true, right?  So because for example 2 squared is greater than 2 and 2 as a real number that means that makes the whole thing true.  So just like the universal quantifier. I just end up quantifier is a way to kind of fill in that Gap.  By talking about the whole domain.  Okay. How about this one there exists an X such that P of X is false.  1 P of X is x squared + 1 is equal to 0 and the domain is all real numbers. Why is that because there does not exist a number in there?  every number that you plug in every real number you plug into this will be.  I want to go until I complex numbers, but that's not in our domain. Right so just like before it's important to  To say what your domain is in order to answer the question unambiguously.  Yes.  for this  this one  Yeah, you're right. The number is in between -1 and 1 this will be false right? I guess excluding zero including zero.  But what I'm saying here is this backwards. He says if there exists some number out there in the real numbers that makes it true.  There may be many that make it fall. But if there's one that makes it true then this whole proposition is true.  Okay. So for the existential ones you kind of have to sometimes do a more to prove it to be true. You have to give a construction you have to show that there is something in there that makes it true.  Just like we did.  Okay, any questions about that?  Okay. Now I'm going to try to kind of Link these quantifiers to what we've done before so let's think about these many and it's okay. So what if I said something like every student in this class has a clicker.  I hope that's true.  right  What's another way to write that?  One way would be saying that P of x.  Is the statement student X has Clicker?  the domain  Is this class?  So this would say for all x p x  that's one way to say it and it's nice and succinct.  another way to say it is  can I have a volunteer?  Okay, what's your name Chris?  Okay, can I have another one?  Emerson  can I have another one?  What is it Eren?  How much time do we have? Can we go through the whole class here?  8 minutes we could try.  notice notice that this is also I mean if I keep on doing this  this is also a  This is an equivalent a logically equivalent statement. Is it not?  Okay. So this this is a nice way to kind of make that succinct make it smaller make it in like a nice notation. And also think about well, it's kind of hard to think if the class were an infinite class, but we will be dealing with infinite sets here and there and we talked about integers real numbers things like that. And so this is a way to kind of encapsulate all those infinitely many objects or elements into one universal quantifier. And so I don't have to say this is true for one and this is true for two and this is true for 3 Aunt right you can you can do it all at once. Okay, so similarly  Crazy with my pen up here. You could do this with the exit existential quantifier right in this one. I'd say let's say that the domain is the class.  And Q of X is student.  X has a dog. So this would be there exists X such that Q of X how you say it.  I don't know if this is true.  Does anybody want to prove me wrong?  Anybody want to prove to me that this is true.  You have a dog. Okay, this is true.  What is your name Muhammad? Okay, so Muhammad.  Oh, man, what happened?  has a  Dog, that's true. But what is this whole sentence if I needed to do the whole thing? It would be Muhammad has a dog or  Chris has a dog, right?  Or Emerson has a dog.  Or Etc. Existential quantifier list of ores and Universal quantifier just a list of hands.  Let me just do something real fast.  I want to introduce the the one last thing before we go.  Okay.  This is something to think about right and you can we can use those those sentences we had remember the the first one was for.  For all x p x that was for all students the student student X has a clicker. Okay. So what's going to be the negation of that?  Not for all XP of Acts. It's kind of like it's not the case that all students in this class have a clicker, right so we can translate that for all into a string of an right. So this will be not Chris as as clicker and Muhammad.  and Emerson  and... Right.  Now does this look familiar to you?  To familiar, right? So how do I translate that? How do I distribute in the the knots you or everything and not everything else? So this would be not Chris or not Muhammad?  or not Emerson  or...  Now we can translate that into a more succinct way. How do we say that?  Right there exists some student.  Such that it's not the case that that student has a quicker.  So I guess I should kind of box all this stuff. So these things are equivalent and it and it just follows right from the de Morgan. Okay, so early I guess and will start with this on Friday. "
