You know, I I was busy that day last minute thing. So.  The only person that I could find was Macho Man that that knew how to do the material, you know.  some  I first asked Ben of course, but he was busy so.  Macho Man  anyhow  What did you guys even do? Did you guys get any work done?  Or is it just having fun the whole time?  Any wrestling moves but you guys learned?  Did you did you learn how to do the figure 4 leg lock?  or a suplex  any volunteers know I'm not going to do any wrestling moves today.  Maybe I'll bring in somebody else.  another professional  Okay. So let's talk. Let's continue along with induction. We're going to do some more practice. I'm telling you. This is an important concept. I'm hoping that you guys learn it learn it. Well because it's going to come back again and again in all the other classes that I teach.  so  Okay. So what are we doing today? We're going to do some more mathematical induction. We're going to talk about something called structural induction if we get to it, which is  Kind of induction for SATs. We're going to start talking about recursive definitions how to cut a buildup certain structures recursively what weather it be sets or functions or something like that. We're going to just kind of do recursive stuff. But let's let's continue along with induction. So what we did last time to show that some statement is true for all non-negative integers. What you what mathematical induction does is you do your bases step, which is pruvit 4 p.m. 0  then  You need to prove this statement for all kpfk. Implied P of k + 1 and how do you set it up while we have this nice format for you. You do your bases step in this proof is usually like a trivial.  Or by inspection or something like that.  And yeah, so that's kind of the easy part then your inductive step. So I want you guys to write this in this format.  I guess you don't have to actually write the part in parentheses, but I want you to write this. I want you to write let K be an arbitrary fixed but unknown integer, or you don't have to you don't have to write this part. Let K be an arbitrary integer with K greater than equal to zero. This is this is like a universal thing that you always right for these kind of induction. We're going to change induction as it as we go. But if it's in this for me, I want you to ride it like this. We're going to get to something called strong induction where we change this a little bit but at least for now, this is how I want you to ride it.  Cancel always have to kind of start with an arbitrary integer.  then  write out your inductive hypothesis assumed it to be true and then show the proof.  Okay. So for this next kind of example, we're going to be talking about sizes of infinite sets. So if a SUV sizes of finite set, so the set is finite that means that has finitely many distinct elements.  Okay, if there are n elements then we say that.  That this is equal to end to equal to end. Okay. So this is like the absolute value signs instead of absolute value. We call it.  cardinality  what's the cardinality of the set if the number of distinct Elements which one of these.  Let's say the universe is the set of all real numbers.  Okay. Which one do you guys say?  A&C good  let's go like that. I get rid of it. Okay is the empty set. What is the cardinality of the empty set?  0 good. All right, see what is this set?  The set containing What?  0 and 1 right? That's it.  And what's the cardinality of this stat?  2gud, okay, B and C are both. Excuse me. B&D are both infinite infinite sets.  questions  Evan it said it said that's not finite.  How is the find?  Okay operations on sets peso.  If I know the cardinality of a and the cardinality of B, how do I use that to find the cardinality of a union B?  was that  what do you mean to include it?  I like.  Okay. Yeah, so that's a good point. What happens with the overlap?  Okay, so good.  So  hey is true only for special cases. It's actually none of the above.  Okay, because if you count if you if you do a + b Cardinale baked with carne Levi, you're counting whatever is inside of the overlap two times.  That kind of answer your question. Actually the correct answer is this  Right, it's all day and all of us all of me and then subtract their intersection, which is that thing so that cuz if you just do this you count their intersection twice.  Right you do that guy. And then you have all of B.  Aren't you kind of that twice? So you have to subtract off that football?  And then you only counted it once so they are okay.  So in particular what happens if a and b are disjoint?  What is it?  Right, that means their intersection is empty.  And so that implies that  a union B  is equal to a + b  Disjoint you can just add them together right because you're not double-counting anything any questions about that.  Okay, I got it.  So let's talk about the Cartesian product for the Cartesian product. Remember is the set of all ordered pairs where?  The first entry comes from the first set second entry comes from the second set and you can kind of think about them as of coordinates in a way if you label the x-axis with all the elements from a and label the y-axis with all the elements from be then every element in the Cartesian product is a lattice point in that for a grid point in that.  Cartesian plane  Like for example this element here would be labeled. What a 3, B 3. It's just a coordinates.  queso  we have that let's talk about this. So it should make sense that the cardinality of the Cartesian product is the product of the car of the cardinalities.  make sense  I mean you can just see that by the grid right but let's prove it using induction.  Okay, so we're going to prove this statement. Now question is how much does a x b or a cross B?  Change the cardinality of a Crosby changed when we add one new element to a store replacing a with a set with an extra element in there a new distinct element.  All right, good. Let's see.  Okay, good. Most people are saying  Does be more elements that are added right? Because you have two pair that new element in a with everybody from bee questions.  All right. So, how are we going to prove this thing?  For any finite sets A and B carnelli across B is equal to the product of the cardinality. So let's change it into a form that we can use right change it into like the induction form. So for any non-negative integer n  if a is any set of size n  then for any other finite set be the Cardinale way across be is equal to the product. Now, we have it in the form we want. Okay, so we have our for all n and this statement.  This is Peterman.  I want to prove that statement to be true for all and  cancel  So let's prove by mathematical induction. So if the base is step is for end to be zero. Okay, you want to show that if cardinality of a zero than for any finite set B.  The cardinality of their cross product. The Cartesian product is equal to the product of the cardinalities.  And then the inductive step. This is how it's going to look.  Let K be a non-negative integer number. I told you you have to write that part KB a non-negative integer assume that for any set sea of size K&N all of this property and you want to show that for any set of size K plus one any finite set in any other five nights at their their Cartesian product follow this rule.  Let's go through the basis step. How would we show this?  It is true.  What what make what's true about it? Why is it why is it true?  So what so if a is 0 what does that mean a is equal to?  The empty set the empty set is the only set out there that has zero elements. So I have to be the empty set. Now. What is the empty set cross with any finite set?  Also the empty set. Why is that?  Are you at the pair everything from the empty set with everything in beat but there's nothing in the empty set. So there's nothing to pair with anything and be so there's nothing there.  Okay, and then to the cardinality of empty Crosby is cardinality of empty which is 0 and so this thing is true by inspection.  Guy questions about that  Help me with infinite. It would still be any set Cartesian product with the empty set is empty. No matter if it's infinite or finite or even the empty set, right?  All right. So let's do the inductive step.  Can we have our important let K be a non-negative integer assume that for any set sea of size K we have this thing. Hey, that's our inductive hypothesis.  Now or inductive step any set of size k + 1 so let a be a set of size K plus one. That's going to be the first line in your proof.  Let's say an arbitrary.  Cersei with the cardinality of a equals k + 1  The cardinality of a is equal to K plus one. That means we can write it out. It's finite we can write out all of the elements of K and some certain order write the order actually it doesn't matter here. But let's just pick a order. Let's say that these elements are if they were integers, you could put them in increasing order or if they were sets. You could put them in another order or something like that. So you can just basically what I'm trying to say is you can list them out in some way.  The list them out like this for we have X-14 SK plus one and you can rewrite this ass.  C+ the last element in your in your sequence right now.  What do we know about sea?  What's the cardinality of C?  Okay good.  So here's what we do.  Let be be any finite set. Then A cross B is equal to this thing here now.  Maybe you guys can kind of think about this as an exercise. Why is this true? Why is it equal to this? The idea is that we're going to pair all of the X1 through X cases with all of the elements of be right that's going to take care of C crappie. And then the rest of it is just going to be pairing that Xscape plus one with everything in b.  Now this these sets are disjoint, right?  Say it like this.  Disjoint sets so that means that they're the cardinality of their Union is equal to the sum of their cardinalities. How do we know for sure that they don't share any elements?  Exactly. She does not contain x k + 1.  And so it could never have an ordered pair that starts with Xscape plus one. Whereas the other set only starts with Xscape. So it's clear that their disjoint so we can do this.  We can split this up like that. We're allowed to do that because they're just joined now.  the inductive hypothesis gives us this  Why?  Biggest sea is a set of K elements and we said any set.  Any sexy with K elements in any finite said we get this this nice equality. So and then you just do algebra and you get to what you want, which is this basically to that, okay.  so  Then we're done. Are there any questions?  How did what?  One way to see it is see that see and the set containing Xscape plus one. Those are disjoint, right?  Basically C does not contain Xscape plus one and to see that these ones are disjoint.  Everybody in C Crosby.  The first element is going to come from c c does not contain k + 1 * x + 1 will never be the first element in any of those ordered pairs.  That's that's because that's because of this Deacon decomposition of a  What comes from that?  Rebuilt see in such a way so that it does not contain Xscape plus one.  Okay, let's move on.  Okay, we've talked about the power set right the power set of a set a is the set of all subsets.  okay, so if the set s is finite then  then what?  what is  The cardinality of the power set of ass. What is that?  Let's look at some examples.  Okay, if the if the set is empty.  Actually looks let's make a few.  Let's do the set and then the cardinality of the set.  Power set and then the cardinality of the power set.  Okay, so if the set is empty how many elements does it have?  0 right  the power set is the set containing the empty set how many elements does that have?  What good?  if the set  Only has one element. How many does the cardinality of the power set have to if it has two elements that has four three elements that has  I hate to think I see a pattern going.  Okay. So this is our observation the size of the power set increases by a factor of 2 for every new element of the set. In other words is cardinality of the power set is to to the cardinality of the set.  Okay, let's prove this using induction. What are you guys say?  Yeah.  Okay.  same format  if you want to start at at 0 right, let's just go over our  statement for all non-negative integers and right for all n greater than or equal to 0.  We have this statement here.  This is p of n  To Fresh we want to prove P of 0 which is which is will state if a is any set of size 0 there's only one set if the empty set is the empty set. Then the power set has size two to the zero, which is 2 to the 1 to the 0 is 1 and we've already shown this by inspection.  Okay now inductive step.  Let K be a non-negative integer. I know that's going to get I would really annoying to hear it every single time, but I want you guys to put that in there, too.  Okay, assume the inductive hypothesis assume the power set of any set sea of size K has size to the king.  Now, how do we prove it? Take an arbitrary set of size k + 1 show that the power set of that set aside to the k + 1.  Okay.  So we're actually going to do to use the same decomposition that we used before and we kind of went through it fast for the Cartesian product. But let me just kind of slowed down a bit so that you guys can understand. Why am I doing it this way? Okay, you start out with a set of size K plus one has k + 1 elements. I don't know any facts about sets of size k + 1 what I do know is about sets of size K, right? That's my inductive hypothesis. So this is a way to take pay plus one and shrink it down to K and you're going to see that sort of strategy a lot of the times when you're doing inductive proof. You're going to start out with some K plus one thing and try to get it down 2K because then when it's okay, you can use the inductive hypothesis kind of to move forward in order to prove it.  Okay. So what are the subsets of a?  Okay. So what is the power set of a?  Okay, well.  Since C is a subset of a right it's going to include C and all of the subsets of C, right?  Okay, what's left over?  Okay, good union, write it down here.  Power set of the day. It's going to be the power set of C Union with the set of all, let's call it a subset of a such that x k + 1 is an element of acid.  That makes sense.  Okay, are these set disjoint?  Yes, right.  Who can give me a justification for why they're disjoint.  right  and every set in this other set does have Xscape plus one.  Okay, so  That means that the power set of the power set of a cardinality is equal to the cardinality of the power set of C, right plus the cardinality of the set.  Okay now.  What do we know anything about the cardinality of the power set of C?  2 to the K that's the inductive hypothesis. Okay, so inductive hypothesis gives this  Okay. So now we have to figure out how many elements are in this set.  Anybody have any ideas?  So there's only one. I know there's more that's more than one element in their.  Plus one big exception plus morning to all of us.  Okay, good observation.  Let me rewrite the set.  It's the set of all.  Xscape plus one  Union let's call it t such that t is an element of  Or let's say it. Let's do it this way.  Yeah, let's say that though. Katie is an element of the power set of C.  What does must try to translate that what am I saying? I'm saying everything in the power set of C does not have Xscape plus one, right? We we've already established that.  So when we add Xscape plus one to each one of those sets we create this new set. Right and this is exactly the set that were trying to count.  Has the same cardinality, right?  Yeah for each set it for each subset of see. We're just adding a new element.  And then you got a bunch more. So this is also to the k.  done  High questions  The set on the right this set here.  This does not contain DMT set right because the way it's described as it's all of the subsets of a that contain x k + 1 the empty set does not contain next to a plus one.  Escapists escapists 1 with every other set in the UFC right kind of it's kind of a cross product but it's the cartoon. It's kind of a Cartesian product, but it's actually your your union in them together right, but you can  it's a good way to think about it.  Yes.  yasso in here  write this is for every subset of C rank. The empty set is a subset of C. Right. So I'm including Xscape plus one Union the empty set which is just the set Xscape plus one.  And here no because I'm Union in every subset of C with Xscape plus one.  Right. So the empty set Union x k + 1 is x k + 1  Any other questions?  I'm going to show you a question.  Schodack the other  There's got to be to show let me just write.  Yeah, if you want you can write a little if you want to be clear. You can write a little bubble here that says something like  this set has  the same  number  elements  has power service e  it's clear. I mean you can you can write a whole paragraph of why but the reason is because your your set is going over all subsets of c and it's adding one one new one for each for each set.  Good question though. It's kind of a a challenge for all of us to know how much to write but that's going to be something we will have to work on this whole this whole Court.  Okay, let's just look quickly at this example that we showed here. I want to kind of give you a sense of how this construction works. So.  Let's suppose that ABC was my set a right.  From the proof then I'm going to break it up into the set see that we have with the last element so break it up into a, b Union C.  Then this top row.  Is the power set of a bee?  right  bet that was kind of like RC sat in the other proof and then noticed that this bottom row is everything from the top rope with a c added on to it.  And so that's why they have the same amount of elements. And so this might this might help with understanding why those two sets have both have to Decay elements.  Okay good.  so  next up is what I want to do is I want to relax this.  This statement so from from when we started induction up to now everything has always started with 0, right we're showing that this statement is true for all non-negative integers.  Okay induction, we can actually start at any number. Okay. So if you have a statement that's different that says show that some statement P of K is true for all integers K greater than or equal to sum integer be.  Okay, so before be was just equal to zero and we were happy with that. But now let's extend it so that it can maybe be can start at 1 or Beacon start at 2 and so on.  Okay.  So this is how you set up the proof show that it's true for be this is our new basis step.  And then use that to show for everything greater than be. Okay. So then you have to say something like assume K is greater than equal to be then assumed are inductive hypothesis, which is still the same thing right still PRK and use that to to prepare kale.  Okay. Okay good.  Let's look at this one.  We still have some time. So I'm going to give you guys a few minutes. You can work with your neighbor see if you can write out the mathematical induction proof to prove this statement.  I guess before we do that we should figure out where it starts right this actually, it does not start at zero necessarily does it?  you guys know a factorial is  What's right out a few a few numbers?  N squared in factorial  Okay, so zero we have zero and what's 0 factorial?  Good.  Okay, what about one one and one?  2  4 + 2  3  9 + 6 dang is the m squared always going to be bigger.  Now, what's the next one?  41624 5:25  120 and actually at this point the factorial is going to take over forever and this is not enough to show that but we can do it inductive lie, so  So did so factorial is bigger than than M squared at what point when n is greater than or equal to what?  4K search for all of these things, okay.  For all and greater than equal to 4.  Thanks of give it a shot use this new.  Proof structure that I showed you in the previous slide want me to go back.  I'll give you guys a few minutes and then we can we can kind of finish it up together.  Let me know if you want to see the original statement again.  I guess I could just write it in the corner.  We're trying to show and squared is strictly less than in factorial for all and greater than or equal to 4.  So in this case for is be  I don't forget your bases step. We actually already showed it, but you still need to kind of write it.  and then  noticed that when you starting to write your inductive step you have to say something like assume that K is greater than or equal to what number  for now and then use that  and if you raise your hand if you're having trouble with what factorial means and we can talk about it.  I'm going to get myself a new slide so we can ride out this proof together.  Either some of the exercises you guys can do.  On your own if you like.  Let's do this proof together. What it what was what's right or statement first, which is what and squared is greater than or less than and factorial for all in greater than or equal to 4. Okay good proof by induction.  good basis.  4 squared is less than 4 factorial.  my inspection  or if you like you could say because 16 is less than 24 done.  Okay inductive step.  Now we say let K be an integer.  With K greater than or equal to 4 and that's where we start.  now assume our inductive hypothesis assume  what?  Assume that K squared is less than K factorial.  What do we want to show?  So now we just pick one of the sides of the inequality and try to get to the other side. What do you guys want to start with? You want to start with k + 1 squared or do you want to start with k + 1 factorial?  Quepos 1 factorial. Okay. So you were going to try to prove equivalently k + 1 factorial is greater than k + 1 squared you want to do it that way. Let's do it.  The start with k + 1 factorial now just like when we were doing the sets we want to kind of decompose k + 1 factorial in terms of just pay factorial. How do you do that?  It's K factorial * k + 1.  Okay. Now how do we incorporate the inductive hypothesis here?  Okay good. You know that K factorial is bigger than K Factor was bigger than K Square. So that means this thing is bigger than what  K squared * k + 1  Now what?  Yeah, how we going to do that?  Michael typing equals 1  Now that's not going to show that k + 1 factorial is greater than k + 1 squared.  Good good. This is the this is the observation.  Never write it in a little box over here.  Let's do it this way.  K squared is always going to be bigger than k + 1 y because we already assumed that K is greater than equal to 4.  Sobriquet is greater than equal to 4. This is true.  Maybe this requires another.  Argument, but let's just take it to be true. This is true for all K greater than equal to 4.  so this is greater than  k + 1 * k + 1  at this so you can sorta see maybe why this proof would break down if we started at 0 because 0 squared is not bigger than 0 plus one and we kind of had to get big enough in order to use that helper.  statement  Okay. Well, I guess that's all the time we have for today question. "
