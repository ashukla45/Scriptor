    "Full Transcript": "Good morning, everyone.  So what's up?  It started here.  So yeah question.  I'm sorry.  What do you want to know?  I'm sorry.  Been finalized yet.  It's going to be on Monday.  We'll do a little bit review today to start some of you and then we'll do a little bit more on Friday.  question  Yeah, we're going to post that today.  And then we'll go over maybe a few select problems on Friday and class from the practice midterm and then we'll post a Solutions this weekend. So you guys can use that to help study.  Yes. Yes, sir.  Okay.  So let's not do a little bit more things with sex. I wanted to revisit this this definition because  there is a notation a standard notation that we're going to use in this class that I want everybody to be familiar with Okay, so  When you see this symbol here.  This means subset. Okay, and this is the definition.  And I guess sort of the form of this symbol you can kind of think about it as like a less than or equal to write. That's why that line is underneath because you can be kind of a proper subset or equal to the set right this for all accessing a implies x + B. This is consistent if the sets are equal.  So if you want to talk about something that is a proper subset.  Oh, sorry. Let's do this first so $0.04 and b equals B. If and only if both of these are true a is a subset of B&B is a subset and we already looked at kind of a proof of this we're going to do a few more proofs of this type. So you guys get the hang of it.  Okay.  let me see if that I get a  that let me just write it here.  proper subset  Okay, so a is a subset a proper subset of B. This is the notation we're going to use. Okay, so it's a subset but it's not equal so means  for all Acts  Well, let's just write it like this. It means that a is a subset of B.  and right  a is not equal to B.  By the way, you can write it is for all X XNA implies X in b  and case you have that statement and there exists a y and B such that.  why is not in a  has I got another element in be that's not in a so, these are two different statements me.  Or means this thing.  Okay, so you might see this symbol here.  never use  this  Will never use it you never use it everybody clear on that.  So what does it mean?  It actually in my bucket me proper subset, but some people take it to mean just regular subset. So because it's ambiguous we're not going to use it at all. And so these these two  notations that we have above those ones are without ambiguity. So those are the ones we're going to use some K questions.  Okay.  Okay, so I know we already did this but I wanted to revisit this question because I know that the empty set can be a little tricky.  Which of the following is not true?  The empty set is a subset of the empty set. The empty set is an element of the empty set for any set a empty set is a subset of a foursome set be empty set is an element of b or more than one of the above.  What do you guys say?  Okay, one of these.  Which which ones which ones are?  Are you picking which two?  B&D  okay, so be it is certainly not true.  The empty sack cannot be an element of the empty set because the empty set has no elements.  but  this one is true actually.  Let B be the set containing the empty set.  Right. Now you have a set where the empty set is an element. So this kind of opens up the door two sets where their elements are actually sets. We talked about this already when we talked about the power set any questions.  Bee is the correct answer.  Okay, let's just read to find these set operations intersection Union set difference and Cartesian product.  And I'll do an example of Cartesian product. We didn't really get a good one last time. So so here are how they are defined. So intersection goes with and Union goes with or a minus B.  This is also an and statement we can we can we can redefine it in a different way if you like a little bit later.  And A cross B. Okay. So let's do it. Let's do a Cartesian product. Okay. So if my first set is one, two  Cross my second set maybe is one,  a, b  and the Cartesian product is going to have all of the combinations of elements where the first or all the ordered pairs of elements were. The first entry of the ordered pair is from the first set of second entry is from the second set. So, what would it look like 1:1?  the set containing 1 1  1A  1p  2 1  2A  to be  are there any questions about that?  Okay good.  Alright set complement so we already talked about this too. I just wanted to reiterate it so often they will be this Universal set that will call you that is considered to be the set of everything for particular situation right? Thanks for the complement of a set a a compliment is going to be the universe - A so everything in the universe that's not in a  Okay, let's look at a few of these examples.  Okay. So what is a union B?  Well, how would I draw that in this Venn diagram?  You basically just color and everything, right?  Is the set of all elements such that the federal element X such that X is in a or x's and be so that's all.  Okay. How about a intersect B?  It's just the football, right?  Pink eye.  Okay. How about a minus B?  It's just like the the Crescent right?  Everything that's in a but does not envy.  Okay, how about a compliment?  Yeah, so like let's say that our universe has the square now.  then a complement is everything outside of a  So it's really nice to have these Venn diagrams and these are good tools to use if you're trying to work things out in your head and make sure that the statement that you're trying to prove is actually true. These are good tools to use questions about this.  Okay good.  Alright, so because we have the set operations Union and intersection and they're based on Ann's an ORS we can talk about some demorgan's laws for the sets.  and  it might be useful to do so we're going to do an like a formal proof, but it might be useful to do at the pictorial proof also.  so  let's look at this first one.  Okay.  Actually now let's look at the second one. Let's look at this one.  Okay, so I have  why is it keep on doing that? Okay, so I have a union B complement.  That's everything outside of A and B will say this is a and this is B.  All right. So now I want to intersect a complement and B complement.  a compliment  Looks like this.  and B complement  looks like this.  So a complement intersect B complement.  What's everything it's all it's all the set of all X that's in a compliment and in be compliment, right? And so it's just all the things that are outside of a and b.  Print shop. It's nice to try to do the pectoral thing first and give you a sense of why they're true.  All right, cuz so let's actually do the formal proof. This is going to be kind of how you do these proofs in your homework and and and and so forth.  Okay. So how do you prove two sets are equal do you need to prove? That one is a subset of the other and the other way around. Okay, so that kind of brings us into how do you show one set is a subset of another set?  And this is how you do it. You say suppose a is in s you do some logic logical steps and then you use that to show that  So let's get started on this proof. I'm just going to prove One Direction for right now. Okay?  So I put this Arrow here. So what I'm trying to prove right now is that a intersect B complement is a subset of a complement Union B complement. This is my goal of improving trying to get to there. Okay suppose X is in a intersect B complement and this is just an arbitrary acts, right?  And so this hopefully whatever whenever I'm done, this will be true for every x no matter what I say, so we'll say x's in a intersect B complement.  Okay, so what does that mean?  Well, let's break down. What a intersect B complement means and let me actually write this over here.  Goal is to show that a intersect B complement is a subset of a complement Union B complement.  Okay, good. Okay. So the first step is now that we have that we have that X is.  An element of you minus a intersect B.  That's what it means to be compliment. Okay. Now let's translate. What does it mean to be in a set difference?  Ex is in Polish. Go back for a sec. What is that difference set differences here? It's the set of all X such that X is in a and X is not in be okay.  x's in  the set of all and maybe I should use a different variable hear the set of all y such that.  Why is in the universe and why is not in a intersect B?  Okay, good. So let some.  Let's kind of.  Take this apart.  Sup ex is in.  Come on. Now the set of Y such that Y is in you and it's not the case that why is in a intersect B, right? That's just what not means.  Not in so X is in why such that Y is it in you and okay. It's not the case that why isn't a intersect B.  actually  let me  shut up. Let me start over. Sorry I messed up.  I didn't mess up but I think there's a better way that for me to do this.  Okay.  Sorry, okay, so Exes in you.  And X is not in a intersect B. It's a little bit easier to say it this way right instead of saying it's in that big set. This is just what it means for it to be you minus 80% be sorry about that. Okay, so this means X is in you.  and it's not the case that X is in a intersect b a good this means that X is in you and it's not the case that  X is in a and X is envy  cuz that's what it means to be in a intersect B.  Okay good.  Okay, so now let's use them demorgan's law because now we just have a and statement and we can use it directly.  And so this will be not XNA.  Or not X and B.  okay, so this is X you and  X not in a  I guess I should do it like this.  Not in a or X not in be. Okay good. So at this point  I don't know if you guys remember this rule, but it was one of those like 32 rules that we saw in the book. It's sort of like a distributive property of hands indoors. Okay, so we're ending and or so that means that it's it's the first statement and the and each  statement in the OR  and so what do I mean by that it just turns into?  X is in you and X is not in a  or X is in you and X is not in b.  You guys remember that rule?  Okay, but this is just if x's and you and X is not in a that means the exit you minus a  Thanks, we get this but you might as a is just a compliment is in a compliment or X isn't be compliment. So that just means ex is in a complement Union B complement.  Okay, any questions about that?  This is just one direction. Maybe you guys can try to do the other direction as an exercise. It's going to look almost exactly like just going backwards, but maybe try to do it on your own without looking.  Which statement?  Yeah, x's and a compliment or x's and B complement. Yeah, so it could just be in a compliment or it could just be empty, but this is the union of them both.  not in  that's the definition of set difference.  A-minus B. So in our case you was A and B was a intersect B.  electric line for the last time  Give me this line here.  And what was the question?  There are there parentheses so you do whatever in the parentheses.  If what?  Nexus portal gusd, that's what you're trying to say. But are we going to be you minus me first and then safe and be part of Acts Texas going to be part of it.  Yeah.  YouTube DIY you do the setup eration first  What does WhatsApp does the University?  Good question.  This is actually true for any universe that you pick that contains both A and B.  universe  The first thing and say that God of the universe.  So the first line is typed, right? It just says suppose that X is in a intersect B complement.  now the definition of compliment  write the definition of a compliment for example is just you minus a right so that next line is just definition of compliment.  Okay, let's look at another example. So let's do exercise.  Do the other direction?  which means to show  that a a complement Union B complement is also a subset of a intersect B complement.  Guess you guys can do that on your own.  Okay. Oh, I have it all the way this way.  Great.  Okay, so this is the same thing. Okay, let's do another set equality proof.  okay, so the set to a such that a zinzi intersect the set 3 B such that b is in Z is equal to the set cc6 C such that C is in z  song  what do I need to do?  to show set equality  What's kind of like the overall strategy?  Write show. Each subset. Each one is a subset of the other. Let's call this set a and set B, I need to show.  A is a subset of B and B is a subset of a so, let's start with a is a subset of B.  So what is the first line of showing a subset proof?  suppose  ex is in a you always start it like that and then a lot of the times these proofs just kind of write themselves in a way if you can follow the definitions then they'll  If you're doing them correctly and if it's true, you'll get to the conclusion.  So suppose accident at that means that X is in this set.  to a such that is in z  intersect  3 B such that b is in Z. Okay good.  So what does intersection mean and or or  And right so let's write that out.  Okay, so then.  X is in the set to a set that is a visit and deter.  and  and X is in the stat3 B such that b is an integer.  Okay. So now we have to kind of get into the into the math right? We're start off in the sets. We're going to go into the math and they were going to come back out into the sets.  The set to a such that a is in Z. What does that mean is there is can anybody translate that translate this?  this statement here into some sort of  proposition or like maybe a  A with a quantifier maybe in a predicate or something like that.  Okay, good X is an even number? What does it mean to be even?  8 divisible by 2  Okay, we could say that to.  yeah, let's do it with the  Yeah.  Let's do it like with the existence of existential quantifier. So this means there exists some a such that.  X is equal to 2 a  and there exists some be such that X is equal to 3 B, right we have these two things.  Okay now.  We can keep these right there exists an A and B such that.  X is equal to 2 a which is equal to 3 B.  Well, the universe is sort of implicit because we're talking about it here.  stop  It's not super.  I mean a lot of the times you'll see in certain proofs. You just kind of if it's clear what it is. You don't have to write it all the time.  So what does this mean is that we have X?  is  a multiple of 2 and it's a multiple of 3 and so  Let's do it like this.  There exists a a and b such that X over 2 is equal to a and X over 3 is equal to be frank.  2x / 2 is a integer an X over 3 is also an integer is this enough to show that x / 6 is an integer?  Is there something that we have to kind of notice about 2 and 3?  Their Prime, right?  so  wow.  What's a good way to do this?  What's up?  Okay.  So * x / 2 equals 8 by 6.  So we get 3 x is equal to 6 a  and 2x is equal to 6 B like that.  How do you get a chance of being with x over 6 in Pinson Valley?  Wright-Patt OBX squared / 6  All right, maybe if you go that route, let me just kind of.  Give you a give you a way to think about this.  X over 2 is equal to  let's do it this way.  2 a is equal to 3 be right. So that means a is equal to 3 be over to right now. He is an integer. So 3B / 2 is an integer 3 does not divide 2.  and B does not divide 2 or suspect know that means that be device to thank so since  3  let's say it like this since two and three are relatively prime.  this means  that  Is divisible by 2?  so  what can we what can we get from that?  well  What do we have exes?  rebe  axis equal to  the best way to go about that  best physical by 2  also be okay. Here we go. Here we go. So this means that there exists.  Some let's call it D from integer D such that.  Is equal to 2 D?  Now X is equal to 3 which is equal to 3 x 2D which is equal to 6 d k. So there exists some and Z such that.  X is equal to 6 D. This means that X is in the set of all, what was it?  6 C such that C is in z  so the reason I had to do kind of this relatively prime thing is because  If you tried to do the same problem, but the numbers weren't relatively prime. You wouldn't get the same result.  Okay questions.  Oh well until we Prime.  A & B are relatively.  Prime if their greatest common divisor is equal to 1  so they have no common factors bigger than 1  absolutely. What does that mean?  My name is not just relatively prime is also absolutely try and then they trying.  Oh, so Prime is a description that you can give to a single number relatively prime. You have to have two numbers.  They have to be like relative to each other their Prime.  for this part  Well, the only reason we can say that b is divisible by 2 is because 2 and 3 are relatively prime.  there's a theorem in number Theory where if  do you have something like this where you have a product on the top of it in the numerator and the number in the denominator, if the if the number in the denominator is relatively prime to one of the factors in the numerator, then it must be a divisor of the other one granted that the whole fraction is a integer.  You guys done any of that kind of number Theory stuff?  in high school  Okay, maybe we'll put it in.  the curriculum  It's good to know. What's up with this is B. Theorem I'm saying is that if let's say let's use some different things here if x y / Z is equal to n if it's an integer, right?  and gcd of x and z  is equal to 1  this means that Z divides why?  This is the theorem that I'm using to prove it.  Sorry if it was confusing.  Bacterial infection treated with entry at home access Facebook you back. Okay, can we say that?  2 is a factor.  Of x + 3 is a factor.  Of X so6 is a factor.  Acts so this is actually valid but it's only because two and three are relatively prime. Let me give you a different example instead of two. Let's replace it with or instead of three. Let's replace it with four.  Okay now to is a factor of x + 4 is a factor of X does that mean that 8 is a factor of x?  Not necessarily so it really is.  Important that they're relatively prime. Okay, let's do the other direction would be a little bit easier.  Okay, we want to show that.  The set of all six C such that c is an integer.  is a subset of  the set of all to a such that a is an integer.  intersect 3B such that  such that b is an integer.  suppose  What do we call this was Bea and this was this whole set was a right. They suppose X is in b  that means  that there exists some see such that X is equal to 6 C.  Okay, right, so  This is also equal to 2 * 3 * C.  so  3 C is an integer.  So there exist.  And a such that X is equal to a either exists an integer a such that X is equal to 2 a because of receipt is an integer.  And to see is an integer.  So there exists a b such that X is equal to 3 V right so we have both of those things.  Put a big and here.  therefore  X is in  to a such that a is in  z  And X is in 3B such that b is in z.  so  Exes in this direction was a little bit easier day. It'll be easier to show that this multiples of 6 is a subset of this intersection.  questions about that direction  Okay.  Okay, a few more definitions disjoint sets two sets are disjoint if their intersection is empty. They how does that look in a Venn diagram? It just kind of means that they don't have any elements in common.  How do you write it you write it like this a intersect B is equal to the empty set. If you have that that just means they're disjoint.  Some other notation that we can use is this big Union sign in this big intersection sign. So remember how we kind of strung together a bunch of fans and strung together a bunch of ores, but we can do it the same with unions and intersections.  Text Sigma notation exactly.  Okay.  Jah Cure Sigma notation  right  It's just summing up all of the terms. Okay, so you start with i is equal to 1 up to n?  And you have this ASA by that means you start with Ace of one you add a sub to a taste of 3 and you increment I buy one every time until you get up to end. It actually doesn't really matter what variable you use down here as long as it matches with what you have here.  shop  How would you write an expression for the sum of the first n positive integers? Well, you do something like this.  Because you just replace I with each one of those numbers in the sequence. Okay, so it's going to be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 all the way up.  Okay, you guys can do these other exercises on your own.  Okay good. So we just have a few more minutes. I wanted to give you a sense of what's going to be on the exam.  Okay, so  it's on Monday. It covers everything that we've done through today and  Please come to the section that you were enrolled in. So if you enrolled in my class, please come here. If you're enrolled in Ben's class, please go there.  And Friday we're going to do a review in class. It's going to be mainly well. We're going to do kind of a general review and then we're also going to do a few problems from the practice exam that will post today. Okay?  Denverpost the solution to the practice exam this weekend. So you'll have a chance to check your work, but we want you to at least try the problems first before you look at the solutions just so that you're you're learning on your own and not depending on our  Instruction one more thing, please bring a pencil or a pen a photo ID and you can have one page optional if you want a handwritten. Okay one side of one page.  How do you prepare?  The practice midterm review the home works and and also the solutions homework solutions.  Okay, do extra practice problems in the book. We've posted a bunch of extra practice problems in the extra resources and extra reading to do and creating the page of notes is actually a good way to study cuz you figure out what you know, what you don't know what you might need to know and often times after people make the the sheet of notes. They bring it to the test. They don't even look at it. And why is that because the process of making the notes sheet is helpful for remembering some of the things.  Okay. See you guys on Friday. "
