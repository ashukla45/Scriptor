Okay, so  we have one-on-one sessions that you guys can sign up for its the  Top pin thing in Piazza, or you can find it in Piazza and then there's a link to a Google Drive spreadsheet in there.  Our tirezan tutors have shown you their availabilities so you can sign up and meet with one of them for 30 minutes. And the the intent for these one-on-one sessions is mainly for people to be able to catch up. It's it's challenging if you're far behind to be able to catch up just solely in office hours or just coming to lecture. So if there's something that you kind of miss that you wanted to refresh or if you're just really confused about a certain topic than these are really good really good resource alternatively. You could also talk about the homework that you just turned in or what we went over in lecture today.  And things like that, what we don't want you to do is use these one-on-one sessions to talk about the homework that's going to be do those those types of questions. We want you to bring to office hours because likely a lot of other students will have the similar questions so we can kind of all talk about them at once. Okay, I encourage you to sign up today if you if you want some help if you want some extra help or if you want to just try it out and see what it is we have to offer.  Okay questions.  All right.  Let's get started. Okay. So today we're going to talk about what it means to be consistent. So that's what one thing.  I don't know if I like this thing here.  What needs to be consistent then we're going to look at equivalences and prove that certain propositions are equivalent using truth tables, but also using a a set of well-known equivalences.  and  there are a bunch of them in your book that you guys can use will go over a few of them today. And then if we get to it will start talking about how to  How to construct propositions from truth tables and what does it mean for a set of connect connective propositional connectives to be complete to be able to describe any possible truth table?  Okay. So before we get started today, I wanted to go over this.  disconnected  this one we've already talked about the truth table and that's how it's defined right? It's Define to b p q  true true  true false false true false false  It's Define to be true false true true. And I know I had some conversations with some people of on Friday or last week about how does it how do I make sense of this? Well, I'd say start with the the  Truth table definition and see if you can make sense of it in all these things. So all of these phrases  Translate  to P implies q and  Let's just go through them because some of them q and P kind of coming to you the opposite order. So just be careful because what's going to happen is you're going to read a sentence and it's going to have one of these phrases and you need to be able to translate that into the mathematical logic notation. Okay. So we have p.m. Plies Q if P then Q, these are kind of the norm once noticed that Q if P has it the opposite direction. Basically what you're saying is if P then q but you're just saying it in the in the reverse way.  P only if Q so this one  It's kind of saying.  If Q is not true, then p is not true.  Does anybody recognize that?  Right you guys remember what the name is?  Contrapositive right saw this contrapositive is logically equivalent to P implies Q, so I'm going to put it up there as one of the faces. Okay Q whenever P or Q when P something like that.  Q is necessary for p  That means P implies q and then we have p is sufficient for Q. That means P implies Q like the p is enough to show the Q kind of the idea now.  Even I get tripped up on these things. So it's kind of nice to just have them as a list and be able to use this as a resource. Okay, so don't don't feel bad if  You can't just go from one to the other immediately. It's you know, it's kind of confusing so.  Take that. Okay any questions about this?  naked  Okay, so let's talk about what it means to be consistent. So if I had some system specification write a sequence of statements, what I want to know is is it even possible that they could all happen right or that there is a situation where they could all be true. Okay. So this read the router can send packets to the edge system only if it supports the new address space for the router to support the new address pays it is necessary that the latest software release be installed Etc. Right, so maybe I find out that my router.  Cannot send packets, right? What kind of other things can I infer from that right if I have this list of things so these are the types of questions. We're going to think about  Okay, so I guess more succinctly we could say can such a system be built. Can there be can these propositions be kind of configured in such a way to be true and false and and what have you so that each one of these sentences is true.  Another words, let's let's look at this right here. In other words. The specifications are consistent. If there is a truth assignment to the input propositional variables that made specification true. We'll see how that looks in the truth table but in a minute, yeah, so let's some  let's look at how we kind of break this down.  Okay, so I'm giving you a bunch of sentences and each one of them is a statement, right? So  How do we determine if it's consistent?  So you start with the system specifications in English.  You assign each one of the parts of each sentence to a propositional variable and you turn the sentence into a logical into logical notation logic notation.  Been feeling the truth tables for each one of the propositions each one of the sentences that are translated.  And look for a row where each of the output columns evaluates to true.  Okay, so let's let's do an example.  Okay. So what I like to do is just look through it and whenever I find a sentence like a part I'll assign a variable to it. Okay, so the router can send packets to the edge system.  You can kind of see that only if is not really part of that.  Proposition right only if is more like a helper word or you can translate only if into a logic notation.  So let's call this first proposition.  And then another color I guess.  It only supports the new address space. This is something different. So let's call that Q.  So for the router to support the new address space, what is this?  This is still cureight.  Still got that that proposition.  It is necessary that right. This isn't part of the proposition. This is going to be helping us translated into notation use another.  Color the latest software release must be installed. So this is something different. Let's call that are  tank. So the router can send packages to the end system. That's pee again.  rent  Let's see here. We got it if  And then we have are the latest software release is installed.  AR  And this last one the router?  Let me just do it like this.  The router supports the new address space but does not is going to be kind of like translated into the notation.  Cute, but this is q.  What is the weather these translations?  P only if Q right  2  let's say for queue. It is necessary.  That are right pfr and not Q.  any questions  good question is are implying if it pn flies are or is it are implied p  Or implies p and if you're still trying to figure that out, just go back to our list here.  topian place to means Q if p  Okay, good. Good question.  Lights out these are these are my statements.  Now I have to see if they are consistent with each other if they're all consistent, which means that there's an assign a truth assignment to p q and R such that all of these statements are true.  Okay, so let's translate them P only if Q right? Well, that's not Q implies not-p, which is just peeing pies que if you like.  4 q it is necessary that are  Anybody know what this one is?  is actually Q implies r  Right. Let's go back to our cheat sheet.  Q is necessary for p right we're saying that  Sear  Q is necessary for P. That means P implies Q, right?  So cute is the thing. That's necessary here. I guess it's just kind of stated sort of weird, right? It is necessary that are so are is the thing that's necessary in order to choke you. Sometimes it takes a little bit of rearrangement to to show these things.  Okay, so that's or implies Q.  No, that's to apologize to me hear a pfr that's are implied p and not Q of course. It's just not cute.  So can such a system be built. Well, what we can do is write each one of these in the truth table and and see if there is a a row that are all true.  Okay.  so  yes.  So it's just kind of the way you say it, right? It is necessary that are  like saying that are is true.  It's necessary that you said Q is true.  For you to determine that are s true it's necessary for you to be true.  I guess it's a better. If you do it this way not our implies not Q, right if R is false. That means Q has to be false.  4 q to be true are should be true.  right if you have q then you have our  Q implies r  If I was not true, then that's been I think he was not true.  so confusing  sorry, sorry if I'm confusing you more but  That's why I gave you the cheat sheet so you can you can all have a place to look.  All right.  So let's go to the truth table. So I already filled it out for you. You guys can fill it out as exercise if you want, but  Tree guys have had practice with this but it would be good practice to do this again. Okay, so these are my four statements.  What I want to know is are they consistent? Is there a row that makes them all true?  So I guess it's only the last one, huh?  Okay. So this this set of the system specification is consistent. Okay, so it's consistent if they do not contain conflicting requirements. It is consistent. And so sometimes you'll see that there are more than one row that are all true in this particular case it so there's only one row if there's only one row then you can kind of forced everything else.  If you know the if you know the truth value.  Of one of them.  any questions  All right. So let's go into some tools that we can use. These are all on your book these useful equivalences. These will help us kind of  Show that two propositions are equivalent. They're also useful in.  simplifying them  So let's go through a few of these. There's there's a bunch of other ones in the book also, but let's go through these ones first.  Okay. This one's called demorgan's law.  And has two parts, okay.  basically what it says is that  you can change and then doors into each other by using this negation.  innocence  Okay, so if p and Q.  Is true, right?  Say like this.  Or I guess let's say it this way for this one if p and Q is false. Then that means either pee is false or Q is false.  kind of the idea  and I also work this way.  If P or Q is false.  Then either P. Then p is false and Q is false.  Maybe take a moment to  to absorb that try to maybe make it make it make sense. I mean if you if you put it into the truth tables, it'll all come out, but it's nice to kind I try to link it to how you interpret it.  So this is just commutativity.  It doesn't matter the order. We already kind of talked about this or is in Anne's are commutative. So it doesn't matter the order that you put them in.  It turns out that implication and Plies. It does matter the order but for these ones it doesn't.  Okay, so these are kind of like identity properties of f&t. So and as always at fault is always no matter what he is. So this is just kind of a  Tell me you can use or true is always true.  And then kind of kind of along those same lines p and true is always just pee right. It's just kind of decides what p is and P or false. True or false is true if PS Falls people.  Answer this one is also very useful. It comes up a lot. It's because this implication is is not in terms of Ann's indoors and not ever going to see that using indoors and knots is really helpful in in first of all sort of normalizing how to write out a proposition, but also think about it in circuits. How do you make an implication circuit?  When are only the only circuit connections that we have our oars and and nuts and so this is how you make a implication circuit you you translate it into not P or Q.  Okay, and then just last one that we have up here is contrapositive. We already talked about this.  So another useful thing about these is that we can simplify it or maybe only maybe try to only use  A small portion of the connectors that we have right do we actually need them all do we actually need implication do we actually need and we actually need not ready when I say do we need I'm talking about. Is it possible to create every single possible truth table?  With only a small collection of these connectives.  Okay, so also we talked about this is all so it's it's very useful when you want to simplify. So if you have this really big long proposition with implications and hands and not saint doors and stuff you might be able to simplify into a smaller.  For a I guess a string with fewer characters.  Okay.  So another reason that we have these are for  Proof of statements basically, we start off with a few propositions and we use these equivalences to logically step-by-step deduce another one of the equivalences and then we'll see how that works too. We might not get to that today, but we're going to see kind of how  how to make a logical argument using these equivalences  Okay good.  Okay. So let's do a sample equivalence proof. What I want to do is show that  P and Q implies R is logically equivalent to P implies Q implies r  One way to do. This is to write out the truth tables and look at the  Each row and make sure all the rows match, right we talked about this as being one way to show logical equivalence. Another way to show it is to use these well-known equivalences that you can find in your book. All right, so  Let's do it.  So what I'm going to do is basically break this down into and ores and not and see if the other one breaks down to the same thing. I'm trying to get rid of the implication. Does anybody remember how to turn the implication into a proposition with oars and knots?  Okay good. So this is logically equivalent to not pnq.  or are  I just got that from the list. But if you are still wondering where it comes from, you can actually write out the truth table and see that they're logically equivalent.  Okay, so now I have a not applied to an or as soon as I'm not tied to it. And how do I  How do I make sense of this part here?  Okay, good. Not P or not Q.  or are  so there's another Aldi's equivalent says there's another one that I didn't show you but it's the it's the property of Association. So ordinands are both associative, which means that if you have a string of oars  That it doesn't matter in which order you combine them? Okay, and so often times we just write it like this.  Alright, let's do this one. Alright, so first I'm going to look at this implication. How do I translate that into a knot in or  Not P or the quantity Q implies are right.  Okay, how do I take care of?  this one  not P or and then in here I have not qu  or are  now you don't have to name the equivalence.  It might be nice. If if if you're trying to show it to somebody where you got each one from but  grass to draw t-shirt. Is it okay to put like arbitrary amount of inputs into the end in divorce or do we have to work in Cascade like that? Like the output of one and gave him?  You can so you can have multiple.  What do you call and wires coming from the same input?  What you mean?  Oh, I see what you mean to input them. I see what you mean.  I see what you mean. Yeah, so you could draw this as you have p q and r  p&q get inverted, right?  Are stays like that?  And then you have your or like that, right? Yeah, that's fine. You can do it that way or you could Cascade them.  It's a sort of another.  consequence of it having this associative property  I suppose so.  You kind of go from one to another and use like a sequence of them to to to simplify a complicated expression.  current  Okay. I got a question for you guys. Let me do my frequency is a b any compound proposition can be translated to one proposition.  Using what only Ann's can I make every single truth table using only Anne's using only or is using only implies or using only not or none of the above. Is it not possible to?  To use only one of these connectives in order to create every single proposition.  My bad. I know you can't say if you are some key indicators, not you got into Harvard.  Yes.  Yes, just the variables that are given.  Okay, so  most people say none of the above and  I want to stay here.  Anybody want to make a comment?  man  Wait, are you saying and nand?  Okay.  That's true, but that's not one of the things and we can talk about that and it'll sort of follow from what our next our next little lesson will be those of you who are wondering what man is it's just the the connection not and rent.  So anybody else want to make a comment?  You by definition need to use a lot for the Morgan Spas Wichita violates the fact that you're  Okay. Yeah, so it's  it's so it seems like you need if you have it and you also need a not right. Did you have a comment?  I guess you just connected to it through and I'm very willing.  Yeah, so if that was like your question that can we introduce these some.  these are other variables with not end with false in troops, but  Just the variables we're not able to do. Okay. So none of the above. We're not able to do it with any of those. Okay. So what are we able to do it with?  That's kind of the next thing.  this this this question the answer this question is or the the statement of this question is  What collection of connectives are functionally complete in or what collection of operations are functionally complete?  Okay, so  my claim is that the connective and and not together are functionally complete which means that any proposition you give me any compound proposition you give me I can translate it into just a proposition with Ann's and nuts.  Okay, so let's look at this example.  This is a pretty easy one, right?  Because it's just uses Anne's and not already so and remember that.  Okay, so if I can do this then all the circuits that I need are an inverter and the answer can so, how do I turn this into a circuit?  Isn't this just the one we just looked at on this one is kind of the opposite. Okay, so are gets inverted.  and we have and  and if you like you could do it this way too because in your  I could your physical circuit you may not have this ability to put them all in so you might be able to do you might want to do something like this instead.  but that's supposed to be in our  and this is kind of what you were saying Okay. So let's look at it another one peor que or is not allowed or not.  and ants  Okay, so now I should introduce another equivalence that we didn't really talk about yet, but is important.  The double negative, right?  so this is equivalent to  the double- of P or Q  Not not true.  Cuz of her that before, okay, so then what we can do is take this portion here.  And use de Morgan's law to translate it to not.  not-p  And not cute.  Any questions about that?  How do we translate this into a circuit p and Q let's invert each one.  Put it into our and gate.  And then invert the result.  any questions  All right good.  How about this one? How about implication?  Now I know how to turn it into a knot in a or can you turn it into and you guys are going to give you guys just a few minutes talk it over with your neighbor see if you can do it and then draw the circuit.  Sounds good.  This is going to be.  according to Legend the logical equivalent  I said to equal.  Now you can't do that if you mix the ants indoors that's not allowed anymore.  If you mix the ants indoors in the order really does matter, but if it's just all one thing you can.  Kind of like you can't mix multiplying in an ad.  Adventure  they could draw two logically equivalent one.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Okay, how's it going?  Hope you guys all got this first step.  Yeah.  Then what did you do?  double negative  so then use demorgan's law which is when we keep that one out there and we have inside here. We have a not not p and not Q.  But then we have another double- that we can just cancel, right.  s o p and Q  Q gets inverted  and and then the result gets in first.  Did you guys all have this?  any questions  All right.  How about this one?  This one. Let's skip the drawing of the circuit for this one.  but think about it, maybe you could do it as an exercise at home, but I just want you to get the  the proposition  so  If you're if you're if you're struggling on where to start remember that this biconditional what does it mean it means if and only if so, it's both implication. It's p implies q and Q implies p  Hey, so that should be your first step.  and if your  if you have a  short-term memory  you could just translate those implications from what we did before right?  So just jump back to that slide. What was it is this thing? So, let's just put that in.  Not pee not p and not Q so this will be not.  p and not q and  not  q and not pee  not can I get rid of the parentheses here because of the associative associative Ade?  No, right because they're kind of locked because of its I'm adding the not there. So you can't do the associative property here because we could have been  that would be any questions.  Okay, last one.  P exclusive or  Q  If you're having trouble with where to start just raise your hand and we can kind of come help.  Exclusive or so. That means that  P or q but not both peor is true but not both of them.  queso if you  You might you might notice something about exclusive or does it have any connection with the biconditional?  It's the negation of it, right so we can just do that, right?  And then we can just use what we did before.  Right, which was this thing? Can I copy paste here now?  All right. Well  What would it be? Not p and not Q not piano. Q?  and not  q and not pee  Okay. Can I do anything to that too? Kind of like simplify it?  But distribute what the knot.  but then that would think that would introduce her or  yeah, maybe you could you get it back into like a simpler form with Ann's.  I called that to court. That's it for now. Okay. So here's kind of like a guy for doing this kind of thing. You know, we might ask you to do this.  So work from the inside out right for each connected replace it with the equivalent form that uses only not an end if it's not in and do nothing if it's or use a double negative thing that we just did if it's implies just use this thing. We we got it. We've already sort of proved it.  and if it's if and only if replace it with what we did and if it's  exclusive or replace it with the negation event.  We can now use these freely since we've all proven them.  Okay, so  let's let's do this one together, but we're going to use my guide here. So let's work from the inside out.  So a implies b or c.  Let's do B or C first so a and Plies you guys remember what it is.  Not be not not be and not see.  then treat that whole thing as one proposition and  translate this to  well, let me just write my little cheat sheet up here PN Plies Q This is equivalent to does anybody remember?  Not p and not Q.  Thanks for the news that to translate this and you get not.  A and not not not be and not see and then get rid of the double negative.  Okay. Can I can I get rid of this parentheses?  because of the associativity  yes, right.  Are there any questions?  So yeah, so we did that and then we got that.  Okay, so  Let me just give you guys a little preview.  Of what we're doing.  The show you one little thing before you go. So the next thing we're going to do I want you to maybe think about this. How would you do it? We're going to try to reverse-engineer these things so I'll give you a truth table. How do you make a proposition out of it? What's a proposition that will give me that? How do I fill in that? "
