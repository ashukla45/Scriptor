What kind of what?  derivatives  I know there's going to be no trig.  logs exponential's polynomials and  I think that's it.  White Lightning.  alright, so  maybe let's go over this because what's up? What I wanted to do today was kind of just go through some examples mainly from last quarter's exam that I gave so  it could be like helpful, but you know, this would be something that you know, it's a potential type of question. So let's sum let's look at any more detail. What do you say?  Okay. Do you remember the question or?  Okay 5 factions.  25 candidates, okay.  Okay, so Chris and  Caleb  Are not in the same faction, is that what it was?  Okay.  And everybody has to go to exactly one faction.  everybody  gets assigned  a faction  Yes, right. Okay, so  So Chris and Taylor. Those are the only two that you really have to worry about. Everybody else can just go to their faction and they don't care about Chris and Caleb. Is that right?  Okay, so figure out where Chris goes how many choices does Chris have?  How many choices does Taylor have?  And then how about the other?  23 candidates  Is that what you guys got?  What's your question?  No, that'll give you the same amount 20.  Frank so it doesn't matter what order you put them in but you just put them in a order and then that looks like a 6  you're saying why don't we consider Caleb first and then Chris yasso?  That would just be counting things more than once suppose. So let's just call the factions 1 through 5.  I know they have like better names, but let's just call him 1 to 5. Okay, so choices to choose right? Maybe he chooses 3 right choices to choose from the Romaine remainder. 124 + 5 + 503 Taylor was going to five.  And there's no other way. We could have picked that ordered pair if we're doing it this way, but if we switch around the order Caleb goes first maybe he picks five first and then crispix three from the remainder. Now, you've counted that same hair twice.  Where can I help?  Me a question.  No, because the order does make a difference here.  rank  Caleb going to three and Caleb go into 5, that's different than Caleb going to Five & Taylor going to three right? So the order.  If there is those those orders are different or those assignments are different.  Any other questions about that one?  Okay. So let's just do a few other examples for most of these I'll give you all a few minutes. I'd like for you to talk it over with your neighbors. Ask questions to me or we can kind of figure them out together. Okay, so a bank ATM ATM personal identification number or pin?  It is string of four digits for a digit is defined as an integer from 0 to 9 if a valid so you could really just pick whatever pain you want. Right, but maybe the bank wants to restrict some of the pins. So if it says invalid pin cannot have two consecutive digits that are the same.  As in to 1 1/4 or anything like that.  That's not my PIN.  Just put that up as an example.  How many possible valid pins are there and then if there are no restrictions on the digits how many possible pins are there? Okay, so just give you a few minutes raise your hand if you're kind of stuck on the way to start or if you want to talk about your reasoning things like that. Ready go.  Okay.  Are they different or the same UK?  Can you read it for me?  Mercedes again  and they're in a circle to start.  You arrange them in a circle.  So you just saying that you can rotate rotations of the circle do not change the right that what you mean quotations or rotations and flips.  No, I'm asking you cuz those are two different questions.  I never specified.  It depends on what your problem is, you're talking about like people sitting in a room. You can't put that upside down.  If you're talking about maybe like the ways that you arrange beads around a necklace or something then yeah, you can put that necklace around.  You can't put everybody upside down.  Well, then you would not be at it when that be on that be a different configuration.  Are are identical objects, or are they different objects?  Yep.  You could yeah.  But those are two different problems / 2.  Yeah, and every rotation flip you can get ya.  Okay question.  longevity of a chimpanzee  Yeah.  prison sex offender in the Big O  fmg  A person age of an energy is in HIV and then F + G is in Asia van.  Stop right now. I know this is wrong.  All right. What do you guys say for number one?  right  Okay, good. How about number two?  Okay. Good any questions?  Okay, good. You guys are good.  All right. What about if the valid pain must have four different digits then how many possible Valley pins are there? And then what if they're valid pins have to have four digits in increasing order ready to go?  Where are these these were the just one?  pictures of women  All right.  Would you guys get for number one?  10 * 9 * 8 * 7  No, yes, cuz I want to be different.  Or if you like P10, for okay, how about the next one?  What is it?  any questions  Try to talk to your neighbor try to convince yourselves of this or prove me wrong.  Call Ric Flair.  Oh.  Okay, do you guys believe me now?  Any questions or comments?  No, because I have to be in increasing order.  and different  aren't you choose?  choose a subset  Of the digits, right?  of size 4  Didn't you have a set? It's a subset that means it's a set just means that the elements are either in or out they don't have any order in the set. Then you take those elements and you arrange them in increasing order and there's only one way to do that. Is it kind of makes sense?  Yes, right.  Yes.  One sided now.  It's a double-sided.  Whatever it says on Piazza again.  Okay, any other questions or comments?  What is this song?  What have been said decreasing?  Same thing might you choose this elements that you can put them in that order.  What is examples like the population rate?  Play Caillou have to make it three out of five five card.  Would like a standard deck of 52 cards.  Thank you.  So this is this is the strategy that we're doing is we're not picking the numbers one by one we're picking four of them at once.  That's what we're doing here. So you pick all four of them and then you can arrange them. However you want but we want it to be increasing.  You have to pick all four of them at once. And so that means you're right. The the highest number that you can have as a minimum has to be seven. Right but that will come out in whenever you're picking numbers in this right. That's what this will do for you.  Okay some more Counting.  What about if the pain has to have exactly two nines or what has to have three different digits?  Take a take a moment to do these ones.  because  Wake me up at 9.  Okay, how do you guys do this one?  Any questions about that?  The four choose to is is counting. What what is the four choose to the significance?  positions of nines  and this is the values of other positions.  Okay, what about if I said instead of exactly I said at least?  Okay good count with the compliment. So how many are there total?  And how many are there without to 9?  Good do 19409.  right  209 would be what?  and 1/9  how many?  4 * 10 + 4 * 9  that okay.  Play this is for the at least what's another way we could count it?  What about you just said for 9.  3/9  + 2/9  would you guys be surprised if these are the same number here?  Does anybody know why?  It's the binomial theorem. Remember one plus this kind of interesting connection.  That that's one nine.  You're choosing the position of the nine and then you're choosing the values of everything else.  This is this is exactly two nines. Right exactly. Exactly. 09 exactly one 9 exactly two nines and exactly three guys. And what's this one?  Exactly four nines only one way to do it.  44 * 9 to the zero kind of see the pattern.  Okay, good. How about this one?  10 *  4 choose 2 times  9 * 8  Where do all those factors come from?  Where's the 10 come from?  Or maybe what's a way to kind of think about this problem? If there's three different values they can only really come in like one sort of form. Right? Do you have to have a pair of one value? And then the other two have to be Singleton, right? That's the only way that you can have exactly three values if you only have four positions  Turn to 10 is the value of the pear.  What's what's the four choose two?  positions of pear  9 and 8 are the values.  of other positions  there any questions  Yeah, okay. So it's a good question. What does it mean the value of the pair? And as I do this, I want you to follow along with this sort of reasoning. Okay now.  This is the type of object that we're counting and this is the expression that were counting it with. Okay. So one good way to check your work or at least kind of  See if you're on the right track is see if you can come up with another thing that discounts and if you can come with up with a bijection between the two, okay?  so  let's rearrange this a little bit and actually say that this is equal to a let me get myself another slide.  Another slide. How do I do that?  It's what is it 10 times 9 times 8.  * 4 choose 2. I just kind of rearrange the numbers around. Okay 8-count. What does that look like?  Right. It's like permutations of length 3 from a size from a set of size 10, right? So I think now it's just kind of think about one at random. Okay, let's pick a random.  sequence of digits  but the digits have to be different right? So let's pick one at random. Let's say 3:05.  What does 4 choose 2 count? What are the kind of objects that come out of 4 choose 2?  Right. It's the yeah, it's the it's like the sets of size 2 from a set of size 4.  Write this is going to be the positions. But let's just think about it at first like what is the object that we're counting? Right? So this would be like a permutation 10-3. This would be kind of like to element.  subset  1 2 3 4  So, let's pick one at random. Let's just say maybe to 4th.  Okay.  So I have a pair of objects, right?  And what I need to do with this pair is construct a pin with the with the requirements. Okay, and it needs to be a bijection which means like their needs to be no ambiguity of what pain it is. And also he needs to be well-defined enough, but I can go backwards. Okay, so I'm going to assign certain traits to this. The first element is going to be the value of the pear.  And then these ones are going to be values.  of other  positions  and this is going to be the positions of the pear.  Text shop. Now. I have a rule to build it. So that means that I have four positions. I'm going to put the three in the second and fourth position and then I'm going to fill in the positions in the same order that they're filled their 05.  So this is the pin that corresponds to this pair of values in this pair of values is the pair of values corresponding to the pin so you can go back and forth any any pain with this property. I can give you a pair of values that better this form any pair of values of this one. I can give you a pin with this property.  Okay, good question.  So I have another there's another pen and this is a different pain, right? What pair of values does this correspond to?  This goes to that this would correspond to 350.  with two four  I should be like that,  make me see these are two different pairs of objects. So they should correspond to two different pins.  kind of makes sense  the first three positions here, but they they could be the same.  Oh, so you're counting then in in different sets you're saying if the first three positions are different than count this way.  but that's going to be  remind me that will work.  I know but but this last one has to match one of these three.  Yeah, remember because you need to have a pair.  another thing  what to do I can options with first element 9 options for sale.  8 options for the third element and it's for the last element that needs to match one of the  Where are you? There was only three options, but what am I?  Okay, good question.  Let's go to another slide here.  So you're doing 10 * 9 * 8 * what?  * 3  But that is assuming I think somebody said it that.  Yeah, the last position has to be part of a pear.  Yeah, you could cuz you could have a pin be like to 215 and then you wouldn't have that last thing.  No, that won't help either.  Because you're going to be counting.  Going to be counting every pin two times exactly two times. So if you actually want to multiply this if you multiply this by 4 / 2  so start so we could do the same the same.  Game right figure out whatever is this thing counts and then whatever that thing counts and come up with a way to buy check them, but maybe we shouldn't go through that whole thing.  So do this for these four first numbers, it basically gives you a way where the last number is a is a repeat. So let's just come up with one right five.  15 Wright  No, no, I haven't used the four choose to.  So wait why?  Is this the same thing?  Because you counted.  OKC  this is going to correspond to two different things. Just going to score to find a 2515 and I would say maybe  He said to come up with a rule.  No, I wouldn't do it that way because this is getting a little complicated.  Let's see this one right times for this was your original plan. Right? And what is that for mean?  four possible positions  Oh, I see what you're saying. So you're looking at this and then now you can place this guy in all of these four positions.  like that  Okay, so let's call this one this one five star.  Okay.  Yeah, so then you've counted to 5 * 551 + 255 * 100 every single possible thing has been counted twice because of the  okay.  4 * 3  so then you * 2  using this logic you need to kind of X some more things to be able to talk about how to arrange them because this is a set of three.  Is not an arrangement of three it's a set and so you really want a sequence of three.  Yeah, that's what we did.  Right, we use P of 10-3 we're permuting those three and then and then you're figuring out where to put the double.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah that would work. And then maybe that goes along with what you're saying. So what he's doing here, let's change this around a little bit.  You choose the three numbers that you're going to work with right? Then you choose one of them one of those three to be the double.  Right, then you arrange them in all the possible ways that you could.  Then you divide by 2 just for the same reason because you counted each one twice.  Yeah.  That what doesn't have to match.  the last digit  yeah, that's all.  But that comes with right if there are three digit three different that means that one of them has to be a pair. One of the digits has to be a pair and the other two have to be singles.  That's the only thing that's a consequence of there be three.  But they all have to be different.  They have to be three different digits.  how to get wood one would be exactly 1 million people  No, because it has to be exactly three different digits, which means one of them has to come in a pair.  This is the only way that you can fit three digits into four is if one of them is paired one of them appears twice and the other to appear once it's the only way to fit a minute.  Yeah.  Okay, I think this is the last step in problem.  He must have at least one even digit and at least one digit that is one and how many possible valid pins are there? Maybe let's do this together.  Does anybody see any key words we can use?  Okay, good. At least one. What is that mean or what does that suggest?  Okay, good at least one even digit and at least one digit. That is a one.  and  so what is the negation of the statement?  for the compliment  must have  0  even digits  or 0 ones  that kind of makes sense. So this is what we're going to be subtracting off from 10 to the for now. Does anybody know what this word suggest we use?  write Union or inclusion exclusion  okay, so really what we're doing is we're Union in the  the set of all pins  without evens  Union with pins  without  ones  right  And so how do we do the inclusion exclusion you add the two cardinalities and you subtract off their intersection, right? So what is their intersection?  right intersection  pin  without even and without one  Okay now.  Let's count each one of these. How many pins are there without even numbers?  5 to the 4 right cuz you could use one three five and seven and nine print there's five and you can do them for time. So this this set has size 5 to the Fort how about pennswood I ones  9 to the 4 and what about pins without evens and without ones?  You can have three five seven or nine for the four.  Okay. So remember this was the compliment though, so we have to subtract this off from 10 to the 4th.  The answer will be what 10 to the fourth minus.  We have five to the 4 + 9 to the 4 - 4 to the 4.  So you can just leave your answer like this. This is kind of a nasty number if you want to.  Compute it but this is something that you know in the homework or something like that. You could leave it like this because this this tells me a lot more than then if you gave me the actual integer, right? I don't know how you got it how you got it, but if you show me this I know exactly where all these things come from.  Okay questions.  Move on.  Okay.  Now this one might be a very  Good question for people who study a lot.  It's 11 p.m. And you have 3 exams tomorrow.  And you haven't studied for any of them.  CSC math and physics you have nine straight hours to study cuz your first exam starts at 8. It is giving anybody anxiety.  Okay.  You figure that you need 3 hours to study for each topic.  Okay, and let's say that every time you sit down and study for a topic you have to at least put in what you have to do. You have to study in blocks of hours. Okay. So how many different ways can you study for the exams if you must study an hour-long blocks, so this would be some.  example where you study for math from 11 to 12 and from 12 to 1 and then computer science from  1 2 2 2 2 3 you get the idea? Okay. Ready? Go. How are you going to do it?  In figuring out how to study your studying.  It's like a meta.  problem  Are all of them you're just going to put three hours into all of them.  I'd like that to be a boy.  Okay, if anybody have a solution.  No, you don't have to you've already done it.  Which one is correct?  30 equal right  Okay, let's just quickly go through them. So this one is you pick the three hours that you want to work on the math right out of the nine. Now you have six hours left over so you pick the three to work on computer science right now. You have three left over so you pick those to work on physics.  the account for the fact that what  What's a permutation?  Okay, so  if I prefer this example, I'm working on math for the first second and third fourth fifth and a tower.  That's that's all that I need to know is which hours am I working on math? I don't order these ends. And anyway, it's just which ones they are.  You figure out you basically think about each one of these as a different.  Symbol, right?  Then you order them in any 9 factorial ways, but you've you counted things more than once right because you counted the atoms in 3 factorial ways because there's 3 factorial ways you could have arranged them and same for the Seas and the peace so that's why you divide out by those.  If it mattered in if it was like if all the subjects were different.  Yes, that is different.  Yes.  But but studying math before math is the same as studying math before math.  That's the that's the best of symmetry.  Okay, let's move on to the next one.  Okay recursive Counting.  Okay, so in basketball you can increase your score by one point free throws to points.  What do you call those?  2 pointers and 3 points, which are also words are called what three pointers?  So let's say B of n is the number of different ways which team can reach a total score of endpoint in the basketball. For example, here are four different ways that you can get 9 points. You can shoot three threes. You can shoot three ones of three or one and a two and you can shoot a 2.3 is but you could also shoot them in a different order. So we're counting these as different.  objects  stop how many ways can you do it? So we're not actually going to come up with the closed form. All I really want you to do is come up with a recurrence. Maybe we'll kind of do this one together. So write a recurrence Furby of N and explain in words by Bo n satisfies the recurrent don't forget your base cases. You don't have to solve the recurrence.  Okay. So what you want to do is start with b of n which is the set of all possible ways. You can get endpoints set of the set of a bunch of these sequence. Now what we've done before in the past and what I want you to do when you when you approach these recursive counting problem is break up that set into disjoint subsets partition it so can anybody tell me a good way to partition the set?  Based on what?  Okay, good. What what kind of score did you make first guy? So let's say this is the set.  Set of all sequences.  up to  endpoints  Okay.  And what we're going to do is we're going to split this setup.  into 3 subsets starts  with one starts  with two starts  with three  so the whole set is B Ave n how do we count these ones?  Be a 10-1 good. Why is that?  Right. Once you've made one point you have in mind as one points remaining to make and you can make them in any ordering. And so this is the discounts the number of ways you can make and -1.0 K. How about this one?  Okay, I'm just one.  Okay, so what we have here?  This one's bigger than the the big set. We have B of n  is equal to B of N - 1  Class B of N - 2  + beer + -3  this is actually is is not valid for all end. Right? How big does an need to be for this recursion to actually make sense.  Three needs to be 3 or bigger, right? So let's put that here that's important to know when the recursion starts.  Okay, so this is for n greater than or equal to 3. What about when n is less than 3?  Those are going to be the base cases, right?  Starting at the right spot. Like let's say let's say we don't want it to finally get it girl for whatever reason and we just start an  I'm just getting greater than 3 what would you do?  No.  Sure.  But it is possible to make zero points in a game.  Okay, so what do I base cases?  B20 is what 1 or 0?  One there's one way to score zero points. You just don't do it.  Just don't make any baskets.  How about bf1?  What about br-2?  How you can make a one one or two?  And maybe I shouldn't do it in stat notation.  Okay any questions?  Is it?  Oh, that's what he asked if you wanted to start this at and is it is greater than equal to 4, then you need face cases be a 1B of 2 + BF3.  You could do that. I would accept that too.  Penn zero  Be of 2 is 2.  two free throws or 1 1/2 pointer  Yeah.  The empty is the empty sequence.  No one is not the point that you'd make. This is one possible way to do it.  This is basically saying that it's possible to make zero points.  Yeah, this is Trivial. It's not always going to be one in all her problems. But in this problem it is.  Yeah, maybe it's better if we use one two, and three cuz it's kind of makes it a little bit more.  Yeah, it makes it less complicated. So instead let's forget about being zero and we have be of 2 is too and this has to be greater than or equal to 4 and now we have be of 3 is what?  4  yeah, you can do a 111 you can do a 2-1. You can do a 1/2 and you can do a 3.  Have you back?  But it was move on.  solving recurrences  Let's get to this this fly. We've done a lot of  I wanted to give you guys an option opportunity to get some quicker points. So let's start with this and then we can go back and we have some time.  Okay, so we're doing a right now for True B for false.  gout  CBS  Any questions or comments?  false, right  Why the floss?  Peter Pan for  What kind of function is it?  Okay, good. It's a polynomial of degree 4. It's actually big state of into the fourth and you can't be big state of into the fourth and into the fifth member big data is the pipe down.  big questions  It is.  It's up here in 4.  remember in factorial / n - 4 factorial  but if you expand that  so it this and mine is 4 factorial will cancel out with a bunch of terms in the numerator and all you're going to be left with is and * N - 1 x + -2 x + -3  It's a polynomial of degree 4.  Okay, let's do the second one. How about number be?  Any questions or comments?  It's the same exact function, right? This is actually ate to the end in 8 to the end and so 8 to the end is big fada of a to the end and big fada implies Big O and big Omega.  Okay, how about sea?  Vlog after van is in.  Datalog, Giovanni. Vanessa van is in juven, and we're considering f and g are integer.  valued increasing function  All right. What are we doing guys?  Who's winning out?  Anybody have any questions or comments?  Okay good.  Okay, so you're saying F of n is in g o n is N squared, right?  good, so  log of n  or Lago app  is an  log of I'm sorry. I'm getting home messy here. Log of G of n  Is this is login?  Log and squared but by log rules is to log in.  Yes, sir. Log app is dictator of log G but G so this is a counterexample.  No, because M squared is not big Theta event.  That's true. Yes, if we have f is Theta of G then we do have log app is beta blocker cheap. Yes. That's true.  Okay.  How about D?  false, right  This is some constant.  greater than 0  What does it mean if the limit is some constant greater than 0?  You get fader, right? You got them all actually, right? You got spayed. Are you ghetto and you get a Mega? That's all of them.  Okay, good. And now are we just going to do this one together?  Okay, just to move on true, right?  Just kind of light by the same reasoning all of these exponent. You can bring them out in front by log rules, right?  And then basically just have a bunch of constants X logs of n right so you have this is basically big old login login. So they're big state of each other. Okay questions.  The big if it's big old that is when you get Big O for free.  Yes.  Okay.  So I have only about 5 more minutes left. I have an inclusion exclusion and some recurrences which one you guys want to see.  recurrences  directory for unraveling or the guess and check  unraveling  All right, I think Wang got through all of the slide so you can go look at his his notes and podcast for the ones that I missed. Yes.  You can get for free also. Yeah.  Big data is defined to be Big O and big Omega. That's just what it what it is. It's both of them because it's like the upper and the lower bound together.  So if you have big Omega and Big O that implies big Theta if you have big fada that implies big Omega and Big O.  Okay, so let's go through this. I'm going to label this as one.  SO2 is going to be  Ativan is three times and then inside of here.  I'm going to put what?  3 F of + -2 + 2  And in this is + 2.  Yes, right. Okay. So then let's clean this up. This is 3 squared 1/4 + -2 + 3 * 2 + 2  Okay, the third step  We're going to have three squared times.  3 F of + -3 + 2  + 3 * 2 + 2  this is 3 cubed + -3 + 2 or let's say 3 squared * 2 + 3 * 2 + 2  Okay, there's anybody see a pattern yet?  Is it going to be what's 3 to the k f of + - k + what?  2 times the sum  3 to the eye where I goes from 0 to K.  -1  this is kind of like the tricky step.  Just noticing that this is going to be a geometric sequence.  3 to the K - 1/3 - 1  This thing here is equal to that thing there.  Because we're starting at 3 to the 0 through the 0 + 3 to the 1 + 3 squared.  Okay, so then we plug in and is equal to or k is equal to n minus 1.  We got three eight to the end - 1/2 of 1 + and noticed that these two is cancel.  Surplus  3 to the N - 1 - 1  everyone is zero so that zero so we just are left with 3 to the N - 1 - 1  No, I had here. Okay. Sorry. I'm sort of out of time question.  from here to there  This is called a geometric Series. So if if this is new then you should put it on your cheat sheet.  only  When this is one did this is zero, then you plug in end cuz you want to get this thing.  down to one  the homeworks  I read the instruction hoverboard saying that you can give dances of the imitation of exponential's and stuff.
