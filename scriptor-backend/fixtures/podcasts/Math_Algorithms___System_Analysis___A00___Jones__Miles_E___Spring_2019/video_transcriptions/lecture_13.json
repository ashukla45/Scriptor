    "Full Transcript": "Okay, anybody have any questions? directions to Alaska Alright, let's get started.  Anybody have any questions?  All right. Let's just start then today. We're going to look at probability basically discrete probability.  I suppose you can kind of think about probability.  In a few different ways from kind of a combinatorial Viewpoint or kind of from an analysis Viewpoint. We're going to look at it more, tutorial, which means that our sample spaces are going to be finite sets.  Okay.  and my computer's  being weird  don't know why.  What is the weather in a probability when you're talkin about finite probability or discrete probability you have a sample space which is a set. Okay, not probability is a branch of mathematics. Right? Unfortunately, the people who develop probability decided to use a bunch of different weird terms rather than the terms already considered for mathematics. So every time I say a new vocabulary word, you'll see that there's something else in mathematics that has the same name. So when I say sample space all I really mean is set. That's it.  Okay, probability distribution is a function. Okay sign with the probabilities to outcomes in s it's a function that has a special qualities one is that all the probabilities have to be in between 0 and 1?  And the sum of the probabilities is all one.  So this also has some other consequences.  but first let's  Let's look at this.  Compare flipping a Fair coin in a biased coin. They do these have different sample spaces different distributions. Same sample space same distributions.  Okay good.  Okay, very good. They have the same sample space but different probability distributions.  What is the sample space?  Right. It's a set of all the possible outcomes. There's only two possible outcomes heads and tails. Okay. So for a Fair coin the distribution is that gives head 1/2 and Tails 1/2 in a biased coin it can give them different distributions. Okay. Let's move on to the next term.  event  So whenever you hear the word event that just means subset.  And another thing here is outcome.  means  element outcome is just a single element of a set.  Okay. So an event is a subset right? It's a it's a it's a set of outcomes. And so the probability of an event is just the sum of all the probabilities of each outcome in that event.  Okay good. So let's talk about distributions. Remember, what a distribution is. It's an assignment of probabilities to every outcome.  And each probability has to be between 0 and 1 and the sum of all the probabilities over all the outcomes has to be equal to one.  So a uniform distribution over some sample space is the distribution of where you assign every single out come the same probability and there's really only way to do that. Only one way to do. This is to assign every outcome the probability 1 / n where n is the number of elements in the set in the sample space.  So when flipping a Fair coin successfully three times, what is true?  Okay, good any questions or comments?  Three times. So what is the sample space?  It's heads heads heads.  Oh, I'm  it's really just this set right?  So that's why this one's wrong is because it says it has a probability less than one it has to have a probability of equal to one because it's the entire sample space any questions about that.  Are we walking today?  What do you mean? We're not considering the empty set.  The empty set is an event.  That is not an outcome.  And that's that sort of goes back to cst20 set theory is that the empty set right is not necessarily an element, but it's always a subset. So the empty set will always be an event of every sample space.  What's wrong with which one b?  Your pizza is always an event.  right  of any sample space  Right. Let's translate that into mathematics. This is just saying that the empty set is always a subset of any set. We learn that to be true.  is there is there is a  there is something that we can say about the empty set. What's the probability of the empty set?  Always zero no matter what?  And this sort of follows from this past slide is this thing is that the probability of any event is the sum of all the probabilities. So the probability of the empty set is the sum of nothing which is 0  Okay. So this is a uniform distribution. If you assign this was the right answer. Sorry.  If you sign 1/8 to each outcome that the uniform distribution because there's eight events and each outcome if you mean there's eight outcomes in each outcome get the same probability.  Okay, let's think about this one instead of having the sequences as the outcome instead. The outcomes are going to be either I get zero heads one head or three heads or two heads when flipping a Fair coin successfully three times. What's the distribution of the number of heads that appear?  okay, so what we can do is  We can assign a probability to each one of these outcomes. Okay, so we're changing the sample space before the sample space with was the sequences of heads and tails now the sample space is  0 heads one head two heads three heads.  Now these are the outcomes and the Distribution on these is going to be what?  probability of zero heads is  1/8 probability of one head  3 / 8  right because you could either flip the first one had the first flip the second Flip or the 3rd or the 3rd flip.  What about P of two heads?  Also 3/8 and the probability of 3 heads is 1 / 8.  Okay, any questions about that?  Which one?  Yeah, let's just write out what these refer to K.  0 heads is  all Tails, right?  One head is going to be either.  Head tail tail tail head tail or Tell-Tale head to tail.  Head tail head or tail head head and three heads just going to be heads heads heads.  I noticed that we have all eight possibilities and we're kind of like grouping them together. So now if this is my sample space, it's not a uniform distribution anymore. Right? Because there are some probabilities that are bigger than others.  Any other questions about that?  Okay good.  All right, so not a uniform distribution.  Okay good.  so  So when you have a uniform distribution, you can use counting to help out. Okay, because if every single outcome has the same probability then if you want to know the outcome of a certain event, all you have to do is count the number of elements in that event and divide out by  the total number of possible  Outcomes. Yes. Okay. So let's look at an example of digits that are the same then how many possible valid pins are there to this is just accounting question at first.  Pin can have digits.  Yeah, it's great.  I guess we're at we're under the assumption that pins.  are of length  4  with digits  0 through 9  Okay. So how many possible valid pins are there with this?  with this restriction  I think we might have seen this problem before already.  Is anybody now?  Good, it's 10 * 9 * 9 * 9.  Okay. So now the question is  What is the probability that a randomly-selected four digit number has the property that no two consecutive digits are the same? Okay. So we're under the assumption when I say this that every single pin is equally likely.  Okay, and whenever I say something like this such that all outcomes are equally likely this is a clue.  to tell you that  this is a uniform distribution.  Okay, and whenever you have a uniform distribution probability just turns into a straight counting problem where you just count the number of.  Elements in the event divided by the number of elements in the Subspace. So you have 10 times 9 cubed / how many possible pins are there?  10 to the 4th and then you get  0.7 to 9.  Okay, any questions about that?  All right good.  All right. Let's do another exercise.  A valid pin now must have four different digits that must be in increasing order then how many possible valid pins are there? If every pin is equally likely. Okay ready go?  How old is Kevin Game of Thrones?  Okay. Do y'all remember how to count these no?  Yes.  How many digit how many pins have four distinct digits in increasing order?  so 10 shoes for  rent /  10 to the 4th. So 10 choose 4 is what 210 divided by 10000  Jason isn't there's a 2% chance that if you pick a random PIN, they'll be an increasing order or 2.1 any questions.  Okay.  My next one.  Do you need the PIN to have exactly three different digits? How many possible pallet valid pins are there now? Okay. Ready go.  Oh want me to move this?  You don't want it to be influencing your decision, right?  What's the forecast for today?  What time is it in Germany?  What's the weather like in Brooklyn?  Okay, really? You think it's a 50-50 chance is this a coin flip? Whatever pain you got you see they're going to have three different digits or it's going to not have three different dishes equally likely.  Good. Let's try it out. Remember if there's three different digits. Then you need to have a pair plus two singles.  right  Okay, so  you need to figure out which positions do you want to put the pear?  Then you can pick any of the numbers to be the pair. Okay, so this is the  pared number  * 9 because you need the next number to be different.  X 8 because you need the next number to be different.  And this turns out to be what?  4320  any questions  Good.  We still have a lot of people hoping that it's 50/50.  You're going to over count.  You're going to count the same.  10 more than once  Hairless look at it.  What the  okay, so your approach is to  choose three numbers  from 10  Okay, choose three numbers from 10:10 to 3.  Okay, then what?  No, but you need you might choose another digit that's you need to have exactly three digits. She might choose another digit. That's not one of those three.  You need exactly three digit. So for example 6221 this has exactly three different digits in order for that to happen. One of the digits needs to be paired up and the other two need to be singles.  What does instituted changes every time?  Choosing one of those to be the duplicate. Yeah, but now you're doing  all right. So like if I choose three numbers that say I chose 5/6 and 8. How do I know what order to put them in?  Any other questions comments?  What about distension treatment pictures on?  What about it?  your double  you mean * 4 factorial?  why only four  What's 4 / 2?  I got to work.  This is the same as we had before.  Say what?  So if the length is 5 and you need three different digits, you can have it in a few different ways, right? You could have it as like x x y y z or x y y y z rank you can have like two pairs in a single or you can have two singles in a triple leaving only two different kind of scenarios you can have with five.  That kind of makes sense. So it's kind of special the four.  Well, yeah these ones I don't know Peter needs to be good exercises.  Okay, let's move on.  So this is what we've been doing, right?  If we start with the uniform Distribution on a set in the probability of an event e is the size of e / the size of X. Okay. So if I'm flipping a Fair coin and times or I'm flipping in Fair coins with say what's the probability of getting exactly K heads?  Okay good. So first thing we need to do is count e-account the event the event is  the set of all sequences of coin flips that have exactly K heads. Let's turn these sequences of coin flips into binary strings where a heads is a one and a tails is a 0 right we can say  or the event  Tom is equal to  all sequences  heads and tails  with exactly  K heads, I should say all and sequences, right? So this is the this has the same number. I guess I could do this, right? This is the same as the number of all  and bit strings  with  exactly  K ones right  you change all the heads to ones and all the tale two zeros. These are the same. This is a bijection between those two set. We know how to count this very well, right we've seen this many many times before this is just n choose k  Then the total number of possible sequences.  Flips is the same as the total number of bit string switch is to to the end.  Any questions about that?  was that  and yeah that I put a 10 sequences so length and sequences.  Okay good.  So if we start instead of doing the sample space as the sequences if we change the sample space into how many heads were getting kind of like we did in the other example now we're talking about a different distribution. It's called the binomial distribution.  Okay, so now our sample space.  Is 0 heads one had two heads three heads all the way up to an heads.  Right. And so what's the probability that we get K heads it turns into this.  Okay now.  What is one of the things we said has to happen for probabilities the sum of all the probabilities of all the outcomes should be equal to one, right?  So that means that he of zero heads + P of one head + P of two heads +... + P of an heads.  What is I equal?  It should equal one. But what is it? What is it equal symbolically into 0.  Plus and shoes 1 + and shoes 2 +... + and shoes and all over to the end. Does anybody remember what this is supposed to equal?  Remember we did this I think the second week.  Remember we did a combinatorial proof cuz this is all of the subsets of all the sizes and this is just all the the subsets at all or another way to think about it. This is all the end bit strings with any number of ones and this is all the end of strings at all. At least it works for the binomial distribution is not uniform because it's not going to give every outcome an equal chance, but it is a distribution because it sums up to one hand and follows all the things.  Okay. So what if the coin is not fair what happens then?  No, it still wouldn't be the every distribution has to have this property or else it's not probability.  Right. Okay. So a Bernoulli trial is a fancy way of saying a experiment that has two outcomes. Okay, so like flipping a coin Wayne or is anybody have any other?  examples  getting rejected  passing a midterm  staying in CS after a certain number of years.  I have to beat that has to be two choices. But the thing is is that these choices don't have to be equally likely to be or not to be.  Is it going to rain tomorrow?  is my  I don't know if I'm playing cards is my hand going to be at my going to get two pair or a flush or something, right? So  Well if your question is is my hand going to be to pair.  Then it is or it's not right or am I going to win this game of basketball or am I going to win a game of Solitaire or bite so you can think about all of these kinds of things?  okay, so in a binomial distribution the problem so in a binomial distribution, there's always two outcomes and  You always say that one of them is a success and one of them is a failure. I don't know why they always say that for all of them, but that's how it is. Okay, so Bernoulli trial also has a binomial distribution if if each thing is equally likely and if it's not then what's going to happen.  Okay.  what if  What if a success has probability p?  What is that mean a failure has?  probability of success  is equal to p  so the probability of a failure  Is what?  1 - P good with the probability of a success is a p probability of failure is 1 - p  What is the probability of if you did the Bernoulli trial end times you got exactly K successes?  Okay good.  So let's just kind of look at an example so you can get get an understanding of where this comes from. Okay, so this is the right answer d  Okay. So suppose I'm saying that lets a n is equal to 10 + K is equal to 4, right? So what's one possible way? I could have gotten exactly four successes. Maybe I started out with a few failures and then I had a few successes and then a failure and then a success and then a few more failures and then a success and then a failure one, two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine ten. This is one possible way. I could have achieved for successes. So what's the problem?  Well, it's each of that. Each event is independent, which means it doesn't depend on the previous thing happening. And so when events are in De Pere  I guess things will be outcomes write each outcome is independent of the other side means it's not dependent on the other one happening.  So that means that their probabilities * so this is going to be  1 - P * 1 - p x p x p  * 1 - P * p  1 - P * P * 1 - P. So in this example P to the 4 * 1 - P to the six, right?  And this is this is just one possible way. How many different possible ways could I have achieved exactly 4 successes?  You think about it as a binary number with zeros and ones right? How many ways can I get a length of 10 bit string with exactly for once? It's going to be 10 choose 4.  Honey, just right at 10 shoes for possible.  ways to get  or successes  Okay, stop in general when you have and trials and K successes. There's n choose K many ways to actually get that scenario to happen. And each one of those outcomes has a probability Pita Decay one might have. - k  can we also counts as I can fit?  Kobe 10 shoes six possible ways to get six failures, but remember 10 to 6 is always equal to 10 choose 4.  remember the  okay good.  Okay, let's move on conditional probabilities. So sometimes if you know something about the outcome.  Then you can use conditional probabilities and it would change the probability of something happening. Okay, so the probability of an event may change if you have additional information about the outcomes, so let's suppose that E and F are two events and that the probability of f is not zero.  then  this is called a conditional probability and it's red.  the probability  e given F K. So given that f is going to happen. What's the probability that he also happens?  okay, and so it's the intersection of e and 1/2 / the probability probability of intersection / the probability of f  let me give you more of like an intuitive way to think about this. Let's say that this is my entire sample space.  Okay, and he Rizzy the eventi and here is the event f  Okay.  Now I know let's say that I know that whatever the outcome is. It's got to guarantee that it's going to be an F. So really what you're doing is you're taking your sample space and kind of shrinking it down to just app.  Write this is going to be kind of like my new sample space and the what I want to know is what's the probability that he happens. So I know that I'm in a safe. What's the probability happens? Well, it's just that intersection.  But then you have to divide out by the probability that F happened that kind of makes sense.  Okay. So this is what we get and then we get this also and we'll look at that in a little bit more detail a little later. Are there any questions?  Okay.  next problem  Okay suppose you're on a gameshow. Okay, and  there's three doors.  And there's a car behind one door.  And there's two goats behind the other two doors.  Okay, and let's just suppose that you desire a car over a goat.  so  You're trying to get the car.  So what's with the with the game show host ask you to do is pick one of the doors.  So you go and pick one of the doors and you stand in front of it.  You don't open it yet. Then the game show host opens one of the other doors and reveals a goat and then he gives you the option. Do you want to keep the door you originally pick or you have the option to switch to the other door? That hasn't been opened yet?  What do you do?  Do you always switch do you always stay or does it not matter because it's a 50-50 chance.  Okay good.  Let's see what the reasoning is here.  Okay, so maybe you've heard this already before or maybe you you have a good intuition, or maybe you think it should be one way and it's not another way. This is a very this is a notoriously tricky problem to wrap your head around if you haven't seen it before in fact, it was so tricky that  that back in the 90s.  Marilyn vos Savant was a prodigy with record scores and IQ test who wrote an advice column in the newspaper. I think and in 1990 a reader ask for the solution of this puzzle. And so she correctly gave the right solution.  After that happened thousands of readers demanded that she correct her mistake and these included professors and PhD and professors in statistics. It was like is that crazy to think that it wasn't a 50-50 chance that there was a winning strategy that always swapping actually did result in a better probability that you got a car.  OK Google the simulator and and prove them all wrong.  So let's think about why swapping is a good idea.  Okay, so  Each one of the doors you can or the distribution of the cars in the goats is at random, right? You don't know what it's going to be. They could equally be in any of the door. So  When you choose a door, there's a two-thirds chance that you're going to choose a goat and a 1/3 chance that you're going to choose the door with the car, right?  Your first door.  Is a goat.  one third chance  your first  door is a car either case.  but the  the game show host opens another door and reveals a goat, right?  Okay, so it's your first at the first door that you choose as a goat and he reveals the other goat then if you change you got a car, right?  Yes, yes.  if you change  you get  hey car.  Okay. Now if you pick the car and the other two were goats if he reveals a goat and you change you get a goat, right?  So basically every time you change you get something different than what your first choice was.  And you had a two-thirds chance of picking a goat.  So that means if you picked to go out your first choice and then you change your going to get a car right? Then you have a 1/3 chance of picking a goat. So 1/3 chance you pick a go and you change no 113 spigner car.  You pick a car your first choice and you change you got to go. Okay, so that means that you have a 2/3 chance of getting a car if you change in a 1/3 chance of getting in.  any questions  So they're Five Doors.  And how many goats do you have?  for goats  1 car  okay, and I pick a door and then how many how many doors does the does the game show host open?  Oh.  host opens one door  And then you switch and then he opens another door and then you switch again and you open another door.  Yeah, I'd say always switch keep on Switching right because at the end you just going to be two doors left over.  Yeah.  Big Sean  any other questions or comments?  in this one or the original  the five-door one  BMW have to be doors that I don't  Yeah, I think it's the same, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll be more it would be more than 2/3.  Yeah.  No, no, he always open the door with a goat.  He always opens a big outdoor.  Give me  yeah, you have a better than 2/3 chance.  Okay, let's move on.  So let's think about another kind of conditional probability question. Let's suppose that I say that the probability that two siblings are girls. If you know that the oldest one is a girl. What is the what is that probability in the probability that two siblings are boys if you know that one of them is a boy assume that each child being a boy or girl is equally likely are these probabilities equal are they different or are you not sure?  And you know what?  All right good.  They're not equal.  I know.  a disappointing, right  That's disappointing.  Yes.  No.  It's equally likely that the next child is going to be a boy. Let's go through the conditional probability through the math and maybe you'll  maybe that will help out.  Okay, let's look at this one. First the probability that two siblings are girls. If you know the oldest is a girl. What is the sample space here?  Well, you could have a girl and then a girl you could have a girl and then a boy you could have a boy and then a girl or you could have a boy and then a boy, right?  Was that now this is just a sample space. This is just saying if you have two children and we're under the assumption that there's only two genders for this problem. Sorry for being  you know.  I'm not accepting.  or  you can I don't know how to say it.  This is a dated question.  Yes.  Okay, let's just assume that there's only girls and boys. I know that that's not.  PC but let's just say that that's what it is. These are the only four possibilities with that assumption now.  The initial Distribution on the sample space is what?  Uniform write each one of those is equally likely what events are we conditioning on?  Well, we're conditioning on the vent the event that you know, the oldest is a girl.  So what is that event? It's the event GG, GB.  right  Oh, I guess I should say that.  This would be like the first born in the second born.  Whatever you like.  Okay. So let some let's go with this probability here what events are we conditioning on to our girls? Okay. So how come for the oldest is a girl is Gigi a GB?  And outcomes where the two are girls is just GG.  Right inside the probability of B given a is equal to the probability of a intersect B / the probability of a which is what the probability of a intersect B. Will Andrew said be is just Gigi. So the probability of a intersect B is 1 / 4  Probability of a well, it's two events out of four. So that's one half.  And you get 1/2? Okay. So if I know the oldest is a girl then the probability that they're both girls is 1/2 any questions about that.  Okay, so that's what we did here we get one half.  Okay now so we get 1/2 what about if we know that one of them is a boy. Now what conditions events are we conditioned? Hang on?  if one of them is a boy then  we have three conditions or three outcomes B B B G & G B.  So this is what's going to change.  Okay. So if C is the outcomes where one is a boy and D is outcome where to our boys then the probability of see now is 3/4 and the probability of D is 1/4. This is also the probability of C intersect D. So the probability of the given C is equal to probability of C intersect D / probability of C, which is 3/4.  No.  1/4 / 3/4 which is 1/3.  So it's more likely that two siblings are boys if I know that one of them is a boy know it's less likely.  And it's more likely that the two siblings are girls if you know the oldest is a girl.  Okay, pretty crazy, huh?  any questions  That would be a 5 time that you have.  94  and I like to help more possibility of their children.  Yeah, it's because you're it's because in the first one you are you're pinning down, which of the two children is a girl right? And so  That makes the the Avenger conditioning on smaller, right?  every possibility of five  Right. Yeah, because this one you're being a little less specific. So that means that you're the event your conditioning on is bigger, right? So you kind of have like more chances you have more options until you have a less probability.  pictures of a bigger sample space  Okay, so  so probability can kind of mess with your mind and your intuition could be tricked. Here's another example of that. It's called Simpson's paradox.  If I gave you this data.  Okay, this is data.  Taken from the comparison of treatment of renal calculi by open surgery percutaneous nephrolithotomy an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy buddy know what that refers to.  kidney stones  so these are needed to kidney stones treatment treatment and treatment B. And here are here is the data that you you have. Okay. So which treatment is better treatment a for all cases treatment be for all cases a for small and be for large or extra-large MP4 small?  What do you all say?  Okay, let's see what you all say. A lot of people are saying treatment a for all cases and you know, we have some other things here. It's a little hard to pin down. Right? What do I mean by all cases?  Well if you add up all the successes.  Bright Angel, bye bye all the trials  then it's clear that treatment be is better, right?  So I should go with treatment be except for if I want to do large Stones treatment is better if I want to do small stones treatment is better.  So which one is better?  What treatment be is better over? All right.  Okay, so this is a paradox. Okay. Have fun with that one.  I don't know. I mean what a treatment bee is going to put this on their on their advertisement was going to put this on their advertisement.  They're going to say we can beat we beat a guy in a combined test and they say we beat be in each test. Which one do you believe what you can actually believe both of them cuz they're both right.  Yeah, you can.  Exactly. So even though treatment B is  is  Less for small stones they've done a lot more trials, right and they're still pretty high. So it's all about how do you read the data? What what kind of information do you get to go exclusively by comparing percentages or do you go by experience or this kind of thing? So data can be warped. We all have seen it before but this is just another example and you can kind of  One sort of intuition is that when the less effective treatment is applied more frequently to easier cases. It can appear to be a more effective treatment over. All right.  And maybe this you could also think about this in terms of like grades or something where you're you're comparing yourself to another person and maybe your grade point average is less than theirs, but they've only taking easy classes the whole time right? So does that make that person smarter than you or better than you will  I don't know.  Does it make that person more more more attractive candidate for graduate school or like a career or a job or internship? I don't know. Sometimes they they look at just the raw score in which case that person will have an advantage and sometimes they look at what classes have you actually taken in which case you will have the advantage right? So sort of like the same sort of thing question or coming?  Is that have to do with this?  Yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean you get a better sense over the more experiments right? It couldn't it could be that out of these 87 experiments. They just got really lucky a lot of them.  But you never know.  I don't think so.  Okay.  Let some let's move along independent events. Okay. So two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the likelihood of the other event Okay, so  What that means is that when you have the conditional probability.  Key of E given F. If they're independent, then that means this is going to equal p a v e right basically if I know information about F and it doesn't affect the probability of e happening. That means that those events are independent.  I just gave you the answer.  Okay.  Sorry.  Okay, but does that make sense?  Probability given app is just a probability of basically F doesn't matter. It doesn't it doesn't help with calculating the probability of eat.  No.  no, because if they're independent and dependent given f is equal to p a v e  MPG of a forgiving e is going to be equal to P of f  so they're going to be different.  Okay.  So if I have this, well, let's replace p a v give an f by its definition.  Which is the intersection / the probability of f x both sides by PFF and now you have a equivalent but different definition of Independence.  alternative  definition  of Independence  sky, so that means that they're their intersection is going to be there a product of their probabilities.  Okay.  Let's think about this example where my sample space now is all for bit strings and he is going to be the event or the subsets of all strings that start with one.  And F is the event that the string contains an even number of ones.  What can you say about EMF?  If each bitstring is equally likely are they independent? Are they disjoint? What are your impressions? What are your intuition say?  Maybe how you can think of it as let's say I had like a bit string on this table, but it was covered with a  A curtain, right?  And you want to know?  Does it start with a one right? If I tell you that there's an even number of ones in the bitstream. Does that give you any more information? Are you more confident that it starts with a 1 or less confident or does it change it all?  Okay, so we're Sam Bee.  Okay.  Sophie is correct.  Any questions about that?  Why are they independent? Well, let's do the calculation.  What's the probability of E?  Well, how many 4-Digit bit string start with a 1?  half of them write 8  how many bit strings have an even number of ones?  Also have right.  And we can even we can even list them.  1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0  wait, how many am I doing for a crap? I got to list all of those.  1001  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 and 1 1 1 1 write this one here is all the ones that have an even number of ones so that 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 0 0 and what else?  One one one one one.  So you can you can certainly see from from this list is that they're not disjoint right? They have one when they have this one, right? So the definitely not disjoint, but what is there?  a1010  how come they look like? They're the same length?  Right, that's too long. Okay, what is their intersection?  Well, you have one one one one. You have one one zero zero you have one zero one zero and you have one zero zero one.  and so now look  Their intersection is 1/4 the product is also 1/4.  And we can take that as an alternate definition of being independent. So since their intersection is equal to their product the intersection of the the probability of the intersection is equal to the product of the probabilities there for their independent any questions.  Okay good.  so  Let's go back to conditional probabilities just in general, right so now we're not under the assumption that they're independent anymore. We just have conditional probabilities.  This is how we Define them.  Right and so we can rearrange them to be this right? This is this is just multiplying both sides by P of that.  So this is p l e intersect f is equal to that right? But now we know that intersection is what is this rule commutative right also equal to if you switch everything around right? So now we have a quality.  of these two things  probability  you give an f  probability of f  Is equal to probability of a given e x probability of E?  Okay, then multiply or divide out by probability of e and we get this nice equation here.  They say this is just this is just a result of manipulating the  the probabilities right? We haven't really done much here.  This thing is called does anybody know?  Bayes theorem  and what we can do with Bayes theorem is infer the conditional probability of a given e based on the probability of B given at  Guy in this is a powerful theorem. It's a powerful tool.  And it's also kind of tricky because it's not always what you seem. What what what it seems and  Yeah, it it's like one of those things I could trick you.  okay, so instead of writing probability of Z, we're going to replace probability of Eevee with  probability of e given f  x probability of f  Plus probability of e given F compliment X probability of a complement.  And haven't really talked so much about why I can do this, but just think about it in terms of either my either.  My occurrence is going to be in a four is going to be out of that. Okay. So this just kind of considers both of those cases if it's an f and this is a probability if it's out of a and this is the probability and now I'm considering both of those sets together. And so it's the probability of all of them. Is there some  and we got this nice.  Statement of Bayes theorem a few more minutes here. Let's look at one more example just to give just to get like a an initial feeling of what you could use Bayes theorem for and why it could be a little misleading. Okay. So based on previous probabilities of two events relate to one another how does knowing that one event occurred impact the probability that the other occurred?  Okay, so you can do this you can use it.  when you're talking about  certain things that have a success rate, right and what you want to do is figure out well.  If I got a success or if I got a failure, what's the probability that I actually succeeded or actually failed right? And so think about it like in this particular example, there's a drug test that detect steroid use 95% of the time.  And then it says 15% of all steroid free individuals also test positive K. So you need to know all the information before you can make a honest decision.  Okay, I mean this is a great number to show a very high probability. But this is also important when you wanted when you want to ask certain questions. So let's say that 10% of the Tour de France bike racers use steroids and your favorite cyclist just tested positive. What's the probability that he actually used steroids?  Okay good.  So we're going to see on Thursday.  It's actually more close to 40%  And so it kind of  I see you all on Thursday. "
