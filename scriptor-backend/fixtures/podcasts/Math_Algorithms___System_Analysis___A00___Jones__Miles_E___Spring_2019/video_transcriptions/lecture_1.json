I'll be one of the instructors of this course the other instructor Quang Bach. He's going to be teaching the 8 a.m. Class, but we're going to allow for.  Homework groups to be coming from either section. So we're going to be sharing our resources rta's. Our tutors. Our lecture slides are midterms are going to be similar the in the homework is going to be the same.  So this is the website. We're also sharing website. So this is the website and you can find a lot of information on their having to do with the syllabus the schedule the homework.  People's office hours and things like that.  Okay, let's see. Where do I put my pen?  Okay, good. So, what are we doing in this class? What is it about?  I'm hoping that most of you have taken CSE 20. So this is sort of like the next following class for that. We're going to use a lot of material from CSE 20 and kind of extend some of it and use some of it for some other things.  This class is kind of loosely based around algorithms. But on top of that we're going to do we going to explore some other parts of mathematics that are related to algorithms. Maybe not directly, but that might come up.  This class is it's kind of like a prerequisite for CSE 101 mainly and so if you if you're going on to that class then this is a good will teach you a lot of things that will use in that class, too.  Okay, so formulate and solve problems were going to be solving a lot of problems in this class different kinds there going to be math problems algorithmic problems things like that. We're going to talk about how to describe data whether that be in terms of bits or in terms of different kind of data structures, like on a ray or a graph or something like that. Analyzing the algorithms. This is mainly how does show that algorithm works and how to show how long it's going to take we're going to do it all using math. So this is going to be our language that we use. So that means that all the stuff you learn from 20 is going to be your vocabulary set functions logic. We're going to be using a lot of proofs proof by induction proof by contradiction. And what else do we do in 20?  cardinality  operators operators  accountability accountability  All right, like the logic quantifiers.  This is a math course why is math part of the Cs curriculum? Well,  I like to think mainly this part. It's the vocabulary of computer science computer science is a relatively newer subject and some may argue that it is a subject with in mathematics. So the computer scientist who started thinking about these questions, they used math terminology. So that's why you'll see we're going to be using sets and functions and watching the stuff like that. The reason they did that is because math vocabulary is very useful. It's if you know how to read it and if you know how to communicate with it, then you can get your point across a lot more efficiently than if you just write out everything at words. So we're going to be relying on mathematical vocabulary to exchange ideas.  On top of that. We have proofs mathematical proof is a great way to show that something's going to work and we have quantitative analysis enough or are solutions good enough. How do you measure how good it is? Well, we can do that God by comparing numbers or comparing times.  Okay introductions. I already talked about myself. I've been teaching this class for the past few years now and the great class. I think I think we go over a lot of different things. It kind of does bounce around a lot. So just make sure that you're keeping up with it and I think you'll be all right.  So, how about everybody here? We're going to be using Clickers.  The frequency code is CB.  And let me just gather some information about people in here.  Did you take CSE 20 at UC San Diego either? Yes math, 15a is is kind of like it's the same exact course. It just has a math title or did you take an equivalent course somewhere or no for some other reason?  Okay good.  This is pretty good.  So most of the people took 20 here that's good. We're going to be relying heavily on 20. So if you took an equivalent equivalent course elsewhere  You know, it's probably you'll probably be all right. I think the main things that I want you to have as a prerequisites are basic math kind of vocabulary, like set theory and things like that and how to prove things.  Okay.  Let's go to the next question.  How do you use iclickers before it's just see.  Because this is going to be a way that first of all we can communicate with each other without me having to ask every single person what they're thinking and it also gives me an Iowa to take attendance, which we're going to be using for some participation points Rochelle get to a little bit later.  Okay, so I guess  a lot of people have used it these people in the C D and E range. So if you want to hit if you want to say yes hit head and if you want to say be do I say do you want to say no hit be? Okay, so there shouldn't be any anything here. Are there any questions are there any questions?  any questions  they are now.  Okay. Are you guys just playing around or do you not have know how to use them?  Okay. I'm just going to move on.  Okay now.  Where are you from? This is just kind of make sure that you know how to use these things.  other  planet  Okay, so this is kind of what I expected a lot of Californians a few San Diego ins.  Not many out-of-staters way more International students than out-of-state. That's kind of the way it goes here.  for these folks  Welcome to the United States these folks Welcome to California these folks welcome to San Diego and therefore these folks welcome home.  okay, so now  I'll give you all a quiz.  Where do you think I am from?  I didn't really give you any clues.  Maybe I did I don't know.  How is just like to see what kind of person do I come off as?  Okay, a Floridian, huh?  That's not right.  It's Virginia.  Yeah.  Okay, everybody knows how to use clicker. I just wanted to give you guys some practice with them.  Okay.  The next the next one again about about everybody here.  And this is a very important question that I have for you.  because  induction is going to be very important in this class. We're going to see it a lot over and over again. So I want to get kind of a sense of how you feel about induction. How confident are you very I know how to do it. It scares me or what's induction.  Okay good. So for these people maybe figure out how to use the clicker for these folks. What is induction? I'm going to have to ask you to learn it on your own you're going to there's a lot of great resources out there the book that we use. The Rosen book has a lot has a whole chapter on induction. So read that go through exercises. Look at videos figure out what it is and how to do it because it's going to come at you fast when we start looking at algorithms and stuff like that.  For these people it scares me.  It scared me to when I was a student. So I understand I know how to do it and very good. You know, we're going to we're going to be using it a lot any questions.  Great.  Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the class. There's participation points.  so every week  You can earn a maximum of four points from the following sources. Each lecture is worth two points. Each discussion is worth one point and then we're going to have a review quiz. That's also that's worth three points and we'll be uploading that probably later today or tomorrow or something and those will be do on the weekends. Okay, so you can you can get all eight possible points if you like, but we're going to cap it at cap it off at 4 per week. Okay, and then  You need to have 30 points by the end of the quarter to gain the maximum 5% participation points. Okay, anything less than 10 is point until you get to 25 or fewer. You won't get any of the participation points.  questions  Okay.  the book Rosen 7th edition  it's the great book a little bit too much of I mean not too much but has a lot more information than what we're going to be covering in this class because you know you may have used it for 20 also and so it's a good resource for review and it's a good resource for this class to  okay, so there's going to be two midterms and they're going to be  combine midterms with the other class or they're going to be in the evenings on Tuesday week for Tuesday week 8 in the final exam is also going to be combined. It's the first Saturday of finals week. So it's you know the day after the quarter ends.  stop  Okay, so some grading stuff.  how that happened  Okay, so we have two exams. You can drop the lowest midterm. If you do better on the final we can kind of play around with those percentages. There's going to be 7 homework assignments and they're all in one of them could be dropped there all group assignments.  We already talked about the participation and the details are in the I think this is not right go to the other site.  Okay. There we go.  It's on the front page. Did everybody get a slide scope invitation that's enrolled in the class. That's okay. What about a Piazza? I think I'm Piazza. You can enroll yourself. Okay, so  Grade school will be headed in gradescope. You can handle that in your group Piazza is mainly for discussions about content in the class. I or ambiguities or certain clarifications on the homework, please don't do homework discussions on the solutions. That's for that's where office hours come in. So we'll be posting all of our office hours online. Mine are going to be Fridays and they're going to start week to peso MJ.  Friday's  starting  Week 2 and I forgot what it was. I think I'm doing 11 to 1 but I'll I'll post it on the website. So y'all can see.  Okay, both of our class will be broadcasted and our slides will be uploaded to the to the website. So you'll have all those resources to.  Okay now.  Okay.  How are you going to do? Well in this class. So first of all, we're going to be posting all of the content. We're going to be covering in the week on the website. You can go there and look at what we're going to cover and link to each one of the topics. They will be chapters of the text that if you want to read ahead it might help with your understanding.  Okay engage in the class help me discuss questions. I'll pause every once in awhile and I want you to discuss with your neighbors come up with ideas. Shoot other people's ideas down. Let me know be respectful but you know just kind of let's have some nice discussions in the class reinforced after class. It's really nice that we have technology. Now that we can have access to the podcast you guys can listen to this whole thing over again as many times as you want. You can even listen to it in two times speed and somebody told me my voice sounds like  What did he say?  Anyhow if there was a comment about it, I'll try to try to remember. She have all of that access you have the slide you have to text you have us. So use all of the resources that we are giving it to excel.  Might seek help and seek help to help others with Integrity. Okay. So what do we mean by Integrity? I like to sum it up with.  Only hand in your work or the work of your group if you find a solution online.  Try to have some self-control and don't look at it if you happen to stumble upon it.  if we find that your solution looks too much like a solution online or if it looks suspicious then there's there's a chance that we will we will  Report you to the academic Integrity office, and nobody wants to go through with that on top of that when you're on when you're doing your exam. Please focus on your own page same kind of idea. I want you to hand in your own work. Not the work of somebody else. Not anybody's copy.  Okay.  So here's kind of the breakdown of the course.  We're going to start with Counting.  my favorite topic  and then next week, we'll do asymptotic notation and recurrence relations with Ben will get into algorithms and talk about how to analyze them. We'll do a whole topic on probability enumeration data representation, and then we'll end with grass. Okay, really just want to introduce everybody to how to start thinking about solving problems using algorithms and how to analyze the algorithm and how to tell whether or not one algorithm is better than the other those types of things.  You're going to learn how to present your ideas clearly rigorously using mathematical notation mathematical vocabulary.  Okay any questions before we move on?  Okay, we're going to do an activity now.  Everybody take out a piece of paper or 1/2 you could you could cut the paper in half and and take take a paper from your neighbor.  This activity is we're going to attempt to count. The number of people in this class. We're going to do it in a very algorithmic way. I want you what I want you to get out of it is what types of things are happening. What do you expect to happen in the end? Okay. So before we begin everybody put your name and your birthday you could just do them the day in the month. You don't have to put the year.  Does David month and if you don't want to share your birthday, then you can make up a birthday if you like.  Write someone on one side or in one column and some two in the other column and start each one of them out as one.  Okay. So what we're going to do is count. The number of people in this room. Everybody here together is going to be one computer. Okay, so you guys are all going to work as a team to figure this out. Okay, and the the process that you're going to go by the different iterations will be will be the same over and over again until we stopped. So this is how it goes. Okay.  If you have a piece of paper, then you are going to participate find somebody else with a piece of paper.  Nobody is available. Wait to the next round. Okay, the person would the earlier birthday.  He or she will collect all of your papers and put them under their paper. And before they do that. They're going to add the someone values together. Okay during this first step. Everybody's going to have one as there's someone so you're going to the earlier birthday going to put the other paper underneath and right, you know to under the one right? So update the someone someone you can think about as like a variable value that you're going to be updating as you go to someone values together increments. Mm2 value.  So let's do the first iteration and at the at the end of the first generation half of you guys are going to have to sit out for the rest of the the thing. Okay, ready go.  Okay, you guys completing round one?  Okay. So how many people have a paper now?  Okay about half the class, right? Okay. So those of you who don't have a paper just going to have to sit out for the rest of the time but I'm going to give you some some some questions to think about as the rest of the class is finishing up. Okay, so we're going to start with let's do around 2 and just keep on going. We're not I'm not going to stop for every round. We're just going to kind of do a big just keep just go ahead as you as you will the the last few people the January birthdays they have to get up out of their seat after a while and find somebody else but the idea is now each person has two pieces of paper the one with the earlier birthday put theirs on top and take the whole stack get you. Just keep on going. Okay ready go.  And make sure you're updating your someone values and some two values.  Does just keep going you might have to stand up and find some other people?  Okay, and for those of you who don't have any more papers?  I want you to think about these questions. You can talk about it with your neighbor.  And let me know if you have any questions about how it works or what to do.  Okay.  You don't have to get up.  Who else has papers does U2?  Thank you.  wait  We still have to.  Well, I mean whose birthday is earlier.  Well now it's the birthday on top. That's the only one that matters.  I've got the jack.  Okay. So January 4th is is before March 10. So you have to add a 10 to write 10 to yours.  Thank you.  Okay. I know anybody else any more papers.  You can put them here.  Thank you, Gabby.  Anybody else papers?  Okay, let's give everybody a round of applause.  Oh, we have some more.  Okay.  I have my pen here. Okay, great. Okay, January 5th and January 4th. So January 4th at 8. So 1:50 exactly and 13. Great. Okay. Thank you everyone.  Answer some of these questions.  What do you expect will happen? What are the kind of things that are going to be happened at work? What are the things that are going to happen at the very end?  How many people are holding papers right these kind of things? So let's think about who is going to be the last person standing.  The one with the earliest birthday is that always going to be the case?  Yes, right. We're going to  Later on, we start talking about algorithms and loop invariants with Cy, why is that the case? How are you going to convince somebody that the earliest birthday person will be the last one standing one way to to kind of figure this out or one way to explain it would be  the person with the earliest birthday or the everybody's standing has the earliest birthday in their stack.  right  Always even when we started.  So if there's one last person standing that they have their earliest birthday in their stack, right? And so that's one way to kind of think about it.  Okay, how many papers will this person have all of them? Right? So we got a hundred and fifty?  I don't know how good of a job we did but it seems like there's a hundred around 150 people in here.  What will be the value of someone?  The number of people and what's going to be the value of some 2?  the number of interactions that that person had right  Does anybody have an estimation on what some to should be?  Log base 2 of someone right? But that's if we did it like very systematically, right? We kind of kind of like a free-for-all after a while and it turns out that the sum to hear was 13.  So we had 150 and 13 traded with some people with smaller piles and things like that.  Why why would it why would you expect it to be log base 2 of someone?  Anybody have like a a reason?  Okay good right you so you double the number of paper if you're the person with the earliest birthday, you keep on doubling the number of papers in your stack until you have all of them another way to think about it is the number of people that are holding papers is going to decrease by half every iteration until you're only down to one.  Okay, how are the papers be arranged? Are they going to be in sorted order?  No.  Is the last paper in the stack going to be the person's birthday with the earliest birthday?  No, not necessarily right it's going to it's got this kind of weird order, but it's not sorted and there's nothing that you can really say about the last paper. Okay, any other questions or comments? Does anybody see any other properties that might hold or things like that?  Yeah, it is like a binary tree and in fact.  You can think about the ordering as what do you callthe isn't there like a certain ordering?  What is it called traversal?  Right. And so if you order those it would be like the  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, you go to the left and then you kind of do that until you kind of yet.  Yeah, exactly.  Anybody else?  So let's say that every iteration was some sort of computer step. How long do you how long would this algorithm take if everybody was, you know the same efficient it would be this value some to write.  Now would you if I wanted to count the number of people in this class, would you prefer that I do this activity or which one would take which one to take?  last time if I did this activity or if I count it off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  you think Counting?  Yeah, I don't know. What took you guys a while.  No, but think about maybe in this class. It may have taken like around the same amount of time. But if you make the class size a lot bigger, you know, maybe we were counting the number of students in the whole university. I think the activity would probably be a lot faster for those.  Okay.  Let's move on.  So the first kind of concept other than this activity is counting and I love counting because it was basically my thesis in grad school. So I've got a soft spot in my heart for accounting and it's also a great topic cuz you can the problems you can come up with you can be very creative because you know counting is everywhere people count all the time different combinations and things like that. So around this time last year. I just gotten back from the Yucatan and I got really inspired by all of the Ancient Maya civilization. And so I tried to make some counting problems that have to do with that.  Let's start with that cuz the Mayans had out this calendar and it had all of these cool combinations that I thought I would like to share. Okay, so here in modern-day Mexico Belize and Guatemala and maybe some of these may be some more in Honduras and El Salvador, but I don't really know it's mainly in this region. They thrived for nearly 3,500 years agriculture art writing system architecture all of this great things that great civilization hat.  Okay, so they have very Advanced calendar that you guys all may have heard of where they said that the end of the world with 2012. Did you guys ever see that movie with John Cusack wasn't that based on the Mayan calendar ending? Yeah, and then nothing happened, but you know what?  Okay, so to name their days they had 13 numbers and they had 20 like name days and each one of those name days has a different word associated with it rabbit owl storm.  monkey Frank and so  each day had a number and a name. So  this is this is this calendar is called the Vulcan calendar and each day has a number and a name. For example.  Today April 2nd 2019 is 9 Ben.  Gaben means read my birthday was on 7th n and kuang's was on one. It's knob.  Okay, every single different combination happens before it starts over again. So how many different combinations are there of the 13 number days and the 20 named days?  So you can kind of think about these as like an astrological significance if you like that kind of thing. So I think that this really describes me very well.  I'm a read so it's a very meaningful day a day of Triumph right of those who are born on this day are very lucky.  Calm and of course intelligence, which is definitely one of my characteristics. So if you want you can look at this website and it can convert your birthday or any day of any time into the Mayan combinations and you can read about your Mayan astrology.  Okay.  so good everybody for a lot of people have said see this is  You know kind of an intuitive rule that everybody used and it's it's it's a it's a common rule that we use all the time maybe without even thinking about it. But in this class we're going to name. It is called the product rule. Basically what you just did was you enumerated the cross product of the name days and the number days, right? And we learned in CFC 20 that the cardinality of the cross product is the product of the cardinalities, right?  So if you guys don't remember what the cross product is remember, its do you have two sets A and B the cross product is all the different combinations where the first?  Entry is from the second entry is from B.  any questions  pretty simple, right?  Okay, this is another way to kind of think about it to count the number of pairs of objects. You count the number of First objects. And then for each one of those you count the number of second object, so that's why you multiply them together. There is a little bit of a caution. This is only work if the number of choices for the second object does not depend on the first object we choose so  It works for this example, but not always.  Okay.  So you may be wondering.  here  Where in the world does 260 come from that doesn't have anything to do with the number of days in a year this was this was more of like the religious calendar. And so the days these days weren't really associated with the seasons. They were more religious ceremonies and stuff like that. So, you know just to kind of give you a sense that they they knew about 365 days of the calendar year.  And in fact, they had this this great system of sort of like gears where this this big gear is The Big Year of 365 days in a year, and then you have your 20 named days and your 13 number days.  And they all kind of mesh together.  So the agricultural calendar was called called the Hub and had 365 days. Just like we know it today.  Is agricultural because it's like, you know, it keeps track of the seasons and stuff like that.  And so you can kind of think about it in that way.  Okay, so  just sort of like some historical context. Okay next thing.  The salkin in the hob. Those were the two things that we just looked at. Those are only part of the calendar the rest of the calendar talked about years that have passed and  And they had this system of calculating how long it has been since the first day the day of their religious creation. And so this right here is a date and this tells you how many days have passed since the mythical creation of the Mayans. Okay. So how do you do it again is called is is one day in case that's fine. You ain't all is 20 kin a tune is 18 you and all a cartoon 22 and a baktun is 20 cartoon. So my question to you is how many days are in one baktun?  Can you can kind of use the the product rule again to do this, right?  so we have  a baktun  Is 20 cartoon?  Right, which is 20 times.  A cartoon is 20 tune.  Which is 20 * 20 * a tune is 18 Yuan all.  Is equal to 20?  * 20 * 18 and a un tall is 20 Kent.  Right, and so you multiply all these together to get 20 * 20 * 18 * 20, which is days.  So you got a hundred and forty four thousand.  days  How many years is that?  a lot like  500 or something?  400 500 something like that.  That's so just to give you a little bit of context.  This guy is the baktun. Okay, and how do you read this? This is a number. This is 13. So each line is 5 so you have five when the calendar turned from 12 box tune to 13 baktun. That's the 2012 thing then so that's when it all happened. And so now we're in the thirteenth baktun and I don't know nothing happened. So I guess everybody's okay.  Dayton and all these all these other things are the other dates.  Okay. So today April April 2nd 2019 is this is the date right in this is how they would this how they would represent right?  13 sex  So, I don't know if I update it back how many days have elapsed well.  You can do maybe you can do this as an exercise.  You can figure out that the mythical creation day was around 3100 BC.  I don't know what happened on there, but that's what this.  Okay. Now let's kind of change gears with the Sulkin and the hob calendars. There's 20 names symbols. And there's 19 month symbols. Okay.  How many symbols total are there?  song  I know this is not really supposed to be a trick question. Okay?  Most people say 39 good. How did you get that?  You added them right another very simple counting technique that is very intuitive and everybody knows it. But let's give it a name. It's called the  some rule  Where is it?  Okay, and this goes back to CSE 20 which we talked about it before if you have two disjoint sets A and B. Then there thus the color cardinality of their Union is the sum of their cardinalities.  And I don't know. I don't know how much more I can say about that.  Start another thing you can think about when we're talkin about algorithms or doing different tasks. If a task can be done in either and one ways or and two ways were none of the N1 ways has the same as any of the in two ways in there and one person two ways to do the task.  Or what we're going to mainly use the sum rule for is sort of backwards we're going to do is start with a big set and break it up into two disjoint sets count each one of those individually and then combine them back together.  Okay, let's do a few more exercises.  Okay.  So let's say you're playing a video game and you need to make your avatar.  And let's say that you only get 12 hairstyles and 8 hair colors, but everything else is fixed.  How many different characters are possible?  OK Google  product rule  Okay.  How about this one? There are 96 possible custom characters a player can also choose one of 10, maybe like celebrity characters. How many characters are there here?  Okay, good. This one is what some rule.  Any questions about that?  Okay good.  Okay. So those are fun things to count. One of my favorite things to count is binary strings.  Are lynx and binary string is a string of length n that's composed of zeros and ones only.  How many links and binary strings are there total?  Can we talk about this in 2010?  Okay, good. Now how do we get that? Well, let's think about a few different techniques on how to count thing.  Okay.  One way to do it one way to get started If you're sort of stuck is to just start counting smaller subset or smaller instances, right? So, how many is the number of length and binary strings? How many legs do all binary strings are there?  0 or 1  1 write the empty string  I know we talked about that at 20.  Okay, how many lengths 1 binary strings are there?  2  0 + 1 how many are there?  And what about 3?  Hey, right, okay. So if you do that, you can maybe I mean we all kind of knew the answer already. But if you didn't or if it was a hardware problem, you could do this and maybe start seeing a pattern and then once you find a pattern you could prove that the pattern works.  Another way to do it is to use the product rule or the sum rule, which one of those rules Works in this case.  Okay good.  Okay, good song.  Maybe  have a few different viewpoints here.  Let's look at the product rule in the sun Rule and how you can use them to count the number of binary strings.  Okay, the product rule first.  Now when we first looked at the product will we only did it with two sets? Right, but now we're going to do it with n sets right. The idea here is you can list out your different positions, right?  Let's say we're doing a 8 v string.  How many possibilities do I have for the first position?  to write two possibilities * 2 * 2 * 2  * 2 * 2  2 to the 8th  And remember we talked about the product rule and having something to do with the Cartesian product. How does this actually work work with the Cartesian product? How does that translate? Essentially? What you're doing is you're taking the cross product of the set 01.  That's fine.  Will it sell?  power many times  How many did I do?  What's 55 what does a typical element of this look like?  Something like this, right 01101 or something like that. It has one member from the second set one member from the Thursday and this is just a binary string. So if you want to come with all of them the whole cardinality of this thing is kind of how it might relate to that any question.  Okay, how we going to use the sum rule? This is where it gets kind of weird kind of going to turn the sum rule around.  Okay, instead of instead of counting it all at once. We can split up the whole set into two disjoint subsets. Okay?  One very natural way to split up the set of binary strings if the split it up depending on what it starts with right all the ones that start with zero with all the ones that start with one.  start with 0  start with one  Are these two sets disjoint?  Yes, right. You can't start with both a zero and a one so that means that if I can count both of those then I can add them together to get the full set.  right  So how many let's say we were talking about length and binary strings?  Let's abs of end.  Is number of length?  and binary strings  So how many strings start with 0?  0 and then the rest of the bits can be whatever they want. Right how many how many different position how many remaining positions are there?  + -1  and what about that start with one?  Also be there in -1.  So now what we have is B of 0 is 1 and B of n is 2 G of N - 1 - 1 + B of A 2-1. So here we haven't really counted it. We don't have a closed form. But we have what we do have is a recurrence relation, which is almost as good with a recurrence relation were able to generate the sequence by using that rule over and over again one is 2 * 1 which is to be of 2 is 2 * 2 which is for and so on.  Okay. So this is one way to kind of use the sum rule kind of backwards.  Remember this way of splitting it up cuz it's going to come in come in to play again where we split up binary strings by their first day.  Can any other questions?  Okay.  I guess I went like super fast compared to Quang.  and  I guess maybe we should.  Start on the next thing.  Yeah.  No.  Let me just see here.  You guys counted so fast.  We did login, right?  All right. Yeah, maybe we just call it a day. What do you say?  Okay, so  Kwong is going to substitute for me next class. So he'll start exactly where where we need to be.  Tell me about my midterm situation where I have to buy. "
