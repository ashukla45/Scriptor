    "Full Transcript": "Is why we want to use this rule to cow the cardinality of Cartesian products and the example that we show you last time. Is it in counting the number of days in a Mayan calendar? Because if you look at a day in the calendar that you can say that was a day has to have two components are number and while a name of the day in the previous example, we showed you last time while I have 20 possible names for my days and I have 13 bus phone numbers. So if I want to look at while what are all the configuration so I can have for a day in the calendar. I just had to take the car headed cardinality of this most pie with the car. So this is the product rule at the same time. We also have the sunroof and a sunroof is you when you want to compute the cardinality of disjoint subsets. Open Union stop discharge subset. So in this example, I have I have two different type of system the one with 20 days and another one with 19 days and these are two different system. So there is no overlap between those two calendar. And now if I want to see how many days there are in total then what I'm doing is I want to computer cardinality of this Union and because my system are different.  These two set a destroyed so I can just get up there cardinality to have while 20 + 19. + you can also expand this room to do to deal with the cardinality of the Union's off say and set and the only condition that you have to worry about is that those set those guys in here aa1828 and they have to be pairwise disjoint and buy pear where to start. I mean if you look at the intersection between any two of those and guys while the intersection has to be an empty set. If you have a collection up and pair Wireless Toyz set then we can easily computer unions the union onf them simply by acting up the individual colonies.  And this example this is the last example that we look at while on Tuesday. We want to count the number of binary string of length and binary string can only have zero one four digit and we can use both the Photo Pro if I just have to tell one bit at a time. I want to look at the binary string of length in so I will have invitations like this.  And positions and for which position what can I put in there? I can put it a zero or one so I have two choice to choice and so on so I will have to to the end different charges according to the product rule and at the same time I can also use a sum rule to pick out this problem. So, how do I find how do I use a sunroof? I want to take the set off binary string of length n  And I'm going to break this guy into ha.  These are going to be the strongest I-10 the other one going to be the strings that start with one so you can say that well because they are different than these two will have to be while destroyed today's no overlapping between these two have and if I can call the community of each other half then I should be able to just eat them up and get the power on so that I'm looking for right if I can can have this cow and what are the cow for these guys? Well, I can look at the record some Thai formula like this because if I let and off ask to be the number of string  length s  then in order to know the cardinality of say this happen here and Brazil. Look, I'm looking at the number Pi to restring applying + -1 and what are those guy by this end of and -1 into I'll do the same thing for this so I can end up attending some Capricorn sun to prove if I have the recurring like that. Then the final answer I should have you have to be to to the end which is the same as a final answer. I obtained from the product rule.  Trent and of course later in this class, we will also show you how we can have two sole a recurring a linear recurrence in in a general case.  Let's look at something new.  Then I'll be want to talk about ice cream. So so supposed to buy ice cream. And now I have three option for the container. I can put it I can put the scoop in in in about how I can put in a cone or I can put this in a sugar cone. So let's make this thing fancy Google call rent. So the first question I want to ask myself as well. How many way I can how many possible configuration of how many possible creation that I can make you think this is easy? Just tell me what you think.  60 why do you have six day?  Yes, so 60 and here we going to have 60. Yes, because this is 3 * 20 y 3 y 20 I have three choices for the container.  All the cones and I have 20 different flavor.  And this is the product rule.  I pick a flavor. I picked a container and that I most by those together.  Now, it's your turn. Now we have are slightly more complicated problem.  Supposed now I'm selling ice cream uses a fire me. So I'm selling ice cream and  And while I have to type of customer The Pour one for only one the the regular ice cream that we have in here. So this is what poor people eat and the rich I have Rich customer who wanted to convert their ice cream into a Sunday and what's going on with a Sunday. Well, so if you buy a Sunday, then you get only option from the song from Wild from the pool people choice, but now you get to upgrade with a charge up a source you get to decide whether you want to put whipped cream on top or not. You get to decide where you want to put cherry on top or not.  Okay, so you have two choices for the sauce to get to decide. What a whip cream or cherry?  No, I want you to tell me why how how many possible configurations are we can have?  So let's take one minute talk to your neighbor and then I'll talk to tutors as well and tell me what you think.  I'm doing and I put in clip in hair after using frequency CIA.  Oh, yeah.  Why are we good? Are we good now? And then let's look at the answer. So make sure to click and I'm using the frequency. CA didn't have time to change. So please play Spotify as your frequency.  All right 3.  1  I'm going to a different frequency CA so you're so so please please change that.  Okay, so, let's see what we have.  Alright, so we have a split between C and D. So they are 36% compared to 43 and then the rest we just a B&E. Okay. So which one is the correct answer? I see. Like I said, I have to the poor and the rich people.  Right. So how many way can I make an ice cream to set up the pool people? I will have 20 flavors three container, which is going to be 60.  So what about the rich and fancy people while I'm selling this guy over price Sunday?  And how can I make my Sunday? I still have 20 flavors.  I still have three container.  I still have now I have two titles sauces.  And then what's next?  Okay, so this is the difference between C and D.  So depending on how you count the whipped cream how you care with the Cherry that you going to eat an end up with c o d in this setup. You get the option that you want to act with cream or not. So there are two option for the whipped cream.  Are not and that will be to audition for the Cherry.  or not  So the number of Sunday configuration that we will have will be 20 * 3 * 2 * 2 + * 2 again.  And finally According to some bro. I'll just have to act this guy and this guy in order to end up with this guy.  You have to let them guess According to some rule because look we shouldn't we shouldn't forget about these these poor people right? I still have to sell ice cream to them. So that's why I have to have a cow.  I know that's right something slightly harder.  No sew for this example. So we're still using product with some rope for this example. I have while I have 26 letters the regular English alphabet. I have pie vowels and 21 consonant and in here, I'm trying to build a four-letter string.  That has one vowel and three consonant. So in here the string doesn't have to be a word doesn't have to make sense. For example, I can have a swing like this.  And this is too far right doesn't have there's no work like this in English. No string like this and this still power what I want to do. Now. I want you to text about how about it will take 2 minutes. I want you to talk to your neighbor and tell me how many way you can build a Fallout of string with one vowel and three consonant and now I want you to do one extra thing beside identifying the correct answer. I want you to explain to your neighbor why the other answer was incorrect tell me the correct one then explain why the others are incorrect.  So let's take 2 minutes.  Yes, I don't put any restrictions to do whatever you want, right?  All right. Let's start a towel.  3  1  okay, so the majority of the update respond B and C. So 30% compared to 67% and then the rest will just be a d and e  What cannot be the correct answer in here?  So let's look at a is it correct or not?  Why not?  Guess what? I'm doing in a place like I'm just I just pick one vowel and one consonant.  And one bottle and that's it. I'm not saying anything about building the War. I don't even I don't even mention while the four letter word. The next list answer is if so, what's wrong with it?  So what are we what are we trying to do in in in a what do you think?  Yes, so what I'm doing in here is actually the 26th or 4th. Basically is the number of  four-letter string  and what about 21 to the 4th? So I'm subtracting from these guys the number for letter string.  That our own continent.  So what do I have left? I will have these guy when I subtract them by sleigh. I will have this is the number of strings.  with  At least one vowel.  And this is not quite what I want. I want that exactly one vowel at least one bottle is not good enough.  But this guy's out still good.  What about D what's wrong with d?  Yeah, and that is not what we want, right because I actually allow something like this.  I think so if I don't say anything like what you have to do on this day.  Know if you have to ask so if I don't say anything then you have to ask on the exam on the exam. If I don't say anything that you have to ask while so in here, I allow duplicate. I allowed to read the reviews for the consonant. So in here while  the car consonant  And this is not what we want wait wait, wait wait, we are allowed to we can reuse this thing something like this.  Now what about being see? So what is the difference between B and C. Well, if you look at me and see you can say that the only difference between them is a far in front. So the answer is C bracelet at four times the on Sunday.  So what is going on between those two?  Yes, so the different in here between B and C. Let me use a different colors.  The difference between B and C is the fall and this fall in here by slate count.  Costco  pause.  Fall the Bible  so which one is the correct answer the  so what?  So what does c have Envy doesn't see Ashley while considering possible place? I can place my Powers because I can place about the first second third or the last position where the speed right B only consider this one case in here.  I said this this one case in here. This is only in b  Where's the answer in C?  Is what's going to give me the right answer?  Are we good?  so any questions  Okay, so let's look at another example.  So in this example, we look at while the number of people who know Java we look at the number of people who know see and then I want to ask myself how how many people know Java or C. Maybe both age me to set up people who know Java need to be the set of people who know see then this statement in here is basically asking me to look at the union between a and b  And when I asked myself well how many elements how many people are in this that I'm basically looking at the cardinality of this Union?  So how do I find the cardinality of this Union well?  Basically, I want to buy the number of elements are in this region.  So the good starting point, which is me while I want to know the people number of people who know either Java or C. So let's just hope the number of people who know Java into my account so I will have this written in  all right, and then I would just do this the number of people who don't see  and now I'm seeing a problem. What is the problem if you are in the intersection or if you are one of the few talented people who know both Java and C are in a case of people who passed balls what 11 and 12?  I don't know like  beta Chi O C plus plus 100.  July 1st. Did you sleep Lafleur?  Yes, could you pour Rice play the people in here are the folks who passed both of those passes and we have to count those guys in here knowing we have to remove those guy. Why is that because when you add these two numbers you have no cows each and every one of the people who know both languages while I just have to remove for Mike how the number of people who Noble  And what is the formula for this? Well, if I want to find the cardinality of a union B, then I'm going to stop by adding the cardinality of A and B.  And then I will adjust for the book counting by removing the cardinality of the intersection.  All right.  So this is what we call inclusion exclusion. And this is the easiest queso inclusion-exclusion where we only have while two sets.  So the reason the sum rule is not enough in here simply because while we don't know that the two set A and B are disjoint or not. Some room can only be a fly. If so y'all to set a destroyed so I can hear the to set my oven not be destroyed. So we have to adjust for double counting by removing this guy by removing the elements that belong to boss that  So can we make this thing even for even harder than the answer is? Yes, what if we have preset and we want to compare the cardinality of the Union of a b and c.  What are we going to do?  So basically what I want to compute is the number element inside shaded regions in here.  Well, just stop by adding to this the cardinality of a so I have that Circle.  Is it I'm going to add to this the Cardinals help me. I know what I'm making a mistake in here, but I'm just going to leave that for the end and the Mystic and his disguises.  What time does why I'm going to just start at the end and then I want to add to this the cardinality of C.  So now what happened at this point?  the Dyson hair on Celtic ones  So they're all good guys in here is a different color.  price  these guys are on top price.  And what else well the guys in the middle the people who who belongs to own preset these guys a cabin price or three times?  So I will have a couple of adjustment to make in here. So what is the first adjustment adjustment I can do while I'm just going to remove the intersection of A and B.  so now these guys account twice twice and twice  sarna remove PNC intersection of dnce  So now this piece in here is the only place that is called quest everyone everywhere else is fine.  Okay.  And then finally, I'm going to remove the intersection between a and C.  Are we good?  No, we are not get in here. What is the issue?  Yep. I lost all my guys in the middle.  So how do I fix that while I was just at those guys back in?  Pranks that are easy.  Let me this is easy. Right? Just wait until you see the next fly. Well this this this is like nothing compared to the next one.  Okay.  So this is the formula for inclusion exclusion when we have preset and this is  Obviously, this is what we going to ask you on the exams. I mean I can tell you for sure. I want to ask we going to ask you this about this for me on the exam but whether or not you can recognize the formula, that's a different story. We going to ask you this thing. That's for sure. So make sure it's to study this put some some some star awesome symbol in here.  So this mean denture?  This is something we definitely going to ask you on the exam. And this is how you do in inclusive explosion for 3 set and in case you are wondering what it's going to look like when we have more than three. So here's a formula.  The idea is pretty much the same you going to act all the Singleton.  And in here by Singleton, I mean while the cardinality of the single set you want to subtract the duck boss.  Play say you want to subtract whole candidacies of whole intersections between to set up the triple stack in.  And so on subtract and subtract, that's how we say inclusion.  Fall the addition and then exclusion is When You Subtract one homework problem that requires you to use this formula. And then once you figure out that have a problem while you're good with the general formula. Oh you should focus on which is a two and three set potato two and three set.  Are we good?  No, let's look at some examples in here.  So I want to tell the number of binary string of length n that start with one or and with zero.  and of course I had to use inclusion-exclusion to the first thing I have to figure out is how to setup inclusion exclusion how to convert what we want to count in here into a problem of fighting credit card identity of unions of set  So what I want to do is I want to look at I want to call this. I want to let a be the set is going to be the set of  So I'm left me lazy and say wow instead of saying binary binary string of life, and I'm just going to shorthand this guy to end stream and I want to talk to Santa and string Best Buy with one.  So the element in a bracelet will have to look something like this.  I have to stop at 1 and then I have to decide what to do for the remaining and -1 spots.  I want to let me to be the set of and strings.  And with the Pizarro.  So basically an element in be it's going to look something like this.  Where I have to figure out what to put in the first and -2 spot.  We all good.  So, can you tell me what is a what the cardinality of a is?  2 to the N - 1 good  what is a cardinality of B?  2 to the N - 2  All right, and what do we need next in order to do inclusion exclusion?  I'm going to have to look at a  intersect B  Well, let's go back to the formula or to set.  So this is what I want to cow.  diesel  All right.  So yeah, let me put it in here what we want to call spicely a union B, so I'm going to need all three of this.  Okay, so  What is an element in here in a insect is going to look like?  So you going to stop from 1?  Stop at 1 and then you going to end what's the Pizarro? So how many free spaces that you have?  So what is a scientist set?  2 to the N - 3 so what is a final answer that we have?  2 to the N - 1 + 2 to the N - 2 these are the coordinates of the Singleton and -3 which is the cardinality of the Depo.  right  so good.  questions  Of course, we're going to try something harder.  Now I want to look at the number of 6 digit string.  I'm so first of all, let me distinguish between a string and a number. So a string bracelet can start with 0.  So if I look something like this 011-2755 Dennis is okay. If you look at this guy in terms of number that this is not a number with 6 digits practice only has 5 digit as a number. But what does a string this is fine? All right, and we want to know how many 6 string and while we are talking about that's moving here so that it can be 0 1 2 3 of tonight. I want to start with either an even number or I want to end with a zero all I just want to use the beaches that are less than 5 and in here this means zero one, two, three four.  So, let's see if we can figure out this thing.  Well, I want to let this to be a b and c.  And because we're talking about all in here, so my sweat I want to fly.  So I I want to fly.  the cardinality of a union B Union C  And well the first thing I'm going to need.  Let's start with The Singletons.  So, how do I count the sky?  So far as I know that my string has to start with an even number.  And I have six.  places  So how many choices how many string can I construct?  So this is product rule. I have any choice five right? I have five charges to pick the even number.  02302 for 6 a.m.  I have 10 choices for each of the remaining bit because once I have the even number that is no more restriction.  Is it?  Sodikoff in here is going to be 5 x 10 to the 5th power.  All right.  Are we good?  What about B?  I am 0 so what what do I have 10 to the 5th, silly because I have 10 charges.  For each of the first five bits and finally 4C. I will have 5 to the 6 power.  Like why is that flies 5 to the 6 power?  Because now I only have 5 charges.  For each of these guys and now I have I have to make six I have to have two two six position.  navigate  August Studio easy Park  Alright, so let's move on.  What else do I have to come pay with? I need to look at the car identity of a intersect b b in the SEC C & C in the set a  And I have same time. I also have two computer cardinality up a in the SEC be in the sexy.  So, how are you going to fight these guys?  So a intersect B this mean my string has to start with an even number.  And he has to end with a 0.  So how many choices do I have for this?  5 *  5 * 10 to the 4  begin the sexy this mean my string has two and with a zero.  Right, and I can only use 02 fall.  in here  So what do I have?  5 to the 5th  and see in the set a  It's going to be what it's going to be 3 * 5 to the 5th because I want the first bit to be even and then all the other 5 it they can only be 0 to 4.  OK Google  Can you give me the last number?  3 * 5 to the fall. I want to be even I want the last between 0 and I want old middle for can either be 0 or fall.  So how much do I have?  I'm sorry 0 to 4.  And not just in the middle for all the first five heartbeats 0 to 4. So, how much do I have I have three y302 and fall.  For the middle one. I want to have five.  * 5 * 5 * 5 and finally out just have one.  Okay. So now we have all the ingredients. We need to finish this problem.  And this will be your home with us tonight to put these together.  Okay.  Still good.  Well, let's try another problem.  No, I know. I want to look at the number of four digit string.  That has at least one zero.  No, I want you to take 2 minutes about 2 or 3 minutes. Talk to your neighbor and I want you to do these two things for me.  Identify the correct answers that will be more than one correct answers.  Next I want you to tell me what's wrong with the with the with the incorrect one. So just like before give me the correct answer and explain to me why the other answers are incorrect. But now that will be multiple car cancer.  Okay, so let's take 3 minutes for you to figure this out.  All right, let's start a countdown and then we'll look at the answers.  SO3  1  Celeste  okay, so I mean, I'm very happy you are my best to identify the obvious correct answer which is be  What's wrong with this baby? This is the obvious correct answer and at the same time you you also be able to identify the incorrect answers. Which r a n d.  because only 2% of you pick a and 2% pick d  So what's wrong with A&D?  So what are we trying to tell in a and indy?  Come on. Why did you pick and  1 what?  Good and what's the difference between AMD?  Yes, so different at 10 a.m. DEC days. Exactly one zero.  And this guy is fixed 0.  These are not what we want to cow.  And if you look at the next life, I mean by saying you read this thing before coming to class then you're going to CBS a correct answer and now let's do something else. So between C and D. I want to say that one of them and exactly one of them is going to be the correct answer. So that's castelnuovo.  Only see and tell me which one is correct. That's a 10 second.  Tell me between c and e which one is correct?  Exactly. One of those is going to be correct.  All the phone numbers are correct.  okay, so just pixie and he only  I don't care about be anymore. So I don't choose to be.  Okay, so  so it's a 75/25 split between 75 saying seize. The correct answer is the auto correct answer and 25 c e is now in here the auto correct answer is C.  So why is that? So what I'm doing in here is  let's look at the set of 4 digits string.  with  Atlas  1 0  so what I'm doing and see if I break this set into for the Stars upset right where I can only have exactly one.  10 exactly  2030  and fall zeros  Okay.  And now you're going to ask me well, so this is obvious.  This is all so easy to say if I want to have exactly 40 or I would have one by 000.  And and now you going to ask me or at least I hope that you going to ask me what what's the deal with this guy?  Yeah, what's up with them?  So what what what is this following in here?  So what am i counting in the fall?  the location of  the location of a nonzero guy the location of a nonzero guy. And then which one is the which number is 0 get me the location then put the number in there.  Alright, what's what's up with this sticks in here?  SoDo squid the location of zeros on a 2-0. So why six?  Well in here the six actually, both of them because I only have four digit for phone numbers. So if I know where the zero hour and the other one will have to be done on 06. What why do we have sex while because I can have I guess.  Yes, and those going to be 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 and 3/4 locations where I can put 0 or if you want I can put the right to see is the auto correct answer.  So what's wrong with it?  Okay, so I'll 25% if you say it's going to be and I'm no psychic but let me try to guess what what what you what you think in this case. So when you pick which is 4 x 10 to the tub, I'm going to assume that you going to say wow. I'm just going to choose the location.  fall the zero  best apple locations now, I don't need any more respect than right because I need a plus-10. So that is my 02 now. The rest can be  Can be anything?  No restriction, I already fulfilled the One requirement that I need which is I have to have at least one zero. So now for the rest for the total remaining free places, I can just put any number from 0 to 9 in here. Is it is it what what you think?  Again, I'm no psychic psychic, but that's what I would guess. So now this is this is a very common mister.  So if you if you make this mistake, maybe that is good because now you're going to do not going to make the same mistake on Excel.  I'm just like with my class in the morning. I asked people to go to Piazza and I want everyone to discuss the following thing. I claim that this number in here.  What's the Polk County?  So if you follow this better than this number 0 2 0 5 has been count twice. So I want you to go to psi and then discuss our share your reason with with with other people.  So if you actually make this mistake while that's going to be a good thing because you're not going to make the same thing on the excitement amor.  So yeah, please go to Fiesta and share what you what you have explain why this is double Counting.  Okay, and finally fall be this is a reason being is the correct answer. I take all the cases which are going to be 10 to the 4th. And then I subtract hour from here. These are the back cases.  And these guys are nice to the fall.  Crack, so whatever remaining here while we have to be the good cases.  I saw I take all the cases subtract the bad cases to have a good case.  And while my favorite quote from sell of home that is where he says when you have eliminated the impossible.  Whatever remains however, improbable has to be the truth. Should you remove all the back cases than the one remain will have to be the good but now how are we going to remove any possible that's going to be hard but this is what we're doing and if you want a verbal description than this is how old is Casey's  Subtract the bad cases and whatever you say the word, please this is what we going to do.  No, I want you to take this and this will be your homework for tonight.  Alright, so I want you to do this. And of course share. I mean I say, this is homework, but this is okay to share your answer on PS4 this problem by so try to think about this problem what you have on PSI with other people and also once you finish this  You want to look at the real homework assignment and you're going to use this idea to Cal the path in homework assignment. So maybe I should look at the hobo Simon. Then you should have some idea what I'm talking about. You got to do some pot scouting using this. I didn't hear.  All right.  Are we good?  Pasco County  so this is one of the homework problems for next week.  I'm not going to buy anything for the  but yeah, that's the only problem with path.  Okay. So are we good with the previous problem?  All right. So let's look at  a new tile problem  And now this is what we call a scheduling problem.  Saudi ID in here is while I have four jobs that I have to finish. I know that these drop will take a different amount of time, but I just don't know exactly how long it took them is going to take so I can finish the finishing order that we can have.  So let this one is easy. Let's take 30 second for you to vote on this.  This is going to be very easy. Just a second.  Alright we got.  3  2  1  so the majority of you say this going to be e s i d which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 right? Well, I have four different locations of a far different job to finish and I going to have for charges for this.  And once I make my charge for the first job to finish I can no longer to reuse that choice for her for the future one. So now I only have three I only have two and one in the future. So this is an application of the product rule.  And it is important to to see in here. We're using the product rule and the Restriction of the prodigal. Say wow.  The previous charges must not affect the number option that I will have for the future. So whatever I pick for the previous Joy is not going to change. The number of the of the auction itself will be chaired. But the number of options will be will remain the same ones. I picked one of the job that's a big J to be the first one. I want to finish then I can only use k103 Akshay for for the second job for a second position did the nature of a different but the number of them wisely. I have three I still have three no matter what your eyes I pick for the first job. I still have three possibilities for a second so I can hear the options remain the same. So that's why we are allowed to use while  I'm Prada crew and this problem can also be explained in to wow when we want to talk about the different way to rearrange a set of listing of check.  So they have to work. I want you to pay attention in this case the first one being order while ordering or order the second one this thing.  Saudi tattoo in Poland War  that you want to take home for tonight.  order in Destiny  So, what are we doing?  Well, let's say we have a swimming race weather as a swimmer.  right, so  going to say wow, that will be  so how do I decide a finishing order for these eight guys have eight ways to pick the winner seven ways to pick the second place 6 for the for the third and so on.  Flattest, right. So in theory if everyone has the same chance of winning then this is going to be the number of way. I can pick a finishing order things are going to get a little bit different because when you pick Michael files again some amateur screamer and obviously foul is going to take one of the top three even the gold medal as well. So that will be more restriction placed on this problem. But in theory, it is a number that we have.  When I want to decide wow, how many way I can decide you're sitting for the for the exam. What I'm going to do is I'm going to itch up a chair and then pick a person to put into that chair right once I choose you want to choose a post. I cannot reuse that person for the next year. So the number will get decreasing say we have how many we have we have 130 spouse who won 29 and something until I threw up on a chair.  And of course, this is the number where I can rearrange the cars in the back 50 51 52 5150 down to 2 and 1/2 of the top II Cut & Sew.  And this is the idea of what we call and permutation.  So a permutation like I say is a number is a permutation is a rearrangement or an ordering of n distinct objects. So once again all the ring and Destiny  So I'm trying to order my things and the objects that I have our own different. Those are the two important work from here. And then in general if you have an ID, you have an object and distinct object. Then this is going to be the number of ways to rearrange them. Well item 2nd 3rd 4th and Sable.  And by convention, I want to say wow. If I don't have anything then I have one way to rearrange nothing which is by doing nothing. I'm doing nothing means you're doing something right. Make no sense at all.  Okay.  snowdaes another variation for permutations, which we call our publication  So what's the difference between a permutation and a regular permutation? I only care about ordering of our objects. I only care about the ordering.  I was off in this thing.  objects  And once again those two worlds are there order and Destiny?  So instead of rearranging my entire collection. I just want to rearrange a southern portion of my collection are out and  And this is what we call an hour permutation. So you can say wow instead of rearrange Order season. I have I'm just going to First Watch acai one of you to be the class president want you to be the vice president or not. I want to see the treasury and so on. I was outside the role for 5-hour 100 student that we have.  I have a race with 10 people, but I can only acai three medals. So this is the 3 permutation of a set of 10 different people.  And in general the number of all permutation of an object is going to be given by.  This product in here. So that's kind of like a pictorial life product. At some point. We're not going to go all the way to 21. We going to stop at some point.  I so let's look at an example of what Adventure is coming up in a couple weeks, right? So let's talk about superheroes.  So let's say I have and Marvel superheroes.  And I want to look at the number of way.  2-ranked  my top 5  locate so I mention this thing.  Where is the world order?  It's in here.  So did the work order is in here?  So when you rang you're the top five superheroes by say you are putting them in order and I want to assume that all the Marvel superheroes are different. There is no self play the region between the heroes.  So, how are we going to do this? So how many times did you have off for your favorite?  You going to have any charges for a 44-40 for your favorite + - 1 + - 2 + - 3 + n + -4 and then I stopped because after the 5th position I don't care about the rest of those lame Heroes anymore.  What's up with the fall? This far is going to be in -5 + 1/5.  Is the weather for Arlington?  And well, by the way for me this is tall.  This is Doctor strain.  And this is Black Panther.  But I mean if you just have to love tall is Chris Hemsworth.  Are we still good?  and of course  So what's wrong with what's wrong with her?  Oh boy.  I mean, I can't believe you asked where Superman.  So, please please don't go to Comic-Con.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so please don't go to Comic-Con and ask where Superman in the Marvel roster.  Iron Man I don't I don't really like Iron Man and Spider-Man is light at the bottom.  All right. Yeah.  Okay, so  No, that's not a couple of different problems in here.  And this is going to be this is going to be end up a really famous problem out there.  So I want to visit those Seven Cities and I want to visit each of them exactly once and I have to go to all seven of them. So, can you tell me how many ways can I rearrange? Can I arrange my trip? Can I plan my trip?  7 c d exactly one  I want to have seven factorial way to plan the trip because what I'm doing here is I'm just trying to rearrange a correction up seven different objects.  Still good.  What about the case where I want why I only have enough money to visit five of them and I want to visit them exactly once.  So, let's see what we have in here. So I will get to go to five cities.  I want to have seven choices for the first six for the second five four and then three.  So according to the product rule the number of way I can plan my trip is going to be 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3  and this is going to be seven factorial / 7 - 5 factorial.  I'm missing two in one why am I missing two in one? Because I'm I just divided by 2 factorial.  So what am I doing here? I'm renting 5 out of 7 objects and ranked in the top five seven.  No suppose. I have to start a New York and I have to end in Seattle.  So how many ways can I plan my trip now visit it's today exactly one.  5 factorial  Why is that because if I start a New York and if I end in sad Seattle and those guys are removed from from for my list, so now my job is just to rearrange the video five.  It's going to get harder and harder it's time.  Star from New York and in Seattle visit each and every city exactly once but I have to go to LA in minute Lee after San Diego.  So what are you going to do? Just take one minute talk to your neighbor and then share with me what you think?  Alright, are we good?  help  Okay, so  Are we good?  So anyone want to share with me? Well what the first one what what is it that you think?  Yes, that's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to consider our way in San Diego last one big city. That's a I go to I arrive at the San Diego airport and I leave at the end. So. Just one big city. So now I only have while for CDs.  City Pipe Rock this guy into one city then now it would have falsity and that's going to be for factorio.  Because if you don't do this then what you going to do is while you may want to if you give you a trying to tell this to to compliment and that's going to get really annoying.  So this is likely the fastest way that that that weed that I know to do this.  Oh, yes, that's fine as well. Yes.  Yes, that's why I swell right so I'm just attended a group the two into one big sea day. Are you going to say wow, if I go it's time to go then obviously, I have to leave in a way. I have to leave from LA to remove La put it in and put it in the same city as San Diego. Nobody cares why I always right.  Now this is why we do want to care about La. So send set up stuff from New York and in Seattle.  And I have to visit LA and San Diego immediately after each other.  So what are we going to do?  So yeah, so what I'm going to do is yes, I'm going to block these guys into one city. So now I will just have for CD.  Which wouldn't give me four facts our ways to plan the trip.  But then here's the catch.  You can either go to Hawaii first then San Diego or you can go to San Diego 1st and Highway.  right choice  in the fall factorio now gives me  two cases  so the total number that I have  Is it going to be 2 x 4?  Take an answer for the previous Park. And now if you swap the auto between LA and San Diego you going to end up with a different configuration?  So in general this is the really famous problem. We call this a traveling Salman and the idea is the guy want to visit each and every CD to sell his product exactly once and he also want to do that while he may also want to minimize the cost right because it's make no sense. If you are either in San Diego going to fly all the way to New York and then fly back to LA. So you want to plan your trip in the weather can minimize the cost the airplane the gas or whatever cost of your pay and one way we can do this is we going to look at Matrix and the way we read this Matrix is the following that just say  It's snowing here. It's going to be the car to me anytime cost going from Chicago to New York from Chicago and so on. So every time you make a trip, then you just have to add the cost to fly to the total number and you want to minimize that sub and this problem is extremely hard that mean it's not in the sense that we don't know what to do. We do know what to do. But the problem is we don't like the answer that we have.  Simply. Wow, in this case one way we can do is well, I'm just going to exhaust all the first possible way. I can travel between the cities.  And then which of the seven dwarfs I'm just going to computer course wedding cost and then choose the plan that will give me the the lowest number. If you up smart, then you can actually reduce the number of Paces down a little bit. Say in this case. If you end up in San Diego, then you're going to say that it might end up in San Diego that allow the most obvious choice to do next is going to go to the other city. I so you can somehow reduce the number of cases that you have to text.  How many CDs do we have in the world?  1902 to 2 to look at a hundred thousand. So this problem has a solution by Brute Force, but we just don't like the solution because it's going to take a long time.  Right now, let's go back to ice cream again.  Weight supposed to be good with this phone. I was just saying about this at the very heart problem. You going to say this again in CSS? 101?  Okay. So now let's go back to ice cream again and let you say today is a Payday and I have enough money to buy two scoop of ice cream.  Yeah, I know. They don't UCSD doesn't pay me much.  So I have to scoop now. I can put by to scoop ice cream and let's just say I'm a really picky eater. I want the top to be different for the bottom. So I want the flavor. I want two different flavor and for me the order does matter.  Because water on top is going to be the one that you eat first, right? So depending on what type of people you are. You want to eat your favorite thing first, or you want to save that for last night stands, right? I hope so in here how many ways I can buy the ice cream if I have if they have an flavors.  So I have any charges for the top and then have and -1 charges for the farm. So in total.  I'm going to have an x + -1.  All right.  This is what happened when I differentiate the order. So this is Wendy order does matter so right here Order does matter.  All right.  No, not you say then I realized that was not good to be a picky eater.  What are the flavor that I'm eating is going to end up in my sandwich anyway, but it does it doesn't matter the order. So what happened when I relax the condition on order.  So now this is a place where the orders does not matter anymore.  And what happened in this case when I don't care about the other then I'm going to have phenomenal like this if you have vanilla on top and chocolate in the bottom. This is going to be the same as chocolate on top vanilla in the bottom.  Today's economy the same when I don't care about the order.  And what happened to my previous account that I have previously I say that while I have an X and -1 charges.  And now in here when I don't care what the order so this is not going to be the same as the same as this previously. I count them differently. And now when I remove the restriction on order these to allow the same.  Are we going up to this? So This basically create the kind of symmetry in the object of Lea County right? Because the Symmetry in his top bottom bottom top  So what about on soda I have from before.  These guys they all happened how exactly twice.  So I met a Mystic from before if I remove the restriction on order and this is not going to give me the correct answer and impact anything in here has been caught twice.  So, how do I adjust for that?  divided by 2  So so what is going on in here so we can be seen at the number of symmetry?  That I have and in here. I only have two symmetries because top bottom bottom top. I'm going to be the same as a 2 symmetries. I take the total number of objects / 2, so this will not be a correct answer. So next time what we going to do is we going to look at more complicated having problems that involve Symmetry and eventually we're going to end up with counting the faces of the Rubik's Cube calc out in the arrangement of the Rubik's Cube on Tuesday.
