That's not very important but is  Is something that my wife was wondering you guys thought about me?  And it was if anybody has seen any of the Harry Harry Potter Henry Potter.  Henry Potter  if I were to go to Hogwarts, what would the selecting have put me in?  Okay.  Gryffindor  Ravenclaw  What is it Hufflepuff?  or  Slytherin  with a y  like that  So use your kickers, you don't have to participate if you don't want to I know this is just something stupid, but she asked me this to she has an idea to so she just wants to know if it was like a more.  And I thought you guys would be you all would know this story better than I do.  Okay good.  All right. I'm going to record this data and wait. Is this the only four?  Okay.  Is there a secret one?  What's e?  All right. I'm going to record this.  She's going to be very happy. Thank you.  Okay, so thank you for that. Sorry about being on being silly in class. I know that we should be.  the result was  is that what you guys think? That's what she thought too, but I don't really know. I never I didn't really see the movie so I don't really know the thing, but I guess I guess.  You can.  the guy fighting things  Finding okay good.  I'm going to finding algorithms. Okay, good.  All right. Let's go to another.  Topic or the topic that we looked at before?  Thank you for that again. So base theorem.  And remember let's just go through this again a manufacturer claims that there's a drug test that will detect steroid use 95% of the time but the company does not tell you is that 15% of all steroid free individuals also test positive 10% of the Tour de France bike racers use steroids your favorite cyclist just tested positive. What's the probability that he use steroids and we already did this guessing so we'll just move on from there.  Okay, so I notice kind of what we're asking and what information were given right. This is what we want to know the probability that my favorite cyclist use steroids given that he tested positive. I know for a fact that he tested positive but given that information now, how can I figure out what's the probability that he actually used?  Okay. So let's just say f is athletes that used steroids. He's athletes that tested positive. So this is p of f given right?  Now what kind of information are we given? We're actually given p a e given F the probability that a athlete tested positive given that he use steroids. Right if I know for a fact to use steroids, what's the probability is going to test positive? Is anybody know what this is?  given the given this paragraph  95% right. That's what that piece of information is. So this gives you a sense of P of e given f is not always going to be equal to P of f given me right there. They're really different things. So if I know that you tested positive  Used steroids How likely is it that he's going to test positive?  Okay good. So that's what we have there now really. We need to figure out all of these different.  Probabilities I figured out probability of e given F. So  what else do we need to know? We need to know probability of F and probability of f complement. What are these in words?  the probability that what  write the probability that a player use steroids in the probability that a player did not use steroids. So what are these in in numbers?  MPG of f complement is 90% right when you're doing this kind of Base theorem analysis, and you're doing something like this.  This information may not be given this might just be a guess right if I knew exactly the probability somebody use steroids that I probably wouldn't need to use the test. Anyway, so we're just kind of giving an initial test and basing our information off of this test.  Okay, so then the last thing is the probability of e given F compliment. How do you say that in words?  probability of e given F complement  probability that  Tested positive.  given that  He didn't.  use steroids  Okay now.  What is that? Are we giving this information?  This is a false positive right? It's positive, but it was false.  Nights are this is .15.  Okay. So now we have all the information we got we've gained from this paragraph you plug it in and what do you get?  41%  so don't always equate that. It's it'll detect with 95% Don't don't equate that with meaning if you test positive then it's 95% chance that you actually used. Right. So these are are very different probabilities and they're based on a bunch of different things. The reason why this is so low or this is kind of unnaturally low is because not many people actually use steroids, right? And so  You can have to take that into consideration. If you didn't know anything, if you didn't know any results of the test, then there's a 10% chance that your favorite player use steroids. But if he tested positive which is a pretty high increase, but it's still overall not.  I mean not anywhere near ninety 95%  Okay, let's do another example.  So this is often a  application of Base theorem. This is called a Bayesian spam filter or a Bayesian filter and what it does that uses Bayes theorem to figure out with a high chance of probability when a certain email or message is Spam based on the contents and so it just scans through and look for keywords. And if it finds one of those keywords and it knows with a certain probability that it's spam or not, right? No spam filter is going to be 100% accurate, but the better, you know, the more keywords you use the better you can make it.  Okay, so  me, for example, I don't really buy Rolexes or look at them. And so  If there if the word Rolex comes up in one of my emails, it's likely to be spam. Right so  and let's say it comes up in 250 out of two thousand messages known to be spam.  And 5 out of a thousand messages. No not to be spam. Right? So maybe there was a few talking about it, but it's it's highly unlikely that a Spam message will be I mean that a Rolex message will not be spent will not be spent.  Okay. Now the probability that an incoming message containing the word Rolex is Spam. That's what we want to estimate given that let's say.  Every email I get as a 50-50 chance, it will be spam. I don't really know what the what a better estimate is, but that seems pretty good, right?  so what do you guys think is a good estimation of are the  basically the how good is this spam filter with what probability does it throw things into the spam folder?  That contain the word Rolex.  Okay good. So now we're like a little bit more skeptical but really the probability will speak for itself, right?  okay, so let's just go through the  each term one by one  so what we want is the probability that a message is Spam given that it contains the word Rolex because  Our our spam filter is going to look and it's going to know that it contains the word Rolex and now it needs to know how sure are you are you going to put it into the spam folder or the inbox? Okay. So let's say he is contains Rolex at the spam and let's just start feeling these in  What is p of e given f?  Okay good.  125  Right is the probability?  that  a message contains Rolex given that it's spam. That's this, right.  Cuz these are known to be spam. So it's 250 / 2,000 is equal to 0.125. This is p of e given at.  Okay. Now. He given F compliment that is 5 out of a thousand.  We know that the message is not spam and it contains the word Rolex.  Okay, and then we're going to just assume that being spam and not being spam is equally likely so then plug all these numbers in and you get 96%  which is pretty good, right?  Did we what?  So the 96% is the likelihood that my spam filter did its job correctly?  Write the spam filter is going to look for the word Rolex and it's going to throw it in my spam box going to throw it in my garbage.  So that's that's assuming that an incoming message as spam or not spam equally likely. Yeah.  and of course these numbers might change for whatever your  How will your messages come in but you can see that I mean, this is just one key word. So it's not going to throw away all your spam. So you might want to have a few different keywords.  Whenever one that one of those comes up, you can figure out what the likelihood that you throw it away any other questions about this?  Okay. So the next thing we're going to do is we're going to kind of open up the world of probability to this other kind of function is called a random variable and  like I said last time probability has  The same kind of mathematical objects we've been working with but they just use different names. And so they have this thing called a random variable and it's a really unfortunate name because for one it's not random and for two, it's not a variable.  Instead. It's a function. It's a function.  that Maps the sample space  to the real numbers or just being off the any number.  Okay, but what is the motivation for random variables X and outcome has a number associated with it right rolling two dice. Maybe the number associated with it. Is there some or flipping a heads flipping a heads or tails? Maybe the number associated with heads as one and with tails is zero or something like that, or maybe you want to know the number of heads after flipping a bunch of coins. Maybe you're rolling a dice and you want to know the maximum of the two dice, right or  This is something that will look at next week the time that I randomize algorithm takes to run could be a random variable.  So think about it as attaching a number to each outcome and it can be whatever you want. But we're going to look at some particular examples today.  was that  a ratio  I suppose you could you can put ratios there. Yeah, it just like you could put whatever number you want on to any outcome you want and that will be a random variable. But often times it's nice to kind of have the random variable have some sort of meaning some sort of link to the outcome. Like for example, the total sum of the two dice is very clear what the random variable is, right? You roll two dice. You have all these different outcomes to get the random variable. You just add the outcomes.  But you will see some more examples.  Okay, so here is what I said before a random variable is a function from the sample space to the real numbers.  Then there's a distribution on random variables. So it's kind of like instead of looking at the outcomes were looking at what the random variable values are. Okay. What's the probability that an outcome will have a random variable equal to our that's what this is. This is the distribution.  Where's my?  Okay, so then there's something now on once we have a random variable now we can talk about something call expectation or expected value or if you just like you just call it like the average.  And the expected expectation of a random variable on a sample space is basically the average of all the random variable values or in other words if you want to be more precise.  You sum up overall outcome.  And you multiply the probability of that outcome bias random variable value. Okay. Another way that you can do it and alternate form is to sum up over all possible random variable values.  Figure out the probability that your outcome the random variable of your outcome is equal to that number and multiply it by the number and these are equivalent form so you can use either one, but honestly once we get a little bit more complicated examples you're going to see that there's other tricks to use to calculate expectation that are much better than calculating it out directly.  Okay.  Let's let's say that the random variable here is the number of Pips showing on a die after it's rolled once so I roll a die. There's six possible outcomes. The random variable is just the number that the die shows. I'm so that's a perfectly reasonable random variable to put  so what is the expected number?  That I'm going to roll.  And what's the expectation of this random variable? Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use  this version  you some over all the possible random variable values.  right  you figure out the probability that the outcome is that random variable value and then you multiply it by the random variable value. So the only possible random variable values are 1 2 3 4 5 and 6.  We're going to assume that the dice is fair until each one of these probabilities is 1/6.  And so you multiply 1/6 by each one of those random variable values and add them up.  And you get 3.5 SE that since this is a uniform distribution. All we're really doing is taking the average overall values.  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 all divided by 6 is 3.5.  So this means if I roll one dice over and over and over again, and I take the average the average going to be close to 3.5 one kind of consequence get any questions.  No.  Yeah, this is not going to be on the midterm.  rent  yeah, the midterm is mainly going to be  iterative recursive sorting algorithms those kind of things Master theorem runtime analysis correctness proofs and  Show the stars and bars and coding Huffman encoding.  That kind of stuff.  a good question  All right.  question  Yes.  Let's fuk.  So we roll two dice and we let the random variable be there some some of the two values right then the random variable if I roll a 5 in a 2 will be 7 or 3 and 3 will be 6. So now the distribution is not uniform anymore. Right? It's much more likely that you're going to roll a 5 and you're going to roll a 2.  and so  you basically count up in this graph write the height of each.  What do you call it power for the probability that X is 7 right P of x equals 7 probably random variable is 7/6 / 36 because there are six different ways you can get seven and there's 36 possible.  outcomes  So let's figure out what is the expected value of?  Rolling the maximum of two dice.  Well, we can do this use this same.  summation  over all possible random variable values. What are the possible values you can get anything from 2 up to 12, right?  So you figure out what's the probability that you get that random variable and X the random variable. So we have to * 163 * 1 / 18 4 * 1 / 12 and all of this stuff this whole mess.  And you get seven?  Okay, there's a easier way to do it. So don't be too concerned about this. But that's for this particular problem. Sometimes there's not a easier way and you just have to list them all out.  And that's the best way to do it for this one will see a different way any questions.  No, that's the easier way to do it.  Yeah.  What's that?  We have to make a run to the center.  So it's like a different kind of a little bit more of a complicated example, we can talk about that a little bit later if you like.  Okay.  so  back to this song assuming that  show me that having a boy and a girl is equally likely in a family.  Calculate the expected number of boys in a family with two children.  Okay. Let's let's do it the hard way what will look at the easy way in a minute, but doing it the kind of  Listing everything out. What are the all the possible?  Outcomes that you can have with two children and be girl girl girl, boy boy girl and boy boy, we're trying to find the expected number of boys in a family, right?  So this is your random variable.  Which means that you're going to assign a number to each outcome based on this. So what sex of Gigi?  0 because there is zero boys night EXO. GB is 1x of BG is 1x of BB is to  so if I use this thing where I come over all the possibilities  Write all the possible outcomes and multiply each.  outcome random variable with its probability I get  let's just write it out PE of g g x x of Gigi.  + P of so, this is this right here  key of G B * X of GB  plus P of BG  x x b g  Plus P of bb.  x x of bb  Okay. So this is going to be 1/4 * 0 + 1/4 * 1 + 1/4 * 1 + 1/4 * 2 which is equal to what in this is like what will look at a better way to do it. But for now, I just wanted to kind of give you a sense that it works out by doing it using the definition.  Okay, good. So everybody got that one. That's good. Let's go to the next one.  What if we had three children?  Okay good. So there's a few ways we can think about this one is that since this is a uniform distribution over all outcomes. We can just take the  the average over all the random variables  Frank  Okay, so  well, there's going to be one way to get 0 + 3 ways to get one.  write + 3 ways to get to  And then one way to get three we divide it all out by 8 and you get one two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine.  Put 3 or 12:12 or 8 which is equal to 1.5.  So  the other way that we can do it has to do with something called linearity of expectation and that's what we're going to do in a minute. But what I want to kind of emphasize here before is that the expected value might not be a possible value of the random variables, right? There's no way that I'm going to have one point five boys in the  family  But this still could be an expected value.  No.  I guess.  No, because I would argue that the the the child in that show is not half a man.  He's a child.  He's not a man.  I call it two men and a child.  Henry Potter 2 minutes. I don't know.  Okay, so here are some properties of expectation to just keep in mind. It doesn't have to be actual possible value of x think about it as an average. The average doesn't have to be one of the values right but it also has to be in between the Min and Max just like the average does.  okay, so here is  one of the biggest  What do you call it tricks or properties one of the biggest properties of expectation? This is going to allow us to calculate expectations with a lot more simpler methods then by writing out that whole mess every time it's called the linearity of expectation. Okay, which means that if you have a bunch of random variables x 1 through xn  right  And you some them up together to get another random variable.  Then the expectation of their sum is equal to the sum of their expectations.  Okay, let's just do like a little simple proof. Let's suppose that my random variable X is the sum of two random variables. This is a very natural thing to do in certain situations. In fact, this is exactly what rolling the two dice is right you're stunning up the random variable of the first ice plus the random variable of the second dice. This is also like the the example of having children. How many boys do you have in the family? The first random variable will be one if you have a boy and 0 if you have a girl one and in the second random variables for the second Kid third variables for the third kid, and you add them all together.  okay, so recall that this is the  Definition your summing up all over all the possible outcomes and probability times a random variable. Let's rewrite the random variable as it's some  but since it's a some it's a finite sum, you can just break it apart like this.  But these individually or just the expected values of those two random variables questions about this.  Okay, so this always works.  Linearity of expectation always works like this. It's it's sometimes it's a question.  What are use what?  Oh.  Oh, I I think I took away something.  Thank you.  Okay. So this might just seem like it's a theorem but you're going to see that this theorem is surprising in that it always works. Even when the random variables are not independent which means that they could kind of affect each other but you can still always split them up and that's what makes this such a powerful theorem.  Okay. So for this example, it's actually not so surprising right the  expected value of  their sum is the sum of their expected values and we even saw this because the expected value for a 4-1 dice was 3.5 + 3.5 and then you just get seven.  Okay, so now let's look at a different example.  This one might be a little bit more surprising. Okay, so let's suppose that I flip a coin.  end times  what's the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads?  Text message look at example if I did something like heads Heads Tails heads Tails Tails heads heads heads.  Heads Tails heads How many pairs of consecutive heads are there in this example?  1 2 3 4  that's how I'm to find them.  Okay.  So good. Are you guys guessing or do you know?  Guessing Okay good guesses.  Good guesses.  All right. Let's see how to actually calculate it cuz this is like going to be the type of problem that we ask you for expectation is something like this and you're going to be expected to know how to do it. So  we're going to use something called an indicator.  random  variable  we'll talk about that a little bit more detail in a minute, but it's basically just a random variable. That only has the value of 0 + 1.  only  has values  0 + 1  Okay, and what we're going to do is we're going to take this random variable that we're trying to find the expectation of and split it up into a sum of indicator variables. So what is the random variable we're trying to find well or that we were talking about it's the number of pairs of consecutive heads.  Okay. So what we're going to do is look at each position. Okay position one. If there is a consecutive heads a pair of consecutive heads starting at position 1 then the random variable there is one if there's not then the random variable there is zero.  Okay. Well will spell this out in a minute, but let me show you kind of how this works on this example.  Okay, so here.  This is going to be a one because there is a pair of consecutive head starting at the first position. This will be a zero because there's a there's not a pair of consecutive had starting at the second position and so on 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 sorry this one.  We don't even use that one.  Okay, so we're going to make a some of these little indicator but just kind of like you turn them on and off right there either one or zero, but notice that if I some all of these up I get to four which is exactly what the random variable value of this is.  Okay, so  let's move on.  Define x i to be equal to 1 if both the ice and I + first flips RH + 0 otherwise  Hi, this is the indicator variable.  now  we can Define our original random variable as the sum of all the indicators, right? Cuz it's just going to add one if it's there and Adizero if it's not so at each eye. What is  the expected value of x i  Okay.  We're mostly saying 1/4. Where is that 1/4 come from?  Heads or tails Tails heads or tails tails?  Okay good.  So that position I the probability that that position and the next value are both heads is one out of four because these are the only possible choice and each one is equally likely right.  And I'll show you this in a minute, but the expected value of an indicator variable is the probability that that indicator variable is equal to 1 which is 1/4.  Okay, are there any questions about that?  Okay good.  So we're pretty much done now.  Let me just finish up. We had that X is equal to the sum over. I equals 1 of 2 N -1 x I give me of x i  But I know that what I'm trying to get is the expected value of x because of linearity of expectation. I can move that expectation inside the sum.  even though  these excise kind of depend on each other right depends on if it was a head or tails and stuff. But this is the strength of linearity of expectation as you can split it up and have everything packed independently.  okay, so this is equal to well, I equals 1/2 and -1 of 1/4, which is what  + - 1/4  So we're lucky here because each one of these are expected values is the same. So we just summing up that number a bunch of times.  Okay, so this is kind of just what we did.  Okay, are there any questions about that?  If you did this experiment a bunch of times.  Then you took the average over all of these things you find that they were on average around and -1 / 4.  consecutive heads  Okay. So this is the indicator variable and this is a really good way of splitting up a random variable so that you can use linearity of expectation.  Okay, an indicator random variable X.  is a function from the sample space 2 0 1  what is the expected value of an indicator random variable?  Okay, one way we can kind of justify this or prove this or figure it out is to write out the definition of expected value, right?  EFX is the sum over all possible random variables probability that the random variable is equal to x x a random variable in an indicator random variable. There's only two possibilities. So this some only has two terms right? It's equal to the probability that X is equal to 0 times 0 plus the probability that X is equal to 1 * 1 which is just  the probability that X is equal to 1  okay, and then we kind of saw this already in the other example, so that's another reason why indicator variables are really useful is because it's really easy to find their probabilities or to find their expectations.  Any other questions about that?  Driving for a really random variable.  I guess you could say if the random variable is one you call it a success and if it's a zero, you call it a failure.  Yeah, we're the problem.  volume is the probability that  yeah, you can think about it that way I guess.  But we use it more as just like a tool to to invoke the linearity of expectation to make the problem a little easier.  All right, let's look it up boar.  challenging example  Okay, so  we're going to start with an algorithm.  Hopefully this is the algorithm that everybody is familiar with or at least has kind of implemented this or understood how it works at some point. That's a moment. You just finding the max of some list of numbers.  How do you do it while you set the max to be the first number and then you iterate through the list?  And if you ever find a bigger number, you reset that variable any questions.  Okay, so if the rain is in random order.  What I'm what I'm wondering is how many times do we expect to change it?  What if how many times do you expect to reset this maximum?  What is resetting the maximum was like a very expensive thing to do or took up a lot of time or took a lot of resources to do you want to know? Well, what what am I expected to get into? What is what's going to be the expected number of times? I reset the maximum.  Of course, it's depending on the order. So what's the what's the minimum number of times that the let's do it that way.  minimum minimum  I guess I meant to say x is the number of times the max changes so the minimum value of x.  Is what?  04 I guess. It depends on what you what you constitute a change.  I'm going to say that this this is not considered a change. It's only a considered a change here.  I don't know cuz it doesn't really matter so much right. It's just going to be off by 1 so the minimum value of x is 0 the maximum value is  and -1. This is if the list is increasing decreasing right at the front.  first element  and that man is one as if it's in increasing order.  So what do you expect the average to be?  If that would have been a good clicker question.  Let's do it.  You guys are already starting to gas.  I mean put the things up there yet.  I haven't even put the choices yet.  okay, who thinks it's  2 to the N minus 1  what about  log of + -1  how about  And shoes too.  What about in - 1 / 2?  what about  what about I don't know.  I don't know.  I what's the expected number or just kind of off the top of your head?  Okay, it's actually none of these.  What is really really really close to one of them? Okay.  It's really close to login.  We are rising.  Really close to login is that the case write the maximum of a 10-1 the minimum is zero. Why is the average solo so much lower than over to what's because most of the most of the time you don't change the maximum that often write for us for a particular random list. And in fact the farther down the list you go the less likely that you're going to change the maximum again, right? You might change it a bunch of the start, but it might get less and less down the line.  But maybe that doesn't help and you really want to see kind of how to how are we going to get a more concrete answer. How do we actually compute the exact expected value and we can and when will do it now?  Okay now.  Remember X is the number of times the max changes for a random input of size n so really what we want to do is split X into a sum of indicator random variables. What would you like this indicator random variable to be  do you want it to be one if a eye is bigger than a i - 11 if AI is bigger than Max or one if AI is bigger than 1  Okay good.  so  we wanted to be this and why is that it's because when a eye is bigger than Max that's when we change and so we want to we want that indicator to be whenever that happens.  Okay good.  Are there any questions about the indicator?  was that  because if write the F. Yeah, so you can kind of think about it as the if statement being true or false you're counting the number of times. It's true or the kind of a number of times this morning.  Yes.  Okay good.  Okay. Sorry now is equal to 1 if a is bigger than Max and zero. Otherwise, what is a of X I will be all know that it's e of X is equal to the probability that X is equal to one bright.  In other words, it's equal to the probability that a eye is bigger than the max.  I want you all to take a few minutes to talk with your neighbors and figure out what is this probability ready go?  I'll put it in another form to that might be helpful. This is also the probability that a i  is bigger  then  A1 A2 all the way up to a i - 1  right because the max is going to be the biggest of these ones. So if it's bigger than the max is bigger than all of these what's that probability?  text  what happened there?  Okay, what did you guys get?  anybody  how did you get that?  elements available for you  Okay. So this is like we're really only comparing it to these ones, right?  Okay, let's think about this. Let's that maybe have another.  Sorry.  Light Element is equally likely to be the max. There's only one element bit.  I think it's why we're not.  was that  Display the previous number picker.  How do you spell Makayla?  Okay.  Anybody else?  or anybody have any comments or  Okay, is this one?  Okay.  Thank you was ever mean to me for him?  Okay, thank you. I don't want to steal your clap and his his explanation was pretty good about how I think about it right you.  You have some list of I element right? They could be in any order. Right? But let's let's just suppose that all the elements are different. Okay, then one of those elements is going to be the maximum, right? What's the probability that the last?  Well, the last one could really be any eye of those elements. So it's one over I  common sense  do I have more to do with like The Ordering of all the numbers rather than  Looking at each number individually, I guess.  Where are comparing them pairwise?  Any other questions or comments or clarifications?  And now you can kind of see that as you go farther down the list. It's less and less likely that your last number is going to be the maximum of the rest of the list, right because the list is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Okay, so  This is what we have expected value of x is 1 / I so the expected value of x is the sum of all the expected values.  which is  the sum of all one over I  Have you guys ever seen this before?  This is called a harmonic number.  and it's it's close to the natural log of n  and the real one of the reasons is because  this someone over I  Is very close to the integral of DX over X?  Because one of them is the Riemann sum and the other one is the the area under the curve and and this integral is going to be natural log X. I guess I guess you're going from to  Up to n or something from 2 of 2 end.  So it really be natural login.  Natural again, maybe minus natural log 2 or something.  But in any case it's close to login, and I guess you would say, it's Big O of login or big fader of login.  sup  It's actually going to be very a lot smaller than what we sort of expected at first, which was in / 2.  Okay, any questions about that comments?  This one. I just put this little like approximate because it's kind of like approximated by.  yeah, maybe I should put natural log here log base e  song  What is one thing I want you to get out of this is noticed that each one of those indicator variables. You're kind of looking at it individually, you didn't really care how they interacted with each other if if the ice.  element was actually the new maximum, you know, if the iplus first element would be the new maximum to write like those things are going to they all kind of interact with each other all of those indicator random variables are not independent they kind of affect each other but the strength of linearity of expectation is it always works no matter what even if the random variables are are not independent like in this example, you can just compute each one individually kind of just look at it without thinking about any of the other ones and then some  Okay, so this is called.  Yeah, that's alright. Let's move on.  Or any other questions or comments?  Why are they not independent?  So they're not independent is because  Iowa okay, let's say you had the numbers like 1 through 4, right?  and  You said maybe start off with like to 214 and then the next number. This is not the best.  Not being dependent.  What day of I have to be?  They have to be.  daily numbers in our brains are like going from 0 to 10 and now I'm  No, I I guess if let's say that you're going numbers from 1 to 10, right and let's say that the fifth number was was a new maximum. So it was maybe like to 136 and then ate right now.  If the new number wasn't a new Maxima if the fifth number was not a new maximum. Let's say in this scenario, maybe like five four.  7 to 3  It's more likely that this one's going to be a new maximum than it is here, right because seven is less than 8. I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is that  All of these things kind of interact with each other.  The kind of like intermixed depending on what happened before?  But maybe your your interpretation is right to if you're just thinking about which number is the maximum and not really care about their values then maybe you can you can separate them. I don't know if that's exactly what you were saying.  But in any case this will always work so you don't have to worry about it is but I'm trying to get at  Okay, so  Let's move on to.  something called conditional expectation  Okay.  Conditional expectation. This is another kind of trick that you can use to find the expectation. You basically break it up break your sample space up into two disjoint sets.  Scuse me to disjoint events.  Call them a and a compliment.  Okay, then you figure out what's the expectation in a and then add it to the expectation in a compliment and put it all together.  So here's kind of a simple example.  Let's say x is the number of pairs of consecutive heads when you flip a Fair coin three times.  What is the expectation of x?  We kind of already did this one in general, but I want to use it as a example for this conditional expectation.  Okay. So what we're going to do or one way to do it is to just do it directly or do it the way we did it before another way to do it is condition on.  The middle flip is a heads.  Think about the middle flip is going to kind of tell you if it's even possible to have consecutive pairs. Okay. So which subset of as is a if a is the event the middle flip is H.  Okay good.  Dee Wright, it's all of the outcomes where the middle flip is H.  Okay, good. Now this is what we want to compute.  Hey is this if so, what is the probability of a?  Well, there were four out of eight.  So 1/2. What about the probability of a complement?  also 4 out of 8 1/2  Okay. So here's what here's why I wanted to use this as an illustration. What is the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads given that your outcome is eating a compliment given that the middle flip is Tails.  0  this thing is 0-4 that just canceled out that whole term. And now all we have to do is  Count this one here.  This one's pretty easy to count the expected number of heads, cuz the pairs of consecutive head given that the middle flip is ahead. Well that just turns into you know, do I have a head at the start? And do I have a head at the end?  I think so. We have that. That's fair. If the middle flip is a heads than the number of pairs of consecutive heads equals the number of heads in the first and last flip and so we can just compute this directly. It's going to be well you could have tails heads Tails. That's 0 * 1/4 + heads Heads Tails. That's One X 1/4 + Tails heads Heads. That's One X 1/4 + heads heads heads.  which is 2 * 1/4 and so you get  what is that 1/2?  No one right.  Okay good. So that's one. She plugged that in and you get 1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * 0 and you just get one half.  Okay, that's one way to use it. The main thing that we're going to do with.  And in condition condition case analysis conditional expectations is something called ending condition. So let me introduce this concept. We might not get through it all the way but at least you can go home with something to think about.  So we're going back to Bernoulli trials.  So something that has a success and a failure. Let's think maybe every time I play Solitaire. I have a probability of P of winning and a probability of 1 - P of losing I want to play until I win a game. How many games do you expect me to play?  What about each time a child is born and has probability P of being left handed.  And we're we're assuming there's only two handedness is Left-Handed and right-handed.  Okay, what how many kids let's say I really really want a left-handed kid. How many kids do you expect me to have?  Okay, so  Just to kind of as your first guess.  What do you what do you think about this expected value? What is the expected number of games of kids of Bernoulli trials that I have to do before I get a single success. But I'll keep on going until I do I'm very persistent.  I keep on going back to the selecting hat until they give me Hufflepuff.  Wait, can you go multiple times? No?  It won't select everybody.  It just knows.  Okay, we can I choose though.  What if I buy them?  You try huh?  Okay lock this one in.  Okay. Good one over P. This is a good good thought right, it's correct. Let's say that one out of 10 children are left-handed. I'm expected to have 10 children before I have a left-handed one, right? Let's say if it's  Yeah.  Exactly. Okay, so we'll we'll talk about how to actually compute this. So you have a sense, but this is  something to keep in mind  proctoring stuff "
