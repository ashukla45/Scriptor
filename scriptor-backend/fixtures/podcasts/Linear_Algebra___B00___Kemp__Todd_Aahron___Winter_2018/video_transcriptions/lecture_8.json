Which is yesterday's lecture last days lecture and today's lecture are more abstract than the ones that we had done before and I thought you were going to move to the most abstract lectures that you've been to.  In a math class ever.  And in order to understand what's going on in this kind of material, you have to think like a mathematician. This is how a mathematician thinks his song lyrics is everybody was kung fu fighting that means oh my gosh there a lot of people around Kung Fu Fighting Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting that means literally everybody in the world was Kung Fu Fighting.  When you are reading an understanding the definitions and theorems and examples and Concepts in this class particularly, the more abstract part that we're in right now, you need to think ridiculously fitt surely not everybody was kung fu fighting well know if that's what the statement says. That's literally literally when we have definitions like the definition of linear Independence. I'd like some definitions were going to get you today like for a function being on two or one to one you need to read carefully and you need to think about all the Clauses in the sentence and what they mean literally and exactly over and over as you go until it becomes second nature. That is mathematics. This is a mathematics course, even if you've taken calculus before you probably never really taken a mathematics course.  This is a mathematics course about that has a lot of mathematical thinking in it. Not just grinding out answers know you could all be successful at it, but it just requires a little bit of extra mental gymnastics getting out of the habit of interpreting things colloquially and interpreting them literally abstract lecture today, but that's super important before we get there to the Matrix of a linear transformation contains talk about linear Transformations today and next week. We'll move on to Matrix operations are going to be a little more concrete again, but of course fitting into what we've been doing  The cutoff for next week's midterm in terms of what materials covered is after today's lecture. So we will finish chapter one will finish with Section 1.9 today. And that is if you've already seen the practice midterms that have been posted. Hey, they're very similar in style and length and content to what you will be working on on next Wednesday evenings midterm or mid-term is next Wednesday evening, January 31st, 8 p.m. Start time the 50-minute exam, but you'll have up to 2 hours to do it. You will be in one of the three rooms that are mentioned on the course webpage checked right Ned to see what is your room and your seat number in that room before you arrive.  But I'll keep reminding you of that.  We also have the second Matlab homework set do tonight by 11:59 p.m. On gradescope. Make sure you submit it to the grades Golf Course corresponding to Matlab that you did last time cuz of you've also got an email this week about a new gradescope course you've been enrolled in that's the one where you will see your graded midterm appear like next week, by the way. Our intention is to have the midterms totally grated, and I will post a provisional letter grade for you in this class before next Friday. Next Friday is the drop that drop without a w deadline. Thanks. So I want you to have as much information as possible before that deadline passes before Wednesday evening before Friday evening to give you a professional-grade baseball.  And finally, you have MyMathLab homework number three due this coming Monday by 11:59 p.m.  All right. So I think that covers are administered via for today. So let's go back to what we were discussing at the end of the last lecture.  So we're talking about linear Transformations. Remember that just means linear function functions.  From RN to RM between two Vector spaces to in a list of real numbers two sets of list of real numbers.  But not just any old function functions that are linear which means that they respect the linear structure. They respect the linear operations operation was our definition of vague quantities with length and Direction magnitude and direction. We were more precise here and said vectors their lists of numbers important factors of the vector operations that you can add two vectors and you can scale a x vectors by scalars for real numbers.  Vector operations and a linear function between vectors A linear transformation is a function between vectors that respects those operations.  If I want to apply that function to a sum of two vectors, that's the same thing as if I apply the function to the pictures and then add afterward it distributes across the Sun similarly. If I apply my linear transformation to a scales Vector the linear operations some and scalar multiplication.  So that's the abstract definition of what a linear transformation is and we saw last time we spent all of last lecture studying a large class of important examples of these guys Matrix transformations.  isometric transformations  Which are those given by?  The value of the function t on the vector X by X some fixed Matrix is in RN then a has to be an M by n Matrix and then it's output is an RM. So that gives you a bunch of each M by n Matrix gives you a linear transformation from RN to RM by matrix multiplication.  Now we're going to see you shortly that those are actually all linear transformation is not just a classic example. That's it. Those are the only kind of almost immediately best and worst at the end of last lecture. So let's reiterate what we said at the end of last lecture just a little rushed respecting one for example as we noted last time.  Is 0 is always fixed by such a linear transformation. That is the image of 0 under a linear transformation is always the zero Vector that's true for Matrix transformations. Of course, we use any homogeneous system has the solution x equals 0  And then if we put these two operations together adding and multiplying a group of vectors, then we can push the T pushed Transformations through both repeatedly.  And guess that's the same thing as T 1 x t a v 1 + P 2/10 T of V2 Etc down the line.  Pay for any finite list of vectors like that and that this is sometimes given the fancy name the superposition principle.  Okay. Well that has an immediate consequence.  That really helped us understand what these linear Transformations are quickly at the end of the last lecture.  Me stay consistent with the notation here and make the output RM.  transformation from R32 RN for some at real value in our 505 space of vectors RM  And I want to show you a general picture of the action of a linear transformation on a three dimensional vector. And what we saw last time is that we can just always decompose that Vector that we can always decompose it like this steps.  Can you deposit at the vector x 1 0 0 + 0 0 + 0 0 x 3 vector addition works?  And similarly each one of those three factors. I cannot pull out the parameter like we do and we're doing parametric Solutions.  So I can pull up the X1 from the first one. That gives me 100.  Vortex 2 from the second one that gives me 001  I can plot X3 from the third one. I was right that give me a 0 1 0 there and then 001 is one that comes up with the X3.  Okay. Well, that's kind of a funny thing to do unsimplified the vector X1 X2 X3, but I did it because now I can apply this position to this case right here.  and right this is all very pull out that scalar x one that's x 1 x t of 100 + X2 x t of 010 + x 3 * T of 001  Now what's so great about that?  What's so great about that is that I've now got these three vectors the vector tea of 100.  the vector tea of 010 and the vector tea of 001  Those are three vectors T of 100 T of 010 and T of 0:01. Let me call those vectors.  A1  A2 and A3  So I haven't told you what tea is that an R32 RN?  What I now know is that there are three special vectors these ones A1 A2 and A3 and if I have knowledge of what those three vectors are if I tell you what the image of tea is on the vectors 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 these three vectors A1 A2 and A3 if I know them then I know T. I know what tea does to every Vector because I can then calculate what tea is on a 1 x 2 x 3 X1 a OnePlus X  This is very unlike any kind of functions that we study in calculus or whatever like the ones we did last lecture at the beginning that polynomial function sine function. If I only know a polynomial formula for the polynomial p is a polynomial function value of the function is okay, but for any linear transformation on R3, I only need to tell you what the value on three vectors and then I know what it does everywhere. I know the function that's a remarkable property.  and it's what makes the Transformations relatively easy compared to other more complicated functions that works out special vectors 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1  those generalize if I'm an RN.  There are any specials actors?  E1 E2 in the one position and everywhere else has a one in the two position and zeros everywhere else and so on Down the Line.  Okay, these vectors we call the standard basis vectors. We're going to make precise this term basis next week or possibly the week after so for now don't worry about what exactly that word basis means except that in this special case standard basis vectors.  Okay. So for example in our two there are two of them.  There are two of them and they are the vectors 1 0 and 0 1.  They're the coordinate axes in our to write the unit lights vectors up and right along the coordinate axes.  There are three. Those are the ones that we just saw in the calculation on the last page.  That the three vectors is 100010 and 001. Those are the standard basis vectors.  No, we're already in the business of taking collections of vectors and string them together as The Columns of a matrix. So let's do that with these guys if I take the standard basis as The Columns of a square Matrix cuz there's going to be an of them actors in their High 10. I get a square Matrix and it's this one here 1000, 01000 NE 2nd and so on. It's a matrix that has ones down the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else that Matrix has a name that you've probably seen already in the text book called the identity Matrix.  But given that name it's also an important Matrix that you see coming off a lot.  If you are solving a system of and equations in an unknown number of equations as unknowns, then you going to solve that system by doing.  row reduction enthusiastically  And if you want to see that that system has a unique solution. What you're looking for is for the reduced row Echelon form of the best. This is the rref of the coefficient Matrix of a system that has that is consistent and has a unique solution, right? There's no zeros at the bottom. So, you know you and there's no non pivotal columns are there no free variables. And this is the only way that can happen. If you have a square system. This is the only form you can have for the reduced row Echelon form of a coefficient Matrix if you wanted to have a unique solution for every Point b a x equals p  Pics of it it comes up in lots of different contexts and they're all related.  What is the standard basis vectors and they are The Columns of the identity Matrix and they are by the way. I know it's value. I know it's image everywhere. Okay, so that's the that's the thing. I'm here and actually more than that. I know the value of the transformation everywhere, but actually it's easy to compute it determined by the image. It takes on the Santa Fe suspect and moreover.  Every linear transformation is a matrix transformation. We started last lecture but the fact of the matter is that that wasn't a generalization at all. Every single linear transformation is actually a matrix transformation and we can figure out what the Matrix is immediately I'm going to do exactly what I did on the first slide again one more step to see how that works. So let's do it again with with our 3. So I have I want to figure out what my Vector what my transformation T. Does the vector X1 X2 X3 a generic Vector in R3  so I write it like the 4 x 1 x the vector 100 + X2 X the vector 010 + x 3 * 2001  Let's go ahead and rewrite that using the notation. We introduced on the last slide. Let's go back for Spectre E1.  a second money to the third one E34 ease of writing  using the superposition principle x 1 x t of e 1 + X2 x t of e 2 + x 3 x t of III  Okay, I want to give those three names. So whatever this Vector is whatever the image is on whatever the image of tea is on e tool called that a 2 and whatever the image of III will call that pastry.  Is a radiant one more time.  if I know those three vectors  Text A1 A2 and A3.  Then I know tea because I can compute T of X1 X2 X3 is equal to X 181 + x 282 + x 383, but I'm going to go one more step and rewrite this remember the very definition of matrix multiplication.  If I take the Matrix whose columns are A1 A2 and A3.  then the definition of multiplying that matrix by the column Vector X1 X2 X3 is exactly whatever in there x 21 + x 282 + x 383  Okay, so this Matrix here.  And rewriting it again from what A1 A2 and A3 are that's the Matrix whose columns are the images of tea on the standard basis vectors.  That is called the standard Matrix of t.  If I give you a linear transformation from RN to RM you can immediately produce an M by n Matrix from it just by applying the linear transformation to the standard basis vectors that gives you an column vectors you stream the Matrix. That is the Matrix corresponding is a matrix transformation. It is the Matrix transformation T of x equals a times x. Where is that Matrix there?  Okay case closed every linear transformation is a matrix transformation and this is its Matrix.  Let's do some examples.  So here's a linear transformation.  Is equal to X.  So that's a function. It was a dude of the vector X.  There's nothing to the doctor and I apply tea to it. Okay.  I didn't do anything to do because it does nothing keeps the vector fixed exactly where it was.  Okay, cuz it's it just keeps the identity fixed of that factor now, that's a linear transformation.  Why is it a linear transformation?  Because if I let's just do the addition right if I take too well by definition. That's just U + V.  types of tea does not fix the vector U + V it keeps it fixed but also  You is equal to T of you cuz that's fixed and V is equal to t a v.  So indeed, it's true. It's true automatically. Its function is a linear transformation. That means  that multiplication by  Now let's think about what size that Matrix is. So this is a function of State at the vector accident RN.  So what's going to be the end by animatrix? And we know the standard Matrix is applied to E1 to E2 to Tia fly to Ian.  That's the Matrix of this linear transformation. What does t Duty?  Nothing, it's just leaves it as you want.  it does nothing to eat to it does nothing to eat the standard Matrix of are the standard basis vectors 010  down to  0001  That's the Matrix that we call the identity Matrix and now you know, why?  The identity Matrix is called The Matrix because of the identity function.  Okay.  So there is the Saturn Matrix of the identity function the rotation counterclockwise by 45 degrees in the plane. So that's a function and I rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise means over here 45 degrees counterclockwise. I start with this Vector here and I rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise.  So that function which rotates 45 degrees counterclockwise that is another example of a linear transformation linear linear remind me. What does it mean for a linear transformation, or was it mean for a function to be a linear transformation?  Yes.  It follows Edition skin irritation to get respect addition scalar multiplication to say that is to say that if I rotate and this Factor, okay separately.  And then add them up.  That's the same thing as adding vectors and rotating that one guy 45 degrees. Sound totally picture.  Okay, so here's two vectors.  Let's maybe start with that one.  And maybe one over here.  I'm not going to do 45\u00b0 cuz I don't want the picture to get too messy. But let's look at that rotating the vectors maybe more like 135\u00b0 to over here.  and then  that's something like this.  quite  Approximately exactly to scale but let's not worry about that.  Okay. So what I'm saying is for this to be linear, it has to be true that if I first wrote and then I add them up. Well, let's remember how to add vectors I have to do the parallelogram law.  Guess what? There's a some of those two vectors?  If I rotate and then that's supposed to be the same thing as if I add first.  and then rotate  Add person rotate vs. Rotate first and add it's because of the parallelogram law for addition because if I'd rather two vectors when I add them the song is the diagonal of parallelogram.  Okay, I'm still when I get over to the other side. I'll get the same result of the diagonals that rotated parallelogram is the rotations are rigid few rotate all the vectors parallel.  Okay, so  Rotations are linear Transformations are of X is the linear transformation Rotation by 45 degree angle. That means that this are of X is given by a x x for some make sure that Matrix is going to be a two-by-two matrix rotation. Matrix is just the result of doing the rotation to E1 as the First Column and the results of doing the rotation to eat to the second call.  Okay, so let's figure out what those two are are of E1.  That is the rotation by 45 degrees of the first standard basis vector.  straw picture  supposed to be straight lines  So here's my standard basis vector.  Rotating it up 45 degrees.  I said that one was too long. So let's actually draw a circle here that will help us.  That's roughly a circle.  And so we're rotating up 45\u00b0 to that factor right there to figure out the components of that. We're going to use trigonometry.  Okay, so I need to figure out what that is and what that is down here. So the X component. Well, this angle here is 45 degrees.  So this component on the right here the x-component I guess by dropping down that side of the triangle which is a 45 degree right triangle.  So I remember Pythagoras theorem for a 45 degree right triangle have 45 degrees. What I know is that the two sides of the triangle this one and this one are the same length, and I know that there's some of those two squares by Pythagoras Theorem is one so I can work out that that means that they're red length * 1 / root 2  and so that tells us that this Vector is one of a route to one of her route to  now, what about  are the second standard basis vector?  Why do you have to rotate the whole picture over his so now I need to take.  This Vector the vertical ones are A1 and rotate it over here all the way up to hike like 1 and rotated over here 45 degrees.  And so I draw the same kind of triangle.  That's why I have to drop this down and over. Well, I already figured out this height was one of our route to and buy symmetry. I'm going to get the minus one of her trip to so that one is -1 of a route to one of her route to  so if I put those together the rotation Matrix is 1 / root 2 1 / root 2 in the First Column and -1 / root 2 1 / root 2 in the second column. That is the Matrix of the rotation by 45 degrees counterclockwise in the plane.  Okay, so that was a little more computation and many important geometric examples of therapy radicals.  If you're aware of this but Pythagoras when he discovered what we now call the Pythagorean theorem and realize that it meant that this line here.  Write the length of the lengths here in this Square in this triangle its length would not be a rational number could not be expressed as a over B for natural numbers. He got he formed this call the Pythagorean Society literally beat up people into believing that protect the public from this truce that there are irrational numbers too much of what he said at face value. But anyway, there are certainly important irrational numbers.  Great. So hopefully we have a fairly good handle on how to figure out the Matrix of a linear transformation. You'll need to be able to do that on the homework. And certainly you need to know how to do that. That's what that's fair game for the exam.  No, I want to talk a little bit more about some properties of linear Transformations some new terminology. That's why we have a vocabulary list and understand all the vocabulary terms that we have learned off until the place. We are in the lecture right now. I hope that they're not totally new to you. You should have seen these before maybe even in high school, but we're going to remind you what they mean.  Don't fret we are going to show that these again.  So here's some more function language if I have a function and will in our case were most interested in linear Transformations. So I'll talk about those. I have a linear transformation. It is called on to  if  its range  the whole codo mean  Is there a member at the beginning we talked about this distinction between the codomain the set where they were not into where the image is Liv and the actual set of all possible images. You might not hit everything in the kodo me if you actually do hit everything in the codomain the function is called on to another fancy word for it. By the way, is it surjective but we're going to stick with the easier to pronounce function in other words.  for every B  in the codomain RM  there is  at least one  X in the domain  food images be  okay.  soap and an owl noting that  a linear transformation  is always a matrix transformation. So it has some Matrix a and is given by T of x equals ax.  Alternative for everybody in the codomain for everybody and RM there is at least one X in RN such that ax equals B.  Mexico's be as a matrix equation kind of we started starting two weeks ago.  And this statement that for every B, there's an X such that.  I'm sorry.  Someone said something out loud, but I didn't hear what it was. Yes.  Is consistent perfect exactly. This is the statement that ax equals B is consistent for every B.  Are we actually have to figure out how that when that strip? So this is already something that you know how to verify okay, but the important thing is the concept of self that equals B can always be solved. That's a statement about the function T about the transformation T. It's a whole codomain is hit by at least one might be more than one in. The statement is the statement that the first possibility that dichotomy doesn't happen 40. It's always consistent, but there might be more than one solution.  For any V?  No one to one is kind of a reverse of that. It's not the opposite. It's it's not that you can't be one to one of your on too many or both. But onto is the removal of the third line instead of the First Transformation is called.  if  text of x equals V.  has at most one solution  For any B.  Okay, so that means in the function kind of picture in the grass kind of picture. It means the T satisfies the horizontal line test in the vertical line test horizontal line test test if I take any be in its range and I look at the set of all X that get maps to be that's just a single point. There's only one point to be able to function we saw on the first day where there are lots of values that get hit twice over here in over here. That's not one to one but a function that is one to one means that for anything actually wants so again thinking about  The fact that linear Transformations are Matrix equation. So this is the statement that for any B.  ax equals B  Is either consistent?  Is that inconsistent?  Solutions or has a unique solution  So the trichotomy is your other have no Solutions one solution or infinitely many means that for anybody that system has only the first two possible has no Solutions in my bank insisted. That's okay if it has a solution there's only one.  Now I got that something we know how to recognize from the system of equations from The Matrix. What it means is when you do the row reduction, it means well at the bottom end and it isn't like I said, but if you don't know, how can you recognize that's true in a system of equations. What what is it that's has to be lacking if you want to have only one solution.  free variables quiz Matrix is a  directions 121 statement means that the coefficient Matrix has all columns pivotal.  It means it when you write down the system may be.  you find that there are no free variables which isn't a statement about be right that.  So these are the ideas onto and one-to-one onto means that ax equals B always has a solution for every be that there might be many.  Always has at most one solution. It may not have a solution. But if it does all that mean this is consistent for every B.  And we can recognize that again in the reduced in the rush. One form of a remember what the condition is 4X equals V to be always consistent someone on the side of the room.  Maybe not someone in the middle of the room.  There's no pivot in the augmented column. Does that mean the x equals B is always consistent. Remember the augmented column is where B lives so that's going to be a statement about be so that's not the right condition that says something else. What does that one? Say when a when there is a pivot in the in the last of method column that says that the system is inconsistent, right? That's that's an important condition but not going there was a hand over here behind you.  Every rose has a pivot. That's correct. Okay, if you want a sequel to be to be solvable for every be if you want there to be a solution for everything because if there are you going to be able to arrange it with some in the registration form that last row with the augmented Matrix. These are things that are now going to be easy to actually recognize how can you tell if a matrix transformation a linear transformation is one to one?  It's 121 precisely if there are no free variables every column is pivotal, how can you tell if it's on to you check to see if all the rows of the coefficient Matrix a r capital?  Crap is a pivot in every row transformation is a matrix transformation.  This Matrix is 2 by 3. That means that this is a linear transformation from R3 to R2.  I said this goes from R3 to R2.  Okay, so I want to answer the two questions. Is this guy one to one is it onto?  So to answer those questions as we just said we need to look at.  But I've been kind here. I've given you a matrix that happens to already be in row Echelon form. So we should be able to answer questions right away first question about being on to that's the statement. So this is a equals B has a solution for everything and Rush landform every route is pivotal. So every row  It's pivotal.  therefore T is onto  okay. Now we need to check if it's 1 2 1 1 2 1 is the statements at x equals B has no solution or a unique solution which has we said is a statement that there are no free variables in the system. There be no free variables and that means we're looking for every column to be pivotal.  Is every column here pivotal?  No, and actually we don't even need to look at the reduced row Echelon form or anything for this Matrix. We already knew that just from the size this Matrix has more columns and rows.  There are two rows that means there can't be any more than two pivots because it's only two rows but that means that one of us will not have a pivot in it. So it's the third one.  this column  is not pivotal.  They're 40 is not one to one.  That example might give you the mistaken impression that one to one and onto or opposing factors right that if your one-to-one you can't be onto if you're onto you can't be one to one. That's not true.  There's something else going on here that makes it like that in this example. We know that if you have a matrix that is wider than it is tall. Then the columns can't always have it all by the same argument. We just means that if you have a matrix is wider than it is tall. It's never going to correspond to a one-to-one later transformation. It might be onto like this one or it might not that's a question of whether there any rows of zeros at the bottom in a row Echelon. So it's true that this kind of guy can never be one to one. That doesn't mean you can't be both one-to-one and onto so for example, every rotation every rotation in any Dimension is both one-to-one and onto it's a one-to-one for a rotation means that okay. Look I got my Rotation by 45 degrees.  Taken out. So here I'm telling you. Here's a vector and I got it by rotating 45\u00b0. What's the set of all vectors that it could have been back 45 degrees. I can go in reverse and it's because every Vector comes from some vector by rotation again because I can go in reverse being one to one and onto means that you can reverse the land transformation has an inverse and we'll get to that next week.  It's possible to be one and not the other like in this example here. It's also so it's possible to be onto but not one to one. It's also possible to be one to one and not onto so here's an example of  First of all, let's check to see if it's on like before being on two means that there's a row there's a pivot in every row with Manny calculation. Is there a pivot in every row know because there's more rows and columns so they're just can't dogs enough tivitz to go around no pivot in one row and at least one row  Therefore they're forty is not onto.  No, that doesn't mean that it might also fail to B12 want there are lots of linear Transformations that are neither one to one or onto. What's the condition for checking if we need to see the every column is pivotal.  So to check that we would probably have to do production here.  only one step up two steps of it, but actually we don't need to because the concept of linear Independence means that two vectors are and vectors are linearly independent if there's no no  But we boiled that down to what it said about the Matrix his columns are those vectors and saw that linear Independence means?  The Columns are all pivotal.  But that's also the condition zero.  Connecting all the concepts we've done in the last couple of weeks nearly independent.  No in general if you want to check for The Columns of a matrix is linearly independent do the same thing you do any Quest.  How great it was actually but there's a special case that we talked about. If you have nearly independent linearly dependent linearly dependent person have 2 X 3 in the first component, but if I don't get five.  Therefore they are linearly independent there for all columns.  are pivotal  And therefore T is one to one.  So that's it. We connected all of the concepts together. So let's just finish paying its Matrix is a matrix is a  so that is only if  the rose of a  Are all pivotal.  Which is the same thing as saying that ax equals B has is consistent.  for every B  Auntie is one-to-one, if and only if the columns  of a  are all pivotal.  accidentally move this down to make a little little more space here The Columns of a are all pivotal which is the same thing as saying that the columns  Of a are linearly independent.  And then the third statement I wanted to make up here the rose of a are all pivotal. That's the same thing as being that the columns.  of a span RN around the output space  Okay, if you look back in your notes from to lecture to go that's what we said. So there we have it one to one and onto function Concepts, but their new language for the same questions. We've been answering using the same tools row reduction. Have a good weekend. See you in. "
