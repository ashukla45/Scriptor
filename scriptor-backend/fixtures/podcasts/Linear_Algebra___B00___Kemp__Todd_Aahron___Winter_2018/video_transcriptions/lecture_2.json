Please continue. If you are enrolled in the class, you're already on Piazza. If you are on the waitlist that you haven't been automatically enroll yourself on the course. I see that many of you have started working on the MyMathLab homework. That's great. Then if you have not you should start as soon as possible. I think a few people although is largely an other lecturers have had a bit of an issue technical issues with the system trying to get logged in if you are having problems go ahead and post on Piazza to help but largely your best bet is to go directly to the technical help page for Pearson and they can help you out usually but most of the time this has been working pretty smoothly. I would like to get started pretty quickly here over there is one more thing. I wanted to mention which I posted on the course webpage. So unfortunately there was a decoding error last time and the video feed did not get recorded. So you will not be able to watch Monday's lecture. You can still hear it the podcast if there was one lecture where the video was going to fail. The first one is the right one since more than half of it was spent just going through the course webpage what you can see anyway, so hopefully address the problem and will see today if the lecture is screencast to go before you but as usual I have posted the skeleton of the notes today already on the course webpage last night and I will post the complete lecture when we're done can use those resources as well when you're reviewing what we do today. Now I'd like to get started. So today we're going to be talking about section 1.2 topic, which is row reduction and row Echelon form or forms the next day. We'll move on to section 123, which is vector equation and just again as a reminder your first to MyMathLab homework says our do not this coming Monday, but the following Monday, January 22nd at 11:15 o by 11:59 p.m. And your first met lab homework assignment is due next Friday, January 19th. So let's get going.  So we'll continue where we left off last day. We're talking about solving systems of linear equations. And yesterday we focused for most of the lecture that we were working on it on in two unknowns, which is simple enough situation that you don't need any tools. You can just sort of do it with elbow grease you can do it by hand without worrying too much and no matter how you doing. It's going to work out. Okay, as long as you're careful enough, but you have so as I mentioned back substitution method. Well, if you're careful about it will always work is typically not the way to go with larger systems the better way which is to use arithmetic operations on the equations and add and subtract multiples of the equations from each other to simplify them.  But you can't just do that run until you have to do it with purpose. You have to figure out what should I add and subtract in order to simplify these things and what does it mean to simplify them? So the operation that we did last day was to say, alright, let's take  The first equation and the third equation. Let's look at those two right now.  And let's decide to add.  Or I should say to the ad - 5.  X the first equation  to the third equation and the replace the third equation with that new equation. We're adding and subtracting multiples of equations to each other the equality signs are all staying.  Valid so what do we do this? We're not going to change the solution. And the reason why multiplying that first one up there by -5 is because when I do so I'm going to go to -5 x 1 + 5x one and those two are going to cancel each other. So when I when I do that, maybe I'll actually write that first one x - 5 over here so it becomes - 5 x 1  + 10 x 2  -5 x 3 equals 0  and when I add that to the third equation  the minus 5x one canceled the 5x one.  Giving me a zero there and then I get a 10 x 2 when there was no X20 S2 before so I get + 10 x 2 and I have - 5 x 3 - 5 x 3 Soviet - 10 x 3 equals 0 + 10 or 10 equation with this new one down there.  It's debatable whether the one that I've written there is any simpler than what I had before it's still an equation for two of the unknowns that have an isolated in the equations yet. But now I've got the bottom two equations 2 x 2 - 8X 3 + 8 + 10 x 2 - 10 x 3 equals 10 those two equations if I ignore the first one those are two equations for the two so I could do those two and find the solution or Solutions.  Okay. No, I'm not going to I'm not going to do that here. I mean I am going to do it in the moment, but I'm going to first streamline the process that we just went through because it took a whole bunch of writing to do that writing that we don't need to do we can be more efficient about this and say look there's just no reason to keep writing X1 X2 X3 equals Sun.  We can keep those in our mind the arithmetic operations we needed to do I can just do on the coefficients. So I'm going to distill the system of equations into a new representative form here called an augmented Matrix.  Hey, I'm all that is is I take the coefficient of the variable that's one X2 and X3 and put those in this profession of that means of 0 course and then on the right hand side of that line. I put the numbers that are on the right hand side of the equation Square Matrix same number of equations is unknown. I could have 7 equations in 76 unknowns and that would not be a square. It would be a tall skinny rectangle.  Hey, we won't do such an example in this room. That would take a while, but you can certainly have it. So that square Matrix there to the left of the dash line is sometimes called the whole thing together is the augmented Matrix question.  No, that's a great question. So I'm drawing the dust line because that's the way I learned it when I took this class a little while ago and I like the reminder when you are presented with a matrix and told it is the augmented Matrix you always assume that the right-hand column is the stuff that's on the right of the equal sign always represents what's on the right hand side of the equal sign. Thanks. Let me redo the same calculation we just did.  Above butt on The Matrix if that's what we're going to be doing here. So I'm going to replace this Matrix with a new one.  And exact same operation but instead of equations, we now have Rose. Okay, so I'm going to call these Row 1 Row 2 and Row 3. What we did was we took - 5 * row 103 and put that result forward.  the same coefficients  in the first two rows  and then in the third row, we do the same operation - 5 * 1 + 5 is 0 - 5 x - 2 + 0 is + 10 + -5 - 5 is -10 + 0 + 10 + 10  Okay, so it's exact same calculation.  Just less writing.  And now I'm going to keep going. Okay. So my ultimate goal is to solve the system or figure out if it has a unique solution or if it has if in the many solutions or if it doesn't it or if it's inconsistent, those are my options exactly what I just said, I'm going to say in the first, second or third row. Is there zeros in the First Column there which means that X1 has been eliminated from those two equations. Just going to treat it as if it were a system of the last date, but again that are consistent efficient thing to do is not the back row operations. What I'm going to do a taxi, there's a bunch of things I could do.  Okay, I could say well actually let's simplify these let's go ahead and do to the following operation. I could say look. How about I divide through the second row by  I could have done that to start up there. I could have said well that second equation 2 x 2 minutes 8 x 3 equals 8 really would be simpler if I divided through by 2 and I get x 2 - 4 x 3 + 4 it's the same statement with a slightly less efficient statements that they're so let's let's do that. So what I'm doing is I am multiplying Row 2 by 1/2 and putting the results in Row 2.  Okay, and let me combine and not have to write too much. Let me do a similar thing at the same time to Row 3 Let's divide 3 by 10 there since everything is a multiple of 10 there. So I'll divide 403 by 10 and put the result and Rowe Street.  Okay.  That didn't simplify things too much but it's going to make the next arithmetic steps a little simpler. So I want to isolate the variable x 3 right now. I've got two strikes to an X3, but I can isolate X3 by taking some combinations of the last two rows there by taking an adding or subtracting multiple. What should I do to the second two rows to isolate x 3  Should subtract those rows from each other and put the results in Karnataka.  Okay, so let's do that if I take  Row 3 and subtract Metro 2 and put the results in Roastery. There aren't going to do anything. That's one of the great things about having his hair was there those ones are going to cancel.  and then I have - 1 - - 4 - 1 + 4 which is 3  I finally I have 1-4.  Which is -3 there.  To be clear. What I'm doing is adding and subtracting equations. I'm not using the notation of the equations.  And this new system of equations that this equivalent.  So the solution set of this system is the same as the solution set of the original one.  But this one now, well, you tell me.  I'm going to tell you that or I'm telling you that this system is now recognizably in a position where we can say, yes. This has a unique solution.  There's exactly one solution the system, but I can look at that form of that Matrix and say yes, there is a unique solution. Yes back row.  Okay. Yes, that's that's a good explanation. So we could do one more step during divide through Row 3 by 3 and then we would get 0-0 1-1 and what that says that equation is x 3 + - 1 solve for x 3 and it has only one value it can take I know if we if we look it up from there if we back substitute the second equation is an equation for x 2 and x 3 but now we know what X3 is. So that's going to be a single equation for x 2 y X1 X2 and X3 FedEx max player now fixed constants. Are we going to be able to let you know that there is going to be a unique solution know. How could we tell that? What was it that we saw there?  What we saw is this.  What we saw is that we got the special form here that actually it's not just that it's this and this.  So the yellow is on was called the diagonal of the square Matrix and the orange stuff below it. By the way, I forgive me. I'm color-blind. If I say a color name that you didn't think was a color that was there. You're probably right and I'm wrong so are all nonzero numbers to this form, you know, you're going to be able to finish that, you know, you going to be able to solve for the bottom variable and then back substitute your way up. You don't know what the solution is.  Okay, so we're going to get to so that's an example of an Echelon forms, very old-fashioned 19 century word Echelon form. Once you get to a phone like that, if you can get your phone like that, you know, you're going to be able to solve the system is going to be consistent and have a unique solution.  Okay. No we can do I just set into back substitution to fish from there or we could continue with row operations adding and subtracting column rows from each other in order to to finish solving system. That way I'm going to give myself a little more space and go over here now. So first things first, let me go ahead right there and divides True by  Three to get that one there. I know what I'm going to do is say oh, well, I'd like to get I'd like to Iceland next to now.  But I want to get rid of the extra part of it so I can do that by adding some multiples of those second and third rows to each other. What should I do?  Someone from this side of the room.  I want to add some multiples of Rose two and three together to get rid of the X 3 dependents in the second row.  I multiply 404 by 303 by 4 and add that to row but the results in Row 2.  So the beauty is that when I do any operations between the two rows affect the first column in any way because  that's what's great about those euros and this operation. I just said which is to take four times Row 3.  Added to Row 2 and put the result in Row 2 because there's a zero.  Hey, but we did was designed this so that 4 * 1 - 400 there.  And now we're also multiplying by 4 and adding up there. We're going to get a zero here as well.  Okay.  I now have isolated next to that equation now says X2 is equal to 0 that second row there.  And now I want to isolate X1 so I can do that by continuing with these row operations.  So I want to get rid of everything but the X1 in that first row. I want to get rid of the -2 on the one by doing these row operations.  Why can't get rid of them both simultaneously, but I've got a 1 below the -2 I can use and I've got a one in the third row below the one I can use so I do each of those and turn and because there's so many zeros around the other coefficients are just not going to get affected so we can do this elimination.  get up with the echelon form is good for  so what I'll do is I will subtract the third row.  from the first row  and put the results in the first row.  and when I do that  I'm going to get a zero here.  and -1 subtracted from 0 is 1  and then I'm also said there's no reason to write too much of this. I'll do it simultaneously. I'm now going to add twice the second row.  To the first row in put the results in the first row and that's going to get rid of that -2 for me.  So the second operation here is now going to get rid of that -2 for me.  It's not going to suck that they're over there and it's going to knock on effect this one because Row 2 had a zero there.  And now look at the form of the Matrix year.  It's 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1. So what that says is that these equations down here translating back these equations say  x 1 + 0 + 0 equals 1 x 2  is equal to 0 + x 3 is equal to -1 and now I've solved my system there is the unique solution.  Unless I made a numerical error, which is always quite possible.  Although you're also learning Matlab now, which is much better.  Right, so there is a full implementation of the row reduction algorithm. So what we used  whereas I said row operations  the three kinds of row operations that we saw their operation one was to take some row.  01 / some nonzero number which I'll call P and put the result back in that same row. That's one kind of operation and the other kind of operation. We saw here was to take some row. Maybe it was road to I don't know X some number.  Add that to another row. Let's say row by Row 3 and put the results in Row 3.  Kinds of operations that are totally valid if they preserve the quality. I don't use only those operations and converted our system to one that had the variables totally isolated.  There is a third kind of row operation that we didn't use in this example.  And it's kind of a silly one.  Something we could have done was to say let's just swap to Rose. Maybe I'll reverse the first and second remove the second row into the first row in the first row in his second row position that corresponds to an original system would be in a different order.  And we'll see on the next slide an example where it might be necessary to do that in order to follow the algorithm that we were just implementing.  All right.  So here's an example.  What's the first thing we should do?  someone from The Middle  Yes.  right  Stop X 1X 2x 3x equals sign as an augmented Matrix.  to save ourselves lots of trouble  Okay now.  What we did last time was to say what we'd like to do is first to figure out whether it has a solution or not is to get it into that Echelon form where we have zeros below.  Play that's what we mean by isolating and its algorithm.  But there are witches that does a zero.  Cancel that first if we got zeroes, but then we wouldn't have X1 in the equation anymore at all. But actually what that means is that we can't because there's a zero there where it will be necessary Third Kind of operation.  Okay. So let's swap two of the Rose. Let's swap the first in the second row.  And make sure to carry everything in the row when you don't move some of the numbers but not the others.  Okay, I know.  There's a nonzero entry in that on the diagonal in the first part right there all operations. Okay, if I do operation here and you didn't follow what I did ask me to write it down for you when you're doing this for yourself as you're practicing. It's a great idea to write down the row operations these three row operations down here. They have to be in order for this to be a valid operation.  So I could if I ever wanted this and swap to Rose, I could stop them back and get back to the original system. I can reverse that first operation there if I had divided Row 1 by 7, I could get back to the original row by dividing that first row by 1/7 operation. And this one is also reversible just have to subtract from it a times are too and put the result in roaster and all through these operations are reversible you can and that and that has to be the case of two row equivalent. They represent the same system of equations that you have to be able to go back from the 2nd to the 1st as well.  Okay. So anyway, we've done one row operation here now. Our goal is to in the first phase of this other of them is to get zeros below. We have to get rid of this for somehow so that we can do that which is 2 * -2 and add it to the fourth row. So let's do that. So I'll leave the first two rows on touch.  And If I multiply the first row by -2 and add it to the third row that gives me my desired 0 there.  now - 2 x - 3 is 6 I add that to -8 and I get -2  and 2 * -2 is -412.  + 1 x - 2 - 2 add that to the wind when I get mine at 1.  So now I have zero.  Now if I want to get it to that Echelon form where I have zeros all below the diagonal.  I need to get rid of the minus 2 below the one there and I can do that by what what what operation should I do now?  Yes.  Multiply Row 2 x 2 and add that to the Roasterie and put the result in Roastery.  Okay, so that zero is unaffected. I multiply the one by 2 and add it to Row 3 that gives me the zero I was hoping for their and I multiply that -4 by 2 and added to the ATM that gives me 0 there and 8 * 15.  That's interesting. So this is an Echelon form we have zero is below the main diagonal.  But we have an extra zero here on the back. What does that mean?  I Lost You by show of hands  Yes, so let's think what this equation with this row represents. It represents the equation down here 0 equals 15 to 0 equal 15. Okay. So we have arrived at a contradiction and that tells us that  There are no Solutions. This system is inconsistent.  That was easy. Okay, the first the way it was presented to us at first, there's no hope of looking at it, but it just required three row operation Operation follow a particular algorithm examples.  And the great thing is here. We don't need to go any further there.  with the highlighting  Oh, we could tell that the system would have a unique solution when we got that we had to do a few more steps in order to find the solution, but we could figure out the status of equations in this example. There's no reason at all to go any further to do any more row operations because  So here's let's do another question.  I'm sorry.  Yes, this Matrix is that there is in a row Echelon form and into more slides while out precisely defined those ideas and you'll see what I mean. You can tell the status of the solution set point special on form is one from which you can look at it, and I know the answer to that question.  question  exactly after further operations say 0 equals 38, but that's a great example of great points here if it had turned out.  That the The Matrix we got here was this instead?  Then we could also conclude something an in this form we can we can conclude the full statement.  Which is the third equation there actually was extraneous information. It was a consequence of the other two because it reduces just 0 equal 0 and 3 unknown and the Matrix is still in Echelon form.  So we have nonzero. Oops. We have nonzero entries here.  Okay, so that those two equations say the second one says x 2 - x 4 equals 8 and the first one says 2 x 1 - 3 x 2 + 2 2x 3 we could simplify things a little Beyond there and we'll get to that in a few minutes but fundamentally what it says is there isn't enough information to solve this system completely in other words there isn't so if you get to the point where one of your equations when you're answering the question of what is the status of the solution set and conclude there infinitely many solutions.  Then there was one more question down here before or has it already been answered.  Has been answered.  All right. Great. Maybe I should write down what I just said. It has infinitely many solutions.  Okay, so here's an example which is a couple of examples which are similar to things that you see on your homework equations there.  Tell me if this system is consistent or not. Let's take a boat. Actually how many people think that system is consistent?  Okay, how many people think it's inconsistent?  Slightly more of you people have no idea what's going on.  Thank you for your honesty, sir.  All right. Well, so let's let's look at this together. So in this case there were most of you didn't come out to vote. That's bad. You should come out and exercise your right to vote whether you're right or not. Anyone who voted for consistent like to explain why they said it was  Exactly. So we've gotten it into an Echelon form and there are nonzero entries on the bag. What we did today was democracy failed. But whether you were right this guy said yeah, that's the key here once you get a matrix in this form.  Weather are zeros below that. And you have nonzero entries on the diagonal. You can immediately the system is consistent. I know there will be a solution.  All right, and if you wanted to find that solution you need to do a few more steps of production to eliminate the coefficients above and then you'll have isolated the variable.  Alright, here's another example, which is similar to problems that you'll see on the question.  Well 5 dozen equal 0 but that's not what that third equation there says. We have to remember how we did the translation.  that equation says 5 x 3 equals 0  the problem would have been if it were at 0 and 5.  So the order of the colors matters, thank you very much for pointing that out because you're just explained why I'm going to pretend that I put this to elicit that thought because I'm sure many people were thinking the same thing, but that's a great example to understand how you need to master the translation here. Remember what it actually says, so it's true that the order of the column has a different meaning than the other column which is why I like to put that dotted line there to remind myself of that fact.  Was there another hand I think I saw another yes.  No consistent just reminder for my stay consistent means there is at least one solution no solution at all. So you're right that we actually have more information here. In this case. We have yes, it is consistent and the solution is unique.  All right. So let's look at this next example here which is similar to one that's on your homework for this week.  So here I have a system of equations equations in two variables think of them as numbers. I just haven't told you what those numbers are so they might be three and seven just a system of two equations for which values of H&K is the system consistent. So they'll be some H&K for which there is a solution.  Find a which characterize which Asian K have that property if there are any are there any for which there's a unique solution some of those H&K. Maybe they'll be a unique solution.  So, how are we going to answer this question?  All right. Well, let me let me explain to you the answer to every question in. This course is the same row reduction. Are we going to answer this question?  Okay, not bad about the end of the quarter. I wanted to be much more enthusiastic.  So we're going to proceed to try to solve the system has unknown numbers H&K over there.  We write down the augmented Matrix for the system -1 and H and it's -6 3K.  And now we want to use row operations to carry this to an Echelon form in the lower left-hand corner so we can do that.  by multiplying the first row by  3 so I'll write the operation in this case. So I must by the first row by three added to the second row and put the result in the second row. So that doesn't touch the first row.  By design a zero there now if I multiply -1 by 3 and also get a zero.  Okay. So what I've done is to multiply the first row by 3, so that's three are added to the second.  and now  I contend that I can completely answer both questions just by looking at that because this one step at what we just did. So in the spirit of the last question that was asked about the previous example, let's rewrite the equation that that third row for the second row represent 1 + 0 is equal to 3 H + K.  Is that equation true?  I'm tired of different answers.  Yes, how about how about no is that equation false?  Okay. So now we have to have a deep philosophical discussion about the notion of Truth. So maybe maybe  I know there are some H&K for which is true and some H&K for which is false and that is exactly  3 H + k equals 0  Then the system.  consistent  because that second question just says 0 equal 0 in that case and the first equations and has infinitely many solutions.  3 H + K is not equal to zero.  Then the system.  is  inconsistent  because that equation says 0 equals 43 or whatever number it's Christmas Day is which I've decided is not zero in that case.  Looking back to the original question for which H&K is the system consistent. The answer is the exact description of those H&K are the set of all H&K for 3 H. + k equals 0 equals 1 + 2 equals -3 is an example of a pair has  H&K Solutions  okay, so the answer that first question is  that this is consistent if and only if this term and only if this happens exactly 3 H + k equals 0  now, what about the second one for which H&K is there a unique solution?  I have an idea for which H&K is there a unique?  Exactly because we just established the dichotomy down here either straight. There are no Solutions. There's no room in the middle for there to be a unique solution.  Well in this case.  There aren't enough equations to pin down a single solution at the end of the day. We're left with Jason. So there are infinitely many solutions to answer your question why generality let's turn to the next slide where we finally will get to this notion of echelon form more precisely when you can tell once you get your Matrix into Echelon form, okay, so these two matrices here are the top bar in Asheville on form, and I wanted to just first specify some language.  It will use in describing what a salon for means. So whenever you have any Matrix that all entries in each row. So in in the first example of here, I'm going to highlight the leading entries.  And I'm going to do so over here as well.  So those are the leading entries of your Matrix at any given stage.  Deleting entries are the first non-zero entry in each row. So in the first row, the first non-zero entry is the two right there in the one 1 entry in the second row. The first ones are interested to to entry and in the third row on that first example, their first nuns are entry is actually in the rightmost column and we've already seen by the way, this is Matrix, then that third row represents the equation 0 equals 5/2, which is an inconsistent equation so we can tell what's on the left vs. Right of that died line on the right hand side. The leading entries are all on that main diagonal.  Okay, so that's what leading entry means the first non Zero Entry in a given row is the leading entry in that row.  So here is what in row Echelon form means.  Is in row Echelon form if it looks like this that is to say what I've done is put little green boxes in the leading entries of this Matrix is the first non-zero in Chinese row. So everything to the left of each of those boxed countries is zero.  I noticed that in this.  every entry below a leading entry is 0 the lower triangular part that I was talking about that has to be zero to be in Echelon form for parts only makes sense for a square Matrix, but this is a generalization everything below a leading entry is 0  And that's exactly what you can do with row operations. You can always use row operations to get zeros below by multiplying the row without hitting a tree by appropriate constants and adding it to cancel out the things.  Green's asterisks there just represent any numbers that are there to the right on form if you have zeros below the leading actress.  And once you have a matrix in a row Echelon form is a row Echelon form because I don't care what the leading entries are. They just have to be nonzero. They might be 7pi 28. So they're different different Rolex 1 forms, depending on what those constants are.  But once you're in a row Echelon form, you can figure out whether the system has one solution many solutions or no Solutions.  Because in this example here we have in row Echelon form at the bottom with God's.  Xgody how many zeros are in 7 plus something * x 8 plus something equals something it's possible those some of those we might have isolated X7 there. But there's just no way we're going to be able to isolate x 8 and x 9. There's no leaving entries corresponding to a third column. There were X3 would be there's no leaving entry for X3 going to be able to isolate it no matter how hard we try.  So in this case, there's no way we're going to have a unique solution and also because I've told you there's a leading entry in the last column there and it's not you know in the right color in the last not in the right column. We never see the equation 0 equals 15 coming up. There's no inconsistency so we can look at this form represents infantry many solutions.  Once we get to a row Echelon form, we can answer the question of the status of the solution set but we can't tell you what the solution is necessarily we have to go a little further than that. So that's what reduced row Echelon form is about. So let me show you what that is.  reduced row Echelon form would be if we get it now by 5 dividing through  we can always make those leading entries ones.  And when they're ones something else we can do is we can now use those to do the backward phase of the algorithm like we did in the operations to get zeros above deleting entries.  This Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form.  Where there are no nonzero entries other than the leading ones in the columns in which year means deleting entry in each row is a one and it's the only non Zero Entry in its column.  And in this one we can now say what the solution or solutions that is. I have reduced it to the simplest form possible now will get in too many examples like this in the next day, but let's just ignore the columns that are there that have no entries.  If there are still sore a diagonal like the examples that we saw that we would have isolated the variable if it's not of that form like this and we have some variables that haven't been isolated attempt the isolated then we're not going to have a unique solution. We're going to have infinitely many solutions. Let me go to the last flight here and just give you a couple more words as we finish here. So the here's an example of a matrix form. Okay, if you look at the leading and trees are here here and here.  It's in reduced row Echelon form because there are no nonzero entries in those column zeros above and below those wants.  And I cannot tell what the complete solution of this looks like that over there. So we have actually isolated X5 there but there's no way we can isolate x 3 x 4 and x 2 and x one from each other. They just satisfy these reduced equations. And that's all we can say that has the solutions of those reduced equations in there. Infinitely many solutions the variables that correspond to the leading one that is x 1 x 2 and x 5 those are called pivotal variables and then the remaining of variables.  That you just can't isolator called free variables. You can't pin down their value even in terms of other things. Those are the free variables through the other variables and that's how many solutions a parametrization of a line or a plane or something like that the describes the solution set continue with roachl on farms.
