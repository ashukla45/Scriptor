    "Full Transcript": "Do you want me to go through one of them and I'm going to open the floor to other questions if you want to do some of the other one, that's fine. Remember that? I teach to lectures. Whichever midterm. I doing this one other the other one the other lecture, they're both going to be posted on Piazza right after what can be posted on the podcast like right after class. So if you want to see solutions to the other one, you can go and watch that. I'll post them on the course website at about 1:30 p.m. As well after the two lectures so you can see the solutions there. Some of you have already been working out solutions back and forth on Piazza, which is great. Some of those Solutions are not correct. Some of them are people are discussing this and realize that's the way that I wanted this to happen cuz you going to learn a lot more from somebody else's discussion of why someone made a mistake then you would if I just tell you the right answer from the beginning Okay, so we're going to get start in a minute here. We're doing review today. Just to keep our eye on the ball. We are continuing on Friday with force with lecture material from section 2.2 and 2.3. So after the midterms tonight and tomorrow you're sitting at home bored, you're going to be reading the textbook for the next section as usual.  The midterm starts at 8 p.m. Tonight. It's in three different rooms Galbraith Hall 242 your call to 62 and your call to 722. Whichever room you are in is listed along with your seat number in that room on in code so that it's short enough so that while you're walking over to revelle college and load it on your phone. It will fully display on your phone pad. So G H is for Galbraith Y6 is for your call 6 to 62 + y 7 is for your call to 722 and your seat number is listed there if you get to the room and your earlier in the day, or if you are left-handed and would like a left-handed desk come talk to whoever is in charge in the room right away and we'll figure out a seat for you. We were going to start to show up at those rooms early.  Before that relax eat a good dinner. Maybe at least 2 hours in advance stretch. Don't try to study starting at 6 p.m. It's not going to is it going to stress you out like whatever studying you've done up until maybe earlier in the afternoon. That's that's where I cut it off.  You are allowed to bring one sheet of notes double-sided standard eight and a half by 11 sheet. Someone asked him if you have to if they can write it on their iPad and print it out. Yes, when I said handwritten. What I meant is I don't want you to type it in 3-point font and bring a magnifying glass. I want you to actually figure out what are the important things that are enough to fit only on that double sided sheet. You cannot bring any electronic devices are you can't have any electronic devices in on your desk? So your cell phone should be off and in your bag. If you're accustomed to using your cell phone as a timepiece, then you should be aware that you're not going to be able to do that and you have a lots and lots of time for this exam. So it shouldn't be a point of stress anyway.  You will write your exam answers on the exam sheet. Like I'm going to in a moment. Okay, don't bring a Blue Book for not using glue bugs because the exam sheets themselves will be taken and scanned into gradescope and grated there. Where you your time right away. As soon as it's graded. It will be graded by Friday. Please bring your UCSD student ID when you turn in exam and most importantly have fun tonight if that's the way I always look at exams. That's the way I want you to try to look at exam. Even if you're nervous about it. Try to make it into something try to make it into a game try to make it into something that you can have fun with and that's going to help you.  Get over any stress that you might feel about it. All right, so let's get going on actually working through one of these exams and actually so there were two that I posted and I think I'm going to go through the second one in this lecture. I'm going to go through this one.  Not you may be saying that's not the second one because I said it's version be up here. Actually, somebody asked on Piazza. There was one that said version and one that said version be not to be clear. Those were not two versions of the same exam. Those were two different exams Each of which had four versions. Okay. So someone asked if I can do version V instead of Virgin am sure I'm going to do that. It's very similar to the version that you guys were working on already. But some of the numbers are different if you want to see the actual solutions to the Virgin a that I posted you could look at the podcast from math 18 lecture see in Winter 2017 one year ago that I taught where I went through that it's version examined see the solutions there. Yes.  No, I'm talking about the one I'm about to do.  in the second lecture  Neither of these have I done exactly before cuz this is version V. And if you look on it 20-17 you're going to see version. Hey, okay.  Alright, so let's get started. So the first thing you need to do questions arose as carefully read and complete the instructions at the top of this exempt and any additional instructions in particular one of the instructions the most important instruction.  Is Write Your Name at the top of each page of this exam so that's what we're going to start by doing. Okay. You're going to write your name up here.  So there's my name and you going to write your student number whatever it is.  Okay, and then you're going to go through and you're going to write your name on each page.  I know it scares him groaning. That's a terrible terrible thing. I'm asking you to do and I'm so sorry about that.  Hey, I changed it up a bit each time. Okay, the reason is that  You know, we're going to keep his exams together, but when we scanned them, we're going to cut off the Staples and scan them in. It's possible that a page will get shuffled around somewhere else. We need all the tools at hand to find that page if it's traveled around in somewhere else in the stack somewhere else in this can the software is good at finding your sheets by your name. If your name isn't on that page is possible. We won't find it. So write your name on every page.  Okay, and then we'll start now you can of course the date questions in any order that you want. I'm going to go through in the order that they listed here. So his problem 1 consider the following system of linear equations. Is this the equations 2 equations 2 unknowns 3 equations and there's also an unknown parameter there H, you've done lots of problems just like this. We're going to try to solve the system or say something about the nature of the solution and how it depends on H2. The first part I asked find all values of H for which the system is consistent and describe the solution set for those age.  Okay, so when we see a problem like this, what do we do?  Excellent row reduction. So we're going to write down the augmented Matrix corresponding that system. I see one to one.  214 + 1 - 1 H operations to take this to row Echelon form. Actually we may as well go all the way to reduced row Echelon form cuz we're going to need that in order to answer the second part of the question describe the solution set. So let me try to be as clear as possible here. I'm going to write down the row operations that I'm using. So I'm going to subtract twice the first row from the second but the results in the second row giving me the desired 0 there.  Okay.  so that gives me  1 - 4 - 3 in this lot and 4-2 is two of them. But now I'm going to subtract the first row from the second row of try the third row and put the result in the third row to get the desired 0 underneath there.  Aquarium that gives me -3 here and H minus one there.  Okay, and now I've got I've got the leading entry where it needs to be in the second row, but I need to get rid of the minus 3 below that living in tree. So I'm going to subtract the second row from the third row, but the result in the third row.  and that will give me a 0 there and H -3 r  Now this Matrix is not in reduced row Echelon form, but it's in row Echelon form, which is already enough to answer the first part of the question, which is for which values of H. Is this consistent?  What do you think guys for which values of H. Is this consistent?  No, yes.  What are those two? Anyway, yes, that's correct. For which values? Is it inconsistent? All the others? Very good, if H is equal to 3 so it let's write this so we can now say if H is equal to  then this turns into Raichu. Let's right. This way is not equal to 3.  Last column is pivotal.  so inconsistent  Okay, so now so the answer is only H equals 3 gives us consistent. So now let's write down with this system looks like in the case of H equals 3.  I'm going to get 0 0 0 down there.  And now the Matrix is almost in reduced row Echelon form. Okay, we just need to do a couple more things. We need to Pivot that second row.  So I guess I won their I got a minus two thirds there.  and so I figured that second row divided by -3  I know I'm going to add I'm going to subtract twice the second row from the first row for the result in the first row.  That gives me the desired 0 there.  So I'm subtracting twice the second row I get - 2 * - 2/3 is 4/3 + 1 is 7/3.  + - 2/3 there  I know this Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form. And actually I can see that it has a unique solution. So the solution is x 1 x 2 is equal to 7/3 - 2/3.  No, I don't guarantee that I didn't make a numerical are there and if someone sees it please pointed out but if I did make a numerical are there and it says up there this problem is worth 6 points 6 points for all three parts so you can bet it's going to be about two points per part if I made a numerical are there, let's rewrite but I made an America down there. What are you going to get your going to get 1.5 out of 200 K. I'm not testing that you did the arithmetic right? I'm testing the you understand how to do the question you will lose some points if you make a mistake, but that's not the main thing that we're looking for here. Okay, cuz that's what I'm going to instruct the Tas.  Okay, find all values of H, which system is inconsistent? Well, we actually already wrote that up here and so we can say okay.  H equals H not equal to 3  and those are two points.  And finally is the corresponding homogeneous system consistent. If so, describe its solution set.  Okay. What do you think is the suppressor? What is meant by the corresponding homogeneous system. It means set all of these equal to zero. Is it consistent?  Yes, why?  San Michele. Yes. Tell me why.  Every homogeneous system always has the x equals zero solution perfect answer. So yes.  consistent  because  x equals 0 is a solution now. Is it the only solution or are there others?  Do we have to go through row operations again to answer that?  No, there's two ways. We could answer that during the work. We've already done one is to say look if I put all zeros down the augmented call him there. It's not as I did and that means when I go through the whole process here, by the way, the H doesn't have to be at 8 is not going to have to be three.  Operations on the right hand side will change right. So now it's now it's consistent for any age.  The as you noted here, but all the operations I did are going to remain the same and the only difference is that the augmented column is going to stay all zeros, which means going to be able to pick off. The solution is 1 x 2 equals 0 0 but more importantly we can say this is the only solution  the only solution because  in homogeneous 10in homogeneous version  of the system  has a unique.  particular solution  So remember we have that they're on which says take his and how much in your system if I can find it solution then if I have any in homogeneous version of that system, it will either be inconsistent or its solution will consist of the homogeneous system translated by some particular Vector. That means that if this version of this system has a unique solution just the particular solution of the system must be just a zero Factor.  Okay, so you could answer that in lots of different ways. You weren't even asked to justify this. So this is the only solution.  That this is the only solution.  And this part you'll get full points here. But if you want to be extra careful and write down a justification, then this would be a good justification.  Okay, that we go there was problem on full points unless I made an error which I don't think I did. So let's move on to problem 2.  Let a b this 3 by 3 Matrix find the reduced row Echelon form of a explicitly being asked to do so, let's do that.  We've already got a zero below the leading one in the first row. So we have to just listen to the 3rd row. I'm going to subtract 3 times the first row plus the third row.  But the result in the third row.  Okay, so that gives me the desired 0 down here.  How to subtract -3 * -1 - 3 * - 1 from Once that's OnePlus 3 gives me for here. And I have to subtract 9 from 5 giving me -4 here.  Okay. Now let me go ahead and prove it. So I'm going to go down here. I don't want to write over my name cuz then the computer will maybe have trouble recognizing I'm going to Pivot now. I'm divided Row 2 by 2 and divide 3 by 4.  And now I'm going to subtract the second row from the Third.  Take me to the desired 0 there and I get a -2 here. I'm going to have it again.  Now I'm going to subtract.  the third row from the second  but the results in the second row.  Actually, let me not do what I just did to the first row cuz I'll save space.  And I'll symbol taneously subtract 3 times the third row from the first row.  Cancel that doesn't affect that one. It does affect the -1 that doesn't affect them as one cuz of the zero there and we get the desired 0 there and then there's just one more step which is to add a second row to the first row and put the results in the first row.  and that gives me  fat  and I guess the identity Matrix unless I made a mistake. Yes.  So you're saying that I should get a positive for in the lower right-hand corner of after the first step. So what was I doing? So that means I thinking -3 * 3  what's -9 and adding it to 5 that gives me -4  Let's see the second entry. I'm supposed to be subtracting - 3 that's supposed to be adding - 3 * - 121 that gives me a positive for so if what you said was correct. If it should have been a positive for there that we would have gotten a different answer down here, but it looks to me like we haven't made an error here, but please find out if we if you see one.  On the forms. I'm sorry.  I can't hear you. I'm sorry.  Yes, I said this is version B and the one I posted was version a so if you want to see the solution spelled out for a version a you can go to the podcast from 9:15 lecture see in Winter 2017 and see me do this for that person and that link is in Piazza. Let's assume that this was correct. And we're supposed to describe the solution set of the homogeneous equation ax equals 0. What is the solution set look like?  It's ax equals 000. Correct? Because right here every column.  is pivotal  that means that there'll be a unique solution when one exists at all, and we know that there is a solution because it's homogeneous.  okay, how about  if we take the vector v equals 111 is this equation x equals be consistent and if so describe the solution set o we should have looked at the whole question first because what do we have to do now?  We have to do it again. But with this augmented call of a text. So that's a good lesson to us. We should read the whole question before we start so we can answer the first part is the equation consistent. Yes or no. Yes, because when we carry the whole thing to reduced row Echelon form  We're going to get dissed. We're going to get this right here as the reduced row Echelon form of the coefficient Matrix exactly the same steps.  Okay, so that means that we're going to get a unique solution. But what is that unique Solution that's going to depend on what happens to the vector be during these row operations. They so we have to repeat it again, unfortunately, so if it's something like this happens on the exam read the whole question first, and then you could have just done Part D first and then answered Part II after work without having to do any more work. Okay. So let's start again 1 - 1/3  011  and 0 1-1 and now we have to put this one one one over there.  Oh gosh. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm copying the wrong Matrix down there. Okay, let's  And there's a common mistakes that you could make I'm totally making all of these mistakes on purpose just to show you what not to do guys. Totally. Absolutely.  at 1:03  -1 to 1  and three to five  With a 111. Okay. Now if you want we can do exact steps. I just follow a routine from above I'm going to reproduce them again cuz they'll be the same steps. So I'm going to subtract three times the first row from the third giving me the desired zero down there and that gives me a for here and a -4 there and it gives me a -2 here.  So that's the key thing we need to keep track of now is what happens to the bee vector?  Now I'm going to prove it like I did before that's going to give me 0 1 - 1 - 1/2 down here 011 and positive 1/2 here and 1 - 131 there now. I'm going to subtract.  the second row from the Third  Can you give me a -2 there and I'm subtracting - 1/2 from - 1/2 at this mean minus one there.  All right, and now I'll pivots.  Could I have the one there?  And 1/2 there.  Now I'll subtract the third row from the second.  I guess meme zero and that's a lot. That's nice.  And now I'll subtract the third row from the first I could have come by in these into to one step like we didn't up above but I'll just do it separately and that gives me so I'm going to subtract 3 and three times the third row to the first.  0 there  + 3 * 1/2 + 3/2 + 1 is 5/2 of there.  100 and half and then one more step and we're done.  which is to add the second row to the first giving me the decides there or their  and that doesn't do anything to the five halves because there was a zero in the second row. So there is our solution two solutions that  is  the solution set is x equals 5/2 0 1/2  How many mistakes did I make?  What I did was to copy wrong.  Great.  I totally made this mistake on purpose. Okay, so that was supposed to be a positive Street there. So that means that what we did in the next step which was to at we added three Witch of subtracted three times the second so that means is 5/2 what's wrong at that point. So we we should have subtracted three times the third row from the first time is 1 - 3/2 that gives us some - 1/2 there and that means and the last step again nothing changes because they're so I think the solution is supposed to be minus 1/2 0 1/2 how many mistakes account?  Okay, I think this is correct.  And again, this is testing that you can do row reduction. So if you did all of this and you wrote down your steps and you got an answer that had a slightly wrong number and if you're not going to lose that many points again, this was worth 6 points and if there was a numerical error that you know propagated from parte DE parts, but you got the form of the answer right then you're going to get at least for four and a half out of six. Yes.  Which we will not lose points if you don't write down your steps, but if you make a mistake, it's going to be a lot harder for the greater to track where it happened. If you don't write down your steps, so write down your steps if you can and it's going to help you.  All right, so that was problem to that one was a bit gross to be out. If you ask me. That one was more writing than I would like to see on an exam. Okay, I didn't write this.  But it's testing things that you need to be able to do the whole problem first to see if there's something we should do for parte that we're going to do in parts to save ourselves to writing. So we're given a list of three vectors unknown at the moment at 31 k  For each of Parts a through C find values of K for which this has the indicated property are the three indicated properties were looking for for which day is the start of linearly independent for which side effect of which for which values of K is this set linearly dependent and for which values of K. Is this set of 3 vectors A spanning set for witch that does it for which day does it spend all of our three?  Okay. Now first first thing we should notice. Hey, I remember that linear Independence and linear dependence are just off of it properties linear Independence means not linearly dependent. So once I know how to say I know how to answer. Vice versa part C is about us or three that's a different property. But actually all three of these can be answered from the same form, which is we need to take the Matrix with these three vectors of columns, and we need to get it to row Echelon form. We don't need to go all the way to reduce Rush one form. But if we go to row Echelon form will be able to see how many columns are pivotal and how many rows are pivotal and those  Answers allow us to answer these three parts. So let's do that.  Okay. So first thing I'm going to do is subtract the first row from the second. I'm going to not follow my own advice. I'm not going to write down my operations what I'm doing here when I say them out loud instead don't do as I do do as I say and write down your row operations. So that gives me a zero here to here and mine is to there.  And I'm going to subtract the first row from the third giving me zero hear another zero there and K - 3 there.  And you know what we can stop here.  This Matrix is in row Echelon form.  We could go to register Exxon phone. It's going to get a little nasty cuz we're going to / K - 3 but thinking about that that already tells us what kind of value of K is going to have a different Behavior than others.  when can we not / K - 3  when K - 3 is 0 my high school math teacher always used to say if thou / 0. Shall receive one so we can't divide by zero and that indicates if K is equal to 3 so that the behaviors can be different if we try to continue with raw operations. Really what it means is we can recognize what's going on here.  So if k equals 3.  Then this Matrix is 11302 - 2 + 000.  That tells us that the pivotal Rose.  Are the first two dates have a pivot entry and the pivotal columns are the first two but the last call up in the last row are non pivotal.  non pivotal  and non pivotal  if K is not equal to 3.  Then we get this Matrix here and we see that all rows and all columns.  are pivotal  many people ask this question on Piazza yesterday cuz they're still struggling a little bit with these words. What does it mean for a row to be pivotal once again reminder the definitions?  You carry a matrix to row Echelon form.  And then you look for the leading entries in the Rosa leading entries the first non Zero Entry reading from left to right that's called a leading entry in a row Echelon form.  Column is called pivotal if it contains the leading entry. So in this first example here, right the First Column it contains the leading entry in the first route. So the First Column is pivotal.  The second row is living at Rita's in the second column for the second column is pivotal, but the third column there it has no leading entries in it. Cuz leading actor in the first row is not in the third column to the first and second row is not in the third column. It's in the second and the third row doesn't have a meeting at 3. So the third column is not pivotal.  That similarly it's hard to talk about which rows are pivotal in the original Matrix because row operations could involve Rose Place with her change with rose have what properties but we can say that there is at least one row that isn't pivotal because he doesn't have a meeting at three in a row Echelon form.  Okay. Anyway, now we know what happened to answer the question. So when is the set of vectors linearly independent? We have a serum that tells us what's the answer. How can we tell if vectors are linearly independent?  Someone raised a hand to tell me.  Any of you know the answer cuz I heard you're saying it but I want someone to say it clearly yet.  Cracked. So when are they going to pendants this happens? If K is not equal to 3 because they're all columns.  are pivotal  that means we can immediately answer these three vectors linearly dependent that happens if k equals 3.  Which is just the opposite of parte, right if they're not linearly independent and they're linearly dependent and if you want you could write because the third column.  Is not pivotal.  Okay, great and now Parts he asks us for which values?  Would it be valid to answer that the reason is that at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others? Yes. That's an even better explanation cuz it tells you exactly that they are linearly dependent but two things first of all, this question doesn't ask you this question does ask you to just by how you got your answer. So one thing if you're going to stay that say specifically because the third column is a linear combination of the first two because otherwise what you're doing is your reiterating the definition of linear dependence and the greater might not know if you've actually checked in this example. Okay. So right as much as you can to demonstrate that you understand why you're saying it is is it the general rule here? That's exactly the point here. And so when are when is this is spanning set by have a collection of vectors, how can I tell in R3?  How can I tell when they span R3?  Mumble Mumble Mumble hand, please. Yes.  No answered when is linearly independent and that's not true. Although it is true if the Matrix to square as will prove on Friday, but it's not a good explanation because it's not true and general. How can we check if a set of vectors is linear is is a spanning set. Yes.  If every row is pivotal, so and this is so and we know when that happens looking up at our chart. That's when Casey is it when K is not equal to 3 K is not equal to 3 Because all rows are pivotal in this case.  precious  not for a square Matrix and we'll get into this on Friday, but we did examples last week where we had a collection of vectors that span R3, but we're not linearly independent examples of vectors that were linearly independent, but did not span R3. Yes that can actually happen and we'll talk about that tomorrow on Friday.  Okay. So suppose you have a 5 by 3 Matrix your * 3 by 5 Matrix. So it's their vectors in R3, but there are five of them you want to answer if they span R3 so you said suppose you found out that the first three columns were pivotal.  Well, if there's only three rows and that means all the roads are pivotal.  So you wanted a you wanted a 5 by 3 Matrix of 5 rows and 3 columns and you're answering do those columns span R3 the answer is that question doesn't make sense.  Because that's all I want to but because that the columns are in our five. They're not in our three. Okay, but if you had it the other way if you had five columns in R 3 and you're asked to do they span R3 the question is answered by figuring out if there is a pivot in every row and an example you said if the first three columns were pivotal then that means there's three pivots. That means that all three rows must be the only one pivot Pro.  Okay.  Any more questions about this example? Yes.  You have a 2 by 3 Matrix.  Again, if you have a 2 by 3 Matrix and you're asked if the columns span R3 the answer is that question doesn't make sense because the columns are not in our three there in our two.  This is a really important point that we need to get down and it's a super confusing point that everybody always has trouble with it first in this class for good reasons because your intuition is trying to tell you well, but maybe they're trying to tell you that you're looking for a three-dimensional Subspace in the language will learn next week. So this will all become much clearer next week, but you have to keep in mind for now that we were talking about standing sets. The span of a collection of vectors is the set of linear combinations of those vectors if those vectors have height 3 than the span of vectors is a set of three dimensional vectors if the hike to the span of vectors is a set of two dimensional vectors. It's a subset of our to it cannot span R3. It's not even in our three  All right. Now let's move on to problem for so so far the problems have all been exactly of the form that you've done on the homework. Okay, if you can do all the problems on the homework, if you can approach any of the homework sets you did and answer the problems that you'll be able to answer these now problems.  The fourth problem is different. The fourth problem is more like those end of the section textbook exercise has the more theoretical ones that make you think a little harder. So there's going to be one hard problem on the test. That's going to make you think a little harder. You're not all going to get that one Don't Panic it's there to put your feet to the fire. It's there to make you think it's there to try to get you to be creative. It's hard to be creative in a time setting not that many people are going to get full points on this problem. That's okay you're going to do well on the exam even if you don't get full points on that problem, but you should try you should work at 8. You should try to think about it to see how well the concept have meshed together and your brain is so here is the problem.  Is a linear transformation from R3 to R3?  And it has the following property. What you're told is that there are three vectors 1 - 1001 - 1 + 1 0 1 and tea has the properties at images of those three vectors under teeth sum up to zero.  The question is is t121 or not. Justify your answer is this problem has given you lots of consternation on Piazza. So let's talk about how we will answer it. Well.  First thing I would do is write down what it means 42. B121 T is one to one.  means  that's the equation x equals B.  Has zero or one solution?  for any given B  Can Arthur be okay if I want a salty of x equals B if I want to see if she is hit by T. Maybe it's not hit by team ABB is not in the range. So there's no solution. But if it isn't exactly one point exit maps to it. That's what it means for 2 to be one to one.  Now we have a bunch of serums that tell us how we could check if a matrix transformation is one to one. So if I knew the standard Matrix of T, I could use this theorem so that their own which says that she is one to one. If and only if The Columns of its standard Matrix are linearly independent equivalently. We're looking for every column to be pivotal just like in different contexts in the previous question, okay?  Do I know the standard Matrix of t?  Do I have enough information to figure out what the standard Matrix Matrix is? He is here.  No.  The standard Matrix 50 would require us to have lots of information. It says 3 by 3 Matrix. I do not have enough information. I'm only given one vector equation here one Venture equation is not enough information to find out three nine numbers. Okay, even if it had that vector equation had a unique solution, it would only be enough to find three numbers unique solution to a system of 3 by 3. But when you hear we would need to find an EIN numbers, there's just not enough information. We actually haven't pinned down what tea is here.  So that's a clue for you to say if I don't know what tea is. Am I going to be able to show that it is one-to-one, which is a Universal Property, which says no matter what be I plug-in I guess this property going to be pretty hard to check that so that's a clue for you to say. This probably means that he's asking me to show that t is not one to one because being not one to one isn't your property. So thus to show TV is not one to one.  I just need to find.  zombie  such that.  T-Rex equals B  has more than one solution.  If I can do that, then that means it's not one to one. I just need to find a single beef which that happens. It's easier to do it for single B and hint.  You can if you can do this at all, you can always do it with the zero Vector. So try the equal zero we wants to find a non-trivial solution for the homogeneous system.  Let's see if we can do that. Is there enough information there to tell us that we can do that while we haven't done anything yet. So I'm looking vectors.  Is the zero Vector so that all of the actors on the right hand side RB is on the right hand side there but it doesn't look like T of x equals B. It looks like the sum of teether things are B. But now we remember what is a linear transformation linear transformation is a function which respect Edition so  Here we have that the zero vector.  Is equal to T of I'll just rewrite what's written there.  hopefully without mistakes  30 equal to  don't want to have anything confusing here T of that factor plus T of that factor plus T of  not Vector, but the fact that t is linear.  Means that this is the same thing as T of the sub of those vectors.  That's the key Point here. The sum of T of some vectors is T of the some of those factors. That's true for linear Transformations. And now I'll just add up those vectors.  I get 1 + 0 + 1 is 2 - 1 + 1 + 0 0 + 0 + - 1 + 1 is 0 so20 but  this is not the zero vector.  So T of x equals zero has solution.  X equals 200 is that the only solution?  Know why not?  because it also has  the solution is 000 because she is a linear transformation always has enough information here to work out has another one as well there for tea is not one to one.  Okay.  That is one way to approach this, Honestly, I think it's the only way to approach this problem.  All right, so that is full solution to that version of that practice midterm.  There are five minutes left here. I'm happy to open the floor to your questions.  If there's a free variable in that.  Great question if I have a matrix, is it possible for The Columns of that Matrix to that are let's say it's an M by n Matrix. Is it possible that the columns of that Matrix span RM even if there's a free variable in that Matrix the answer is yes, absolutely in general. So let's look so for example  Let's do a 2 by 3 Matrix.  Let me hear even be easier here.  So there is a 2 by 3 Matrix. So it's columns are in our 2.  Do its columns span R2 they will first it does have a free variable. Let's carry this to row Echelon form. That's just going to require a rose swap.  So now this Matrix in reduced row Echelon form so we can see that this column is not pivotal and we knew that there was going to be an auntie little column here the country anymore pivots than there are rose, but there's more columns and rows. So at least one call him was going to be non pivotal. So if we have a system with this is its government Matrix, that system is going to have three variables.  Call does matrix span R2.  Yes, why?  Yes, because each row is pivotal.  All rows are pivotal.  there for the columns  spam R2  No, the caveat is if the Matrix had been a square Matrix that couldn't have happened because of the missions were Square Matrix and there were three variable that means one of the columns wouldn't be pivotal so would be one pivot down but in a square Matrix the number of columns equals the number of rows so we could also be one cuz it down in the in the Rose and it couldn't be that all rows are pivotal is a critical observation will come back to you on Friday. So if you have a square Matrix, it turns out that it's column span or two are and wherever they are if and only if they're linearly independent, that's an amazing property, but it's only true per square metre. Can you have time for one more question?  Okay for the last question, why would we try be equal 0 the answer is you should always try Vehicles run questions like this for two reasons why it's going to be easiest to work with and to it's a theory that we'll get to later that if in a linear system, you can find multiple solutions for ax equals be the solution of this already if there was more than one solution for ax equals be for some be then there will be multiple solutions for x equals 0 right thing back to the serum. I have an in homogeneous system ax equals B.  The solution set for that looks like the homogeneous solutions that translated by some particular Vector if I know that that translated set has infinitely many solutions. Then the homogeneous system have infinitely many solutions. So if it's going to be not one to one you can always check that with the zero Factor. Have a good day. Have a great afternoon. I'm looking forward to seeing you at 8. "
