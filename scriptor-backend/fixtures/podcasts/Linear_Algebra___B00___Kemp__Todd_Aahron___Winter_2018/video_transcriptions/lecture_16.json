    "Full Transcript": "Good morning. Happy Wednesday when I get straight to it today, so please find a seat.  Quick administrative reminders you are next MyMathLab homework that is due this coming Tuesday. There's no class on Monday. Okay, but the homework is due on Tuesday. It will cover everything that we do up to and including this lecture about determinants that will be on the following homework set forth lab assignment is due on February 23rd. Just coming up next Friday and just getting midterm coming up tonight is midterm 2 and there will be more detailed announcements about seating assignments rooms Etc in the coming Usher's.  So let's get started on the material for today.  So the last lecture we introduced a new word. It's not a new word, but we gave meaning to a word we've been using informally Dimension. So we saw that if I have any two.  Vector spaces revive a vector space if I have any two bases of it. So for us in this room almost always the vector spaces and subspaces were considering are ones that are spanned by a certain finite set of vectors. They said that's the contacts that were in here right now and so for such a vector space  For Subspace of another Vector space a basis, which is a linearly independent spanning set. But there's one common feature they all have which is the day all have the same number of members same number of element if there's one basis that has four vectors in it than all bases have exactly four vectors. So this number the number of vectors in any basis is called the dimension of the Subspace and so here's an example. We saw from a few years ago. So here's a vector space. This is the Subspace by the way of our three.  these are this is a collection of vectors in R3 and it is a Subspace we saw this is Subspace by just noting that we can do the sort of usual trick of decomposing this arbitrary Vector in there in the form a Time some Vector the vector 1 1 2  v e x a vector 1 - 1 0 so everything in their looks like that. So in fact he is equal to the  Okay. So now how would we find a basis for the Subspace? We need to find a spanning set. That is also linearly independent. We have a spanning set here. If it's linear Independence, we're done. It's a basis and this is an example where we don't need to do any work. There are two vectors and we can just look and see that neither is a scalar multiple of the other. They're not parallel there for their linearly independent and Saudis form a basis.  for the and therefore  the dimension of the  is equal to 2 cuz there is a basis with two vectors.  And therefore every basis for this Subspace will have two vectors in it.  Now, let's look at some other base used.  for the same Subspace  Cuz here's one let me just pick those two vectors and scale them like two to four.  + 1 - 110  see that's another basis for this space. Now. It's actually easy to check that that's the case those two vectors form a spanning set for the space because we'll all I did was to take the two vectors in Spanish that I already have and scale them a little bit. So any Vector that could be expressed as a linear combination of vectors up there.  It's clearly linearly independent same as before it we can just eyeball and see that it's not really independent, but actually better than that if you ever have a linearly independent set of vectors and all you do is you scale them by non-zero scalars. You're not going to change the linear Independence because that's not going to change whether it's all of those columns in The Matrix that you put together from them are pivotal, but here's another example  maybe worth discussing  Let's do let's include 112, but let's also do 2:02  How did I get that one? There is two vectors here V1 and V2?  So this one over here in the in the first second example, I used to be one in - be to those are also a basis. How about I hear I used to be one again. And then the second Vector here. That's B1 + B2.  No.  You shouldn't be able to stay unless you read him a text back right away or lots of bases. But you will you can say from here as you know, the span of those these two vectors here. That's still contained in Subspace V. If I have anything that is a linear combination of those two vectors following the same argument. We gave at the beginning of last lecture. It will be a linear combination of just B1 and B2 as well. Okay. So the span of these vectors is contained in the  Of the vectors up there. So the Subspace spanned by these two vectors.  But also you can just check that these two vectors here are linearly independent same deal. They are not scanning multiples of each other. So what I've got is a basis of size 2  Subspace of V but we know that every basis of V has two vectors in it. They so actually there can't be anything left over if there were anything in here that would be a new Vector which is not in the span of these guys and so by problem for a on your midterm the set consisting of these would be linearly independent.  Which means that you would have a a linearly independent, but that's impossible because it's an important point. It's not just true that every basis has the same number of vectors in it for a Subspace. It's also true that that number actually allows you to figure out whether something is a basis very easily. If I ever give you two vectors are linearly independent and form a basis because of the basis number of elements is constant.  So a basis you could rephrase as suppose. I know that the space is and dimensional. Okay, and is to hear if you know you have an n-dimensional space and you want to find a basis for its good enough to find any set of n linearly independent vectors and they will automatically also Spanish hat.  Vectors that span the space and then they will automatically be linearly independent you think about it those two statements. I just made get translated into the same fax machine over and over again, which is that if you have a square Matrix, if all the roads are pivotal than all the columns are pivotal and vice versa. And so that's a restatement of those facts and we could actually prove it that way at the end of this lecture after we talked about coordinates, but but that's an important when I wanted to make if you want to find a new basis for the space. Once you know, how many basis vectors you're looking for. You don't need to verify that it's both linearly independent and expanding said either one of those together with the number of vectors being right will be enough information to verify that it's a basis.  So that's dimension.  Right. I stated that V is it was an early election for this example, but if you're talking about here is a vector space V. Okay now tell me something about it find a basis for it to compute the dimension. You are not always expected to verify from first principles that what I told you was true if I go ahead and believe me there, please.  sex  Okay. So Dimension super important quantity, it makes precise something that we've all been thinking about and if I could get into that more later in this lecture, but you know many of you had this reaction when were saying I've got the question so many of you asked every time I do to stop people ask that question, it's a natural question aren't even in our too but what they do span is a two dimensional Subspace of R3 which lights are too and we will be more precise about what looks like memes at the end of this lecture.  But first let me introduce more terminology because we know we need more vocabulary in this course, right? We've only introduced to one new word today. We need at least a few more to keep up. So if I give you a matrix, there are two numbers Associated to it that come from the two subspaces. We've been talking about Associated to it. So if I give you a matrix, there's two important subspaces. We've been dealing with the column space and the null space the column space is the span of the columns.  Hey, that's a Subspace of the codomain for a the no space is the solution. That's a Subspace of the domain.  Well, those are two subspaces of of euclidean spaces of RN and RM are subspaces. They have Dimension each of them. You can find a basis and last day we talked about some ways to find basis for the space space names the dimension of the column space of a matrix a is called the rank of the Matrix today.  And the dimension of the null-space of a matrix a is called the nullity of a I'm not even sure your textbook uses that word. I think it's somewhere in the textbook but they usually just a dimension of the null space but this is a very common word. You'll see all over the place if you're doing anything else with linear algebra, so you should know it Noah T is the dimension of the null space.  Okay, so we can compute those for any Matrix because we know actually how to completely determined.  No space in the column space and in particular, we know how to find basis for them 5 by 4 Matrix. I've gone ahead and ask Matlab to do the row reduction for us. So we don't have to do any of the is I want to find a basis for the column space and I want to find a basis for the null space. Once we have the bases we can count up how many vectors are in each answer the question. What's the rank of a and what's the melody of a I'm so let's do that. So first of all,  The column space. Well, let's just the span of these four columns.  But is that the right number of columns? What is is this a four-dimensional space or if I were going to find a basis? How many vectors would it have? Somebody tell me what is a basis for the compass of a  The pivotal columns which are the pivotal columns in this example. Yes at the back.  Columns 1 and 2 columns 1 and 2 are pivotal are the only two columns.  And for yes, column 1 2 and 4 in a form of a those are pivotal column column three is a scalar multiple of column to which you can actually see the original Matrix. So it's not so those three form a basis vectors that are highlighted in yellow there a basis for the comp.  Wrong, you are all full know not of the reduced row Echelon form critical important point to remember those three columns are pivotal in the reduced row Echelon form of a and therefore those three columns called 1 2 and 4 are pivotal in a the column space of a the three columns that I highlighted in yellow. Those are not even in the column space of a there in the column space of the rooster Echelon form of a which is typically a different animal rights a very important point so that here is a basis.  these three form of Asus  for the column space of a  I know that means that I can tell you what the dimension of the column space is. It is 3 so therefore the rank of this Matrix is 3  No, I also want to find a basis for the null space of a and as we saw last day that way to do that for a way to do that to follow the procedure. We've been doing since day one row reduction in order to describe the solution set. So the null-space of a  Is the set of vectors? Okay. It's going to be vectors in R4.  Because the Matrix has four columns.  And we look at the reduced row Echelon form to see what the equation say about those. So the first equation 1000 coefficient system next one must be zero.  The second equation says x 2 - 2 x 3 x 3 is a free variable is actually the third equation that tells us that x40.  I'm so that is a full description of the null space and we can do our usual trick factoring out the free variable x 3 we see that everything in the nose best looks like some free variable X the vector 02210  in other words the null space is the span.  of the single vector 0210  now we saw last day why it's always true that using this procedure. We will produce not just a spanning set but of an actual basis and that's because if you look at the entries corresponding to the free variables here, you'll get the standard basis vectors in the different vectors against painting set here.  This non pivotal column here gives us this one here. Okay, which is the standard basis Vector of our one and number one.  But anyway, when there's only one vector you don't need to do any work to see if it's linearly independent or not. Remember that any nonzero Vector form is a linearly independent set. So we have one nonzero Vector here. It's a basis for our space there for the dimension of the space is  What there's a basis of size one? So therefore the dimension of the null space of a is one which is defined to be the nullity.  So there's are two numbers for this Matrix Rank and nullity.  now we can see from this by the way how we can figure out what those numbers are without going through this much work because  the column space is pointed out is spanned by the pivotal columns and they form a basis because the pivotal columns are linearly independent.  That means that the rank the dimension of the column space, which is the number of elements in any basis is the number of pivotal columns.  So that's another way we can just describe. What is the rank of a matrix in the right column in that makes  The Matrix well we see from this procedure that will work in the Spanish. That we know is a basis for the null space each non pivotal column variable is going to give us  By the way, can you guys do the difference between the yellow and the green up there? I really can't I'm color-blind, but I made a mistake for myself doing that. But hopefully it's not a problem for you guys. Try to avoid each non pivotal column is going to give us one of the columns that spans than l-space. It's not right to say that the pivotal in the non-payment of columns are a basis for the null space then not even in the null space, but to each non pivotal column in a corresponds a basis vector.  So that means the nullity of a is the number of non pivotal call UPS in The Matrix. So actually once you have the reduced row Echelon form of the Matrix or any any row Echelon form of the Matrix, you can quickly answer the question. What's the ranking? What's the nullity? These are just new words for number of pivotal columns versus number of non pivotal columns.  And that's what I just wrote right here. So that's that's right it again. So the rank of a is equal to the number of pivotal columns.  And The Melody of a is equal to the number of non-committal columns.  So that gives right there and actually super important them is called the rank nullity theorem or sometimes just the rank theorem and it's the statements that for any Matrix.  Fixed for all matrices of a given size. So what is it the rank plus the melody is equal to  Send number of columns. That's it.  Okay.  So here's another way to think about this for the number of columns of a matrix taking back to lecture 1 The Columns of the Matrix correspond to the variables in our system of equations. So the number of columns is the number of variables.  What is the rank the rank is the number of pivotal columns which is also the same as the number of pivotal Rose, of course that the rose correspond to equations.  A pivotal role is one that is not a linear a scalar multiple of the other. There's not a linear combination of the others a pivotal role as an equation. That is not redundant.  So we start with some system of equations, but it might be as we've seen that you can reduce it to a system of fewer equations.  Those equations correspond to the pivotal Rose.  The rank is that number of non-redundant equations. It's the actual amount of information that's there.  Cuz that's what the rank is hits the number of equations that really describes the constraints of the system. And the melody is the leftover information is the number of redundant equations and the statement. You have a bunch of equations in some unknown there might be fewer than the number of equations that really have the information there.  The sum of the number of redundant equations and the number of non-redundant information. That's just the number of variables. I give you some variables that might be free or they might all be constrained but whatever happens the number of three variables plus the number of constraints is just the number of variables.  Okay, so that's the rank nullity theorem is the number of columns.  Now here's one more Subspace Associated to a matrix your textbooks talks about and that isn't going to be important in some applications later the row space of the Matrix. So the column space remember the column space with the span of a columns.  Now the columns are column vectors an RN or RN whatever letter were using as we've been talking about from the beginning. But remember we're also open to Vector spaces that have different forms to them. We've been talked about how make sure this themselves can be considered as vectors. So how about the rows of the Matrix? Those are also factors were accustomed to taking of vectors as columns, but for our purposes right now, we can talk about actually the rose or vectors as well can take linear combinations of the Rose. In fact, that's what we've been doing since day one taking linear combinations of the Rose is what we do when we do row operations,  The row space of a matrix is the span of the Rose.  And we can write it in a slightly different way because remember there's this nice operations on matrices that turn them on their side or that rotate them around or reflect them across the main diet of the diagonal of the transpose. The transpose turns the rows into columns in the columns and rows from Matrix. So another way to write what the row space is is to say, well the roads face is the span of the Rose the rose of a are The Columns of a transpose.  So the row space can equivalently be thought of as the column space of a transpose right into the framework that we've already been studying. This is what your textbook writes it slightly because the column space of a transpose is still a collection of columns.  Right. So we're taking the cult the Roosevelt way. We're turning them on their side to make them columns and then taking their span that gives us a space of columns. Where is the row space is a space of Rose. So if you want to be really technically correct, you should also take the transpose back to make those columns back into Rose. Okay, that's a bit of a notational point. It's not that important as long as we're consistent about this thing. You're going to think of the roast basis to set up as a span of the rows of The Matrix.  So let's just look at an example.  Before we go any further. Here's a matrix a a 3 by 5 Matrix.  And I would like to determine what the row space is what I should have written it down already here for you because by definition the row space is the span of the rows of those 3 reps.  but  This is a Subspace Subspace. And as usual, we would like to have a basis for it would like to have a minimal description of it. So is ever found a basis are the rows of that Matrix of a basis for the row space of that Matrix linearly independent.  What do you think just looking at the Matrix? Are they?  No, somebody said no confidently. Why not?  You're right, but why not?  Yes.  The second row is three times the first row. So there's there's a sort of in your face linear dependence there. Okay, so they are not linear the independent throw away the second row but there's no point of including it. So let's just go ahead and and do that. Let's just throw it away and we won't change the row space when we do that. We can see how the row space is the span of the first column in the third column.  At 3rd for first row in third row of a and are those two linearly independent. So there is a basis for the row space.  Alex systematized.  We did with the column space. So I'm going to do row operations in order to take this Matrix to reduced row Echelon form or actually, I'll just go to row Echelon form.  Okay, I'm going to subtract 3 times the first row from the second.  And as was pointed out that actually just gives a whole row of zeros here.  Okay. So the next thing I should do is  Eliminate the one well, actually there's a couple of different choices. I could make here. Let me do this instead. We know in the row reduction algorithm. If you ever get a Rosie Rose, you supposed to shuffle it to the bottom right doing rows swaps. So let's do that roast. Well, cuz all the Roses there. Is there supposed to be at the bottom.  Okay. I know I'm not quite in relaxalon form yet. I got to get rid of the one in the second row in the First Column. So I subtract the first row from the second using the zero I want there.  1 they're 3 1 and 4.  I know this Matrix is in row Echelon form so we can tell which rows are pivotal so which roads are pivotal.  in this Matrix in there in the one that I've just arrived at  the first and the second Rosa are pivotal here.  okay, so I guess that means that we should take the first and second rows of a  know why not?  I'm sorry. I just heard mumbling.  We switch some rolls around. This is the point that I wanted to make with this example. So remember in the column space I said you look you do alterations you get to Russia one for me figure out which columns in the rush rush on Farmer pivotal those columns that are pivotal in the original Matrix use the ones in the original Matrix as your basis vectors.  Because the first two column the first two rows of of this row Echelon form that we just arrived at those are pivotal but those correspond to the first and third rows in the original Matrix follow through the row reduction the row operations and see if I were to just give you an exam. Here's a matrix a here's its reduced row Echelon form find the pivotal Rose. You can't do it. You can't figure out which were the pivotal Rose in a just by looking at the final for the reduced row Echelon form.  Okay, so that's a problem except it's not a problem because we could just as well say hey.  When I did row operations, they looked up the columns. They didn't change the linear relationships between columns, but they change the column space which is why when I'm trying to find the column space, I have to look at the pivotal columns in the original Matrix.  But row operations don't mark up the row space.  What is the row space is the space of linear combinations of the row row operations are linear combinations of the Rope?  Row operations don't change the row space to change the column space but not the row space so I could just as well.  You is as a basis the pivotal columns that I just arrived at.  Okay, I could just as well use the pivotal columns in a row Echelon form. I could continue I could go one more Salon form here and I could use those columns as well. There's more freedom here. You're not changing the row space. So as long as you know, which column which rows are pivotal at any given time you can use those Rose in any row equivalent form of the Matrix and they will form a basis for hero space. That's only true for the row space not for the column space. So that's a subtle to hear. If you're asked for a basis of the row space. I recommend you always use the pivotal role in the reduced row Echelon form if that's given to you. If you're asked for a basis of the column space, you must always use the pivotal columns in the original Matrix that you don't have a choice about it from that information.  Crystal, that's what they're only wanted to highlight here, which is row operations. Don't mess up the row space. The Rogue space of a is the same as the row space of the reduced row Echelon form of a and then one more thing I wanted to highlight here, which is okay. So I've got this new space the row space.  That's a third one from HSV of the conquest of the nails place. Now, we've got the row space now on the last slide. I introduced introduced the new notation some new terminology Rank and nullity rank was the dimension of the column space. Melody is the dimension of the null space. Maybe we should have had more words. Maybe I should have said the column rank is the dimension of space and I should have Ro rank is the dimension of the row space. I need to have a word for the dimension of the row space.  Well, I don't need an extra word for it because remember what is the ranks rank is the dimension of the column space. That's just the number of faces elements in any basis for the column space and the nicest basis that we you know how to find for the column space is the pivotal columns other words. The rank is the number of pivotal columns in The Matrix a that relate to the Roosevelt.  Well, let's think about it for a moment. So then the dimension of the row space of a is the number of pivotal.  Columns of a  and the way we calculate that is we go to the reduced row Echelon form and we just count the number of pivotal ones.  and the reduced row Echelon form of a  There's a pivotal one in each pivotal column. But remember is a pivotal one in each pivotal row and column.  The number of capital one's is also equal to the number of pivotal Rose.  Did Eddie or the reduced row Echelon form of a?  Okay, and oh, I'm sorry. So I should have started here.  So dimension of the column space I started with here and this this is equal to the dimension of the row space down here. So let me reiterate that.  Let's go backwards. The dimension of the row space of a is a size of a basis for the row space of a which is the number of total rows in a but the number of pivotal Rose and the number of pivotal columns in a matrix the same number they just count the number of pivotal once in the reduced row Echelon form. So the dimension of the row space and the dimension of the column space are the same animal. This is the rank of the rank of accounts. Not only the number of pivotal columns, but also counts the number of pivotal Rose.  One word of caution the rank nullity theorem says that the rank plus the melody equals the number of columns.  It doesn't equal the number of rows in typically in less than or frozen accounts are equal. So you should remember the rank as describing the number of pivotal column. But remember that it also is the number of rows. So it's also the dimension of the row space.  All right. That's what I wanted to say about Dimension and rank now for the remainder of this lecture or talk about section 4.4.  I'd really the subject of section 4.4. Is this anyway, what's so great about a basis. I've described it as being a description efficient description of a Subspace, but it's more than that and let's think back way way back to elementary school middle school, but whenever you encountered it.  so Cartesian coordinates named after a house, which means Renee the mapmaker K given address to every point on Earth for him, but in general to every point in the plane or in Space the plane for now every Point metric lie, we imagined points not as just points, but as arrows emanating from the origin, that's why I've drawn here, but this Vector hear this as the vector 2 3  Should have me move that appear. Oops.  Can I see the vector 2 3 and why do we call it the vector to 3 because if I drop a line down here, it's two units in the X Direction.  And if I drop line over here is 3 units in the y direction, but what's really going on there?  Is that here? I have the standard basis Vector E1 and here I have the standard basis, Vector E2.  There's anyone there Z2 and what describing that Vector is 2/3 really means.  Is it that is two times the first standard basis Vector plus three times the second standard basis vector.  Okay, it's chewy OnePlus 3 e 2.  Now if you want Annie to is a basis to standard basis.  fart  And that's what it does for you.  Every point in your Subspace in your vector space. Can I give you a basis? The basis is a spanning set. So every Vector in the space is a linear combination of the basis vectors.  That's true for any spanning set. What's special about a basis? What's special about the fact that it is a linearly independent spending said is that those components those coordinates will be unique have a question.  So that's a statement here. If I give you a basis behind it supposed to be for a vector space than every Vector in the space has a unique expansion in terms of the basic factors. That is it's a spanning set. So every Vector Envy can be written as a linear combination of the bees but not only accommodation is only one set of coefficients X-14 XM that makes this work why is it unique? So that's the important word here unique.  Why well, if we also had a different one in ostensibly different one.  So having the X ends are coefficients that make this work for a particular V supposed to let me do raw fresh in here. Let me subtract equation one from equation to that says that V - V is equal to what let me collect terms now everything that multiplies be one is X1 - X2 X1 - y1.  Has to be one everything that multiplies B2 is X2 - Y2.  Factors that are scalars * be too and so on Down the Line.  Novi - 3 equals 0 so look at this for a moment here. I've got a new linear combination of the vectors V1 through BM.  What's coefficients here?  I've got a linear combination of these basis vectors that gives the zero Factor.  The basis vectors are linearly independent that exactly means that the only way you can get a linear combination of them equaling zero is if all the coefficients are zero so because these are linearly independent, all those coefficients are zero.  But that means that x 1 equals y 1 + x 2 equals y 2 + x 10 equals y the only way you can find V as a linear combination of these is that one unique way every Vector has a unique set of coordinates. That's what these are called coordinates.  Determined by the bassist. That's what's so important about a basis. They give us a way to coordinate eyes are some space to put coordinates on it.  So let's let's formalize that event lets out a little bit of notation, which is actually to be super helpful and understanding this tricky Point we've had since we started talking about solving equations in Spanish sets.  So if V is a vector space has a basis vectors, we could be talking about the Subspace the column space of some Matrix and the bees are the pivotal columns are not typically the standard basis vectors.  There's some vectors in this Vector space that form a basis for the Spectra space.  Then we can so that Vector space has a basis of size n think of an equal three here.  If you have a basis of size 3 the dimension of your vector spaces 3  this process of putting coordinates from the basis on your space does is it allows you to identify this abstract Vector space with our three?  Space with RN unique way to express it as a linear combination of the given basis vectors. So this one has coordinates x 1 x 2 3 x n  I'm going to go look at the associated Vector in r n which has those coordinates as its coefficients is the coordinate Vector of v in terms of the basis B, and it's just telling you those coefficients. There are the ones that describe the in terms of that basis and you take those coefficients and just bring them together in a column Vector that's called the coordinate Vector of the in terms of the basis B.  so for example if I have a vector in R to which I write as a column, Vector AV  Then it's coordinate Vector in terms of the standard basis is a beat. That's exactly what it means as we noted on the previous slide up here. Okay that if I take the vector 2  I saw the coefficient of that sector in terms of the standard basis E1 and E2.  are two and three  Careful here. It's really important that says basis vectors are ordered. Cuz the order you choose for the basis vectors. Although that doesn't change the dimension or the column space or anyting else in our examples. We've seen it does determine the coefficients of the coordinate Vector. So if we have a vector in R to we can always write it in terms of the standard basis, but this here's another basis of R2.  The ventures 1 1 + 1 - 1 we know it's a basis of our two because four bases of RNA. We have a serum that are too if they form a basis. All I have to do is write down the court. They Matrix with those vectors as its columns and check if that is an invertible Matrix and so is this Matrix here 1-1 1-1 invertible.  Another words are those two columns linearly independent.  I could also let's remind ourselves about inverses. Let's calculate the inverse of that. Matrix is a sidebar over here.  We have our nice formula for two by two matrices. So what I have to do is divided by this number the determinant which is 1 X - 1 - 1 x 1 so that gives me a -2 down there and then I have to reverse.  The dog on trees and put minus signs in front of the off diagonal entries.  So what I get is actually just 1/2 x 2 Matrix 1 1 1 - 1  that's the inverse there is invertible and I want to ride it. I want to write it in terms of that basis. So I want to say here's my Vector a b.  But I want to know what are its coordinates in terms of the basis B.  In other words, I have to say I take the vector a be written in the standard basis and I have to be able to write it as x 1 x 1 1  + x 2 * 1 - 1 span R2 they form a basis. So I will be able to write a v as a unique combination of those two vectors. Once I can do that. Then this thing here this coordinate Vector of a D in terms of that new basis. That's what we call X1, X2.  Now let's push this a little further now. I'm going to find that X1 and X2. Of course. What I'm doing here is I'm going to solve equation A and B. I'm thinking of it as known parameters and I want to find the X1 and X2 that makes it work. So how do I do that?  No, we're just talking about row reduction would be the usual way to do it because I already computed the inverse Matrix. I'm going to use it here because know that this says 1 1 1 - 1 * x 1 x 2 is equal to a b and the inverse Matrix is set up perfectly there for X1 X2 is equal to the inverse of that Matrix.  x a b which is 1/2 1 1 1 - 1 a b which is  A + B / 2A - B / 2  And there are the coordinates. Okay, so that's what the the coordinates of B in this new.  Basis we start with a vector a b and the new coordinates of that Vector in this new bases are a + b / 2 + a - b / 2 for the way it's very instructive in this example to look on a picture so I can have a lot of room here. Let's squeeze it in peso here in straight lines.  So my standard basis vectors.  Are here and here?  And these new basis vectors in the basis be on photos in red they are here and here.  The new bases I get by taking the old frame and rotating at 45 degrees. And also I've liked them the vector. These aren't vectors of unit length. Is that while we haven't talked about like that, but you can see that they're longer Arabs. So expressing a vector in terms of the new basis means they have to turn my head 45\u00b0 and scale a little bit and that's exactly what this operation here. Does the new coordinates to be over to it. So if I started with the vector 1 0 then it's coordinates. The first two bases are 1/2 0.  3 or 1/2 1/2  cancel that first standard basis Vector its new coordinates are 1/2 1/2.  And all that means is that if you want to express that Vector 1 0 as a linear combination of the vectors 1 1 + 1 - 1 you have to take a half times the first + 1/2 times the second.  So that's coordinates. So let's finish with one more example here in the last 3 minutes.  Just to stretch our minds a little bit.  Hey, let's look at the vector space of polynomials of degree 2.  Crystal that is to say Vector space of Hollywood's agreed to at most the vector space the space of polynomials the set of polynomials of degree 2 is not a vector space just like we did with the example of polynomials of degree 3 0 polynomials and then there were fine as oops.  as a  everything of the form a + BX + c x squared for a B and C are any coffee shops that we want.  Now do you think about it what that says and we discuss this at the end of last picture. Is that one x x squared? Those are polynomials there in the space and what we're up there says that they are spending set and as we discussed last day they are linearly independent. So that's a basis for the space that here's a polynomial polynomial is x - 1 squared.  It's in the Spectra space P2. That means it has coordinates in terms of this bases feet.  We can express it as a linear combination in a Uconnect unique way of those pulling out those three basis vectors. So let's figure out how well will remember how to multiply polynomials this is x squared minus 2x + 1 and we see that it's representative linear combination of x squared x looking at these coefficients hear what we see is that the coordinates of B in terms of the basis the circled standard basis One X x squared of the polynomial is okay. Well the first Vector here is a one and so the coefficient there is a one the second one X. It's coefficient is -2 and the third one. It's coefficient is 1  So if you're just thinking of the vector X - 1 squared if you have trouble thinking of that too and instead of thinking of PS2 polynomial something I know how to manipulate and multiply and find roots of I'll think of it as an abstract vector and then write its coordinates in terms of this basis. It's really just the column Vector 1-2 one, which I know how to handle and know how to deal with a next time. We'll start in the first 10 minutes of a Friday's lecture talking about what the score. "
