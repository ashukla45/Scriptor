Some people have been posting on Piazza, which is great. Please continue to do that confusion about how to start approaching some of the problems in the second half of the appointment and part of the reason. I think you're confused about some of those problems as we just haven't gotten to that stuff in luxury at so many more of those problems will be easy to approach Okay, let me make one more administrative here. A number of people have emailed me about looking at the grading on their midterm and having some questions. There are specific instructions on how to approach a re-grade request that are posted on the course webpage and on Piazza and on Triton said they were posted last Friday afternoon. So please take a structions. If you believe that you deserve every great. You need to contact your ta and arrange to meet with them probably during either section or office hours this week before Friday afternoon and write out careful explanation of why does you think that you deserve more points on a particular problem and then you will discuss it with them and take it from there. That's the procedure for requesting a re-grade. All right. Today we are going to continue with Section 4.1 Vector spaces and subspaces and then proceeded to section 4.2 which will relate these new fancy words with things that you've already been doing all quarter case. It's going to make it much more concrete. So will understand both what these new things Vector spaces and subspaces are about and it will give new insight into the stuff that we've been doing in terms of solving linear equation since the beginning. And then next time on Friday, we will move onto linear Independence sets and basis of vector spaces.  Okay, so just to review technical notion Vector space is  Play together with a special element we call 00 equipped with two operations vector addition and scalar multiplication.  That combine elements of that set in in a ways together that follow the rules of addition and scalar multiplication. We are used to from grad school elementary mathematics. Okay as we've been working through here.  Can you take any set and make this work? Could you have a vector space that has only two elements in it? No, that's not possible. Because if you have a vector in the space some Vector, I mean I'm thinking of it as an arrow like my arm pointing out here. But if you have some nonzero Vector in the space, you have to be able to scale it by real numbers. That's part of that conditions here. It has to be closed under scalar multiplication if I can take that vector and scalar it then that one vector scales up by all real numbers to infinitely many different factors such as soon as you have at least one nonzero Vector in your space. It must be infinite inside. Okay. It must go on Marriott in all directions, but it must go on it and it infinitely far in the directions that you have.  Now one exceptional case here is if the vector space consists of just the zero Vector that's possible. That is a vector space. That is what one of my University professors would have called the stupidest example, you could just have the zero vector and that satisfies all the axioms stupidly of a vector space again space. So we did some examples of all polynomials that is a vector space zero polynomial in those things interact the way they're supposed to for vector addition and multiplication. Where is the set of polynomials of degree exactly equal to 3 was not a vector space because that's that was not closed under addition. For example, we saw an example of two.  Degree, 3 polynomial whose sum was not degree 3 it was degree too. So that's it was not closed under the vector operations for the set of polynomials of degree at most 3 0 1 2 and 3 that is another example today.  The set of 2 by 3 matrices P by Q means the set of matrices with P rows into columns.  No, we are we've been working with matrices since the first lecture in this class, but we've been thinking about them as the coefficients of a system of linear equations or more recently as an algebraic objects that we can multiply together and maybe they have inverses sometimes that sort of thing.  But now I want to think about them differently again. I'm going to take about these things that i x e the vectors in this space. So if it's going to be a actor, how do I add two vectors and how do I scale a X Factor by any real number and then verify that all of those operations satisfy all the rules that they're supposed to satisfy, but we already know how to add matrices together. I did that. So let's in the stew by 3 case.  The Matrix looks like a 1/8 there. Let's call it a 1 b 1 c 1  D1 E1 F1 and there's another one A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2. So there's two sort of arbitrary.  2 by 3 matrices, I don't need to tell you how to add them. And I also need to tell you how to scale a multiply one of them. Let's actually do those two at the same time. I'm going to tell you how to steal or multiply the first one. That'll tell me the rules for doing both.  Hey, but we know how that works. We have to scale.  All the entries of the first Matrix and add those to the corresponding entries of the second Matrix.  plant a D1 + D2  B1 + B2 and Lambda F1 + F2 so there is my rule. That's how we scalar multiply and add matrices. We knew this already and there is a zero Matrix and we highlighted the fact that it satisfies the property that the zero Matrix has to have that if you add the zero Matrix of the appropriate size to any Matrix actors have to satisfy. So it's now a laborious but routine for additional making the space of 2 by 3 matrices into a vector space 321 matrices is a vector space in the same way, but the set of all matrices is not a vector space.  Why?  In order for something to be a vector space you have to be able to add any two things together.  Okay, if I give you a 2 by 3 Matrix and a 7 by 8 Matrix, can I add them together? There's no natural way to add those two together. So that's space that set of all matrices is not a vector space but the set of  Zach of matrices of a fixed size is always a better place so we can think of the matrices as vectors in the right context.  Which is this line here? It's the set of all scalar multiples of the vector 1 2.  It said this is a line in the planets draw a picture of it.  So that means it's a line of slope to here.  Like that, it's that line what I mean is it's all vectors along that line. So let's draw the vectors in Black. So here is one vector in that line. And here's another Vector in that line. Here's another one and another one and so on all of those are points in this space. All those are vectors in this Vector space if I want to verify that it's a vector space. I need to tell you how to add things and how to scale multiply them. Well,  We know how to do that already because these are vectors these are vectors in R2, but it's not all of actors in are too that's okay. I already have an addition Rule and a scalar multiplication rule. So if I take two of them, let's say  Ask * 1 to that's one element of the fln another element t x 1/2 and I add them together. What I get is of course s + t x 1/2 and that is  Want to and that is again back on the same line. That's just saying that if I take his two parallel vectors in that direction as them up, I get a new Vector in that same direction.  And some only if I scale a vector up it's in that line. You can see from the picture that stays in the line, of course and the last most important there are lines in the plane that don't pass through 0 that kind of line cannot be a vector space because it doesn't matter in example of a  All right. So actually is that last example is a special kind of vector space? Well sort of it's it's really easier to deal with because it was but it was already in a bigger Vector space that we understand rights of the vector spaces. We've been working with since the very beginning are in.  Those we understand pretty well and that last example was a subset of RN but not any old stuff that it was a subset. That itself was a vector space under the same Vector operations that has a vector space with respect to and that kind of vector space is going to be play critical role for us for the rest of the quarter. So we call it a Subspace.  This is a word by the way that if your science-fiction fan years is words are probably sounding like things that you hear on in science fiction shows all the time, but they have specific mathematical meaning and the words were used in linear algebra long before they were imported into Star Trek him and another places. I like those shows too, but we're not going to be rocking. We're not going to be blowing your mind with any kind of today. I think so you start with a vector space to be like RN or maybe like the space of all polynomials extra space.  How do you look at a subset of that? Maybe not the whole thing that symbol with a is a subset of that symbol there. It's a w is a subset of the the line underneath means that it's a subset but it might actually be the whole thing. Right like this table is a subset of itself kind of silly thing to say, but it is is contained in or is equal to another way. You could pronounce that.  Inside a bigger Vector space we call it a Subspace if it is closed under the operation.  What does that mean exactly what let's let's clarify. So first things first. There is an important words turn on empty. The empty set is a trip is is a stupid example of a subset of every step that contains nothing, but that's not a vector space not a vector space.  This is a kind of a tricky question, but there is a definite answer based on the definition.  Any thoughts. Yes.  It doesn't still have a direction. Okay. Well every every Vector in the empty set has a direction which is that that statement is true, even though there's no actors in their rights. Like the current King of France is bald is a true statement because there is no king of France.  That's precisely so the issue is always in the vector space. What is it? The zero Vector the empty set doesn't contain a zero Vector therefore. It's not a vector space. So you have to start with the subs that it has to be closed under the vector operations. So that means  it has to be closed under addition and scalar multiplication must be the case that  if I take two vectors u and v that are in the Big vectorspace W, but are actually in the little vectorspace the little the little set W, which is a subset of V.  then the song  well space RN.  And so there's some is an RN cuz all right as a vector space, but they're also in this Subspace the line of slope 2 in the plane.  So the sum of the two vectors, I know that it's in our too. But in order for that line to be a Subspace, it must be that that sum of the two vectors is back in the Subspace.  Not just Envy.  But actually in this subset.  If Lambda is a real number.  And V is a vector maybe look book called. Ww.w as a vector in this subset. W.  Then all scalar multiples of that are back in W. Not just Envy we knew it was Envy already because V is closed under the operations, but it's critical that it's actually closed.  It's actually seeing that the subset w we don't need that third statement explicitly because then Alice * 0 is  There any Vector * 0 is there a soon as you have one vector? If you know, you're a Subspace you must have the zero Vector as well, but it's not doesn't hurt to just ate explicitly that in there. The zero sub space is always closed under the operations if I take any two zero one of them their sum is zero if I take it any Vector is 0 * any number I get zero under the vector operations. So you always have that Subspace around but usually you'll have more interesting ones if the vector space itself, isn't this  It's under the same Vector operations and the image we should have is all of the kind of things that we've been working with already geometrically where the space is the space R3 maybe and the Subspace is a line passing through the origin in R3 or a plane passing through my two arms. The origin is here in my torso. Okay, so that the plane passes through the origin. Those are the geometric ideas. You should have in mind when you think Subspace like a lion or a plane in R3 those are subspaces as long as they pass through the origin.  This is the kind of language. We're going to use to describe.  76 dimensional subspaces of 324 dimensional space that we can't visualize but can use the mathematics here to describe just as well question.  Is a little nectar what story?  The question is is the one that was a mistake to use WW2 in both of those things. So I'll try to save you.  But maybe we'll try to use different letters to make that clear in the future. All right, so that's a Subspace examples.  Here's a great example the first one there.  Sonr 3. This is just the kind that I was talking about. I'm going to go with my arms in our three here is a subset of specified for you.  Of the form x y 0 0 that's not all vectors in R3 geometrically. It's easy to describe. It is the xy-plane XYZ space that are only in the xy-plane that don't have any of these components. That is a Subspace.  Why is it a Subspace where we can verify that it's a Subspace? We just need to check closed under addition and under scalar multiplication. So let me just do this one here for example, so if I take any Vector x y 0 and I scare X some real number Lambda the definition is that that's equal to Lambda Lambda y 0 which is again an element of ww.w is defined to be those who is Campari 0  Start component of zero and if I scale a multiply one of those vectors by any number I get a vector very similar argument and the zero Vector is in there, right? Because zero X as X and Y both being zero is allowed in that definition.  Now this might look a lot like what we had to do to verify that.  General abstract things were Vector spaces in the last lecture, but the reason is because we weren't actually going through the whole verification of something you need an extra space before remember there were those 16 conditions on your textbook it safe for this thing to be a vector space you need to Define addition of the distributive and all the different ways of a Subspace because I already know that the operations and which are typically easy things to verify.  And then I will automatically know that all of those 16 conditions hold for the general operations on the hold extra space.  So the moral of the story is it's much easier to check something as a stop on its own.  I didn't write down here at most three is a vector space actually that second one and it's a vector space in its own right? If I add up two polynomials of degree at most 3 there do the song has degree at most three multiplication and the zero Vector the zero polynomial has degree.  Okay. How about this one here. So this is a dimensional Space X Y 1  is that a Subspace or not? I'm going to give you 50.  Alright, let's see what we think how many people think that is a Subspace.  1 1/2 people how many people think that is not a Subspace.  Lot of very confident people. That's great with somebody would just raise their hand the second time like to explain why they voted that way.  It doesn't contain the zero Vector. Perfect. That's one way to see it. The zero factor is not in there. So it's not a Subspace because it doesn't contain the zero Vector but there was three conditions. Maybe it's not as bad as the other one, but it's not so hard to see that that's impossible doctor. Then you also must fail both of the other tests as well. For example, if I took two vectors in here to arbitrate actors in here X1. Y1, 1 + X2 Y2 to that y21, right? Those are too arbitrary vectors in there and I add them up when I get is X1 + y 1  That's right X1 + X2. Y1. + Y2 + 1 + 1 which is too so this thing is not back in a the sum of any two of these things is not in that thing. It's these are the maximally failing that condition no matter which ones you choose the sum will never be back in there.  Famous killer X by anything other than one and stay in there. So that thing is not a Subspace. It is a translation of a Subspace you take everything in the Subspace w?  And add to them the vector 0-0-1. So you're everything in W by the vector zero zero one that should look familiar thinking back to your three or four of this class. When we talked about systems Solutions pets of homogeneous system Nations always contains the zero vector and 0 0 not whatever the bee is on the other side, but that the solution set will look like this it will look like  Solutions that which will see you in a few minutes is always a Subspace to buy some particular solution.  Okay, so things like that set a there they're relevant to what we've been working on in this class, but they're not subspaces. They're slightly more General.  Okay, here's another example. Here's a set of 2 by 3 matrices subset of the set of all of the components are not any for but particularly the 1 1 1 2 2 1 and 2/3 and trees are nonzero and the 1/3 and 3121 and 1/3 and 2 two entries are always zero in there. That's the that's set of matrices. Is this one question?  This symbol here.  That's the symbol that I highlighted to slides ago or one side ago. It's the contained in symbol is a subset of symbol.  Thanks for pointing that out. It's a symbol that may be unfamiliar to many of your textbook uses it and so we need to add it to our lexicon of symbols that we can read.  Okay, so this is a subset of the set of 2 by 3 matrices question. Is is it a Subspace or not do some calculations?  All right, seems like people are cutting down a bit. So let's do it again. How many people think that this is a Subspace?  Looks like most of you any people think it's not a Subspace.  Nobody, okay. Well democracy work. It is in fact a Subspace would someone like to explain why?  Yes.  Brakes, let me repeat what you said. That's that's a great explanation. There's nothing that you could add or multiply that would change the structure of this Matrix the structure of this Matrix that has zeros in three and two to Physicians that is preserved under the vector operations. The first thing that is the zero Matrix is in there. Let's give this that a name. Let's let's call this thing. I don't know Bob zero is in Bob check.  And now we need to see that addition and scalar multiplication preserve the structure. So let's be pedantic about it. But the way you said it already explains how this works. So I'm going to take to arbitrate elements of this guy.  If I add them up the way I asked to add like positions components.  0 + 0 is zero there.  And that is back in Bob. Okay. So on a similar argument with scale and multiplication will show the same thing. So yes, this thing is a Subspace Bob is a Subspace.  Great.  Okay one last example. Let's take the set is a subset of the real line. It is the unit circle.  Okay, so that is the set of points on the on the unit circle. So I mean by that vectors like like this one here.  Okay, and that one over there and that one over there? Okay doctors of unit likes. Those are the vectors in this subset. What do you think?  But someone like to raise hand and tell me what they think.  Perfect. No because it can't be scared of x if I take any Vector in this set and a scalar multiplied by any number that is not one.  The resulting Vector is no longer in the set. So it is not closed under scalar multiplication.  Not closed under addition. Okay, if I take too arbitrary vectors of length 1 their sum is typically not of length 1 interesting problem for you to think about geometry problem. Are there two vectors of Psalm has  That's if I fix say this first over there. Can you find any vectors on the circle? So if I add them to that I get a vector of length 1 the answer is yes. There are exactly two of them and I believe it to you to think about that if you're interested in fun puzzles like that, but typically they're almost always there song will not be back in there. So it's definitely not a Subspace.  We could do a similar example of where we which was what if we did the disc, let's do that.  So the disc contained in our two and that consists of  the filled in circle. Okay, so we're allowed to have vectors that are inside as well.  So let's look at some of those.  I could have this vector.  And that nectar over there and Laugh Factory over their length less than or equal to one. So now this this disk. All right. Is that solid disk? Is it a Subspace? I see you shaking your head. No, would you like to tell me why?  It's not closed under scalar multiplication. Exactly. So if I took this Vector down here, but I just drove this one here.  I can scale that one a little bit. I can scale it down and will stay in there and I can scale it up a little bit but I can scale it up also like that and then it won't be back in there for you always have to be able to scale no matter what if you ever fail to be back in the subset when you scale. That means you're not a Subspace. So there are some in there that leak and therefore the disc is not a Subspace.  That's what I was saying at the beginning of the lecture. If you're going to be a Subspace if we going to be a vector space it's not right now, but you have to go on forever and all the directions you do go in compact set like the the disc for the circle. Those are not IV subspaces.  Okay, good. I feel like we have a good handle on this idea of Subspace. So now  let's talk about another kind of example a couple of times already Fletcher. Every Subspace looks like this one and that is to say if I take any vectors in that space.  Then the span of those vectors is a Subspace.  That is a very important example. So let's do it in the case where we have two vectors.  And equals to 4 here so I fixed two vectors V1 and V2, then the span of those two.  That consists of all linear combinations of those two vectors.  That is the definition of Stan.  So I claimed that that thing is a Subspace to check that the Subspace. We just need to check that is closed under addition. So for the zero Vector if I just take  X1 and X2 both equal to zero  I see that the zero Vector is indeed in that span. So let's give it an ass is in s  so yes the span of any set of vectors contains the zero vector by taking all the linear combination linear combination coefficients to be 0  Now what if I take two things in there and add them up?  So if I take x1v 1 + X2 V2, that's some arbitrary element of the span and I add to it why one-v-one + Y2 V2 another arbitrary elements for to call Fashions. Y1 and Y2. Well, if I do that then I can recombine these things using the rules of addition and scalar multiplication to look like x 1 + y 1 x v 1 + 2 + Y 2 x V2 and that is indeed in the Spanish.  Okay, and similarly will see that I won't write it down, but we'll see that the Lambda x s is closed under skin of multiplication.  Well, I forgot how to write under.  scalar multiplication  As well so the span of any set of vectors in a vector space that is a Subspace of that space. And if you look back at the previous slide  There were two examples care that were subspaces the first one in the third one. So w and Bob.  And if you think about it a little bit those two are actually of the form span of some vectors here. So the first one up there ww.w is actually equal to the span.  Of the vector is 100 + 010.  Is the set of all linear combinations of 100 + 010?  Bob  Bob is the span of four matrices the span of the Matrix 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  010  000  000100 +  0000 * 1  Hey, it's a span of those for Matrix Matrix vectors. You take the The Matrix which has a one in each of those four slots were a b c and d are and zeros everywhere else and then you can just go right in the parametric solution of a homogeneous system of equations. You can just decompose that Matrix as a linear combination of those for.  So far, those are of this form they are spans of some vectors.  What's a good another example down here here is a subset of R3. It's a collection of vectors in R3 vectors of the form a + b for any choice of real numbers A&B through and it's not hard although it. Take a little bit of time to check that. This is a Subspace it contains if I said can be both equal to zero.  Is there a vector is there? That's the zero Factor when Andy about Sarah and I can just do that because I can do the same kind of trick and take this Vector here and decompose it as a * 120 + B * - 201  got - 211  The same sort of thing we did when we were talking about time. I took Solutions of homogeneous systems. So this set is actually equal to the span of those two vectors in R3 and so by the the statement above I don't need to check anything. It is the span of some vectors. Therefore. It is a Subspace.  All right. So that's what subspaces are there. Things are subsets already on vectorspace close in a bunch of examples of things that aren't now cuz they violate some of those properties The Collection collection of vectors in the vector space. We will see next day, but that's a universal truth. Every Subspace is the span of some set of factors. But before we get there now, I want to connect everything we've been doing back with stuff that we did before.  Want to talk about some special subspaces that are associated to Any Given system of equations.  So if I give you an a matrix a and for for now, we're going to be thinking of that Matrix a as the coefficient Matrix of a system of linear equations by animatrix Associated to it. There are two special study spaces.  Subspaces of what it will answer that question a minute. I don't mean they're going to subspaces of the space of matrices. Not that I am.  Text and let me just tell you they're definition. So I give you a matrix AI up here are two definitions the null space of the Matrix a  Is the set of all vectors?  X so that a x x equals 0  that's the definition of it.  And the other space is the column space of a and that's defined to be the set of all vectors of the form a x x where X is in our ends in m by n Matrix to access to be an RN.  It doesn't just the definitions will explore them in a bit here. But first, let's see, where where do these sets even live so then no space of a  Okay, it is a set of vectors x x of the size that a x x makes sense. So if if a is an M by n Matrix S A X has to be a vector in r n  whereas the column space of a  call space of a is a set of vectors of the form a x x if x is a vector that I can most buy a bias in a vector in r n e x x is of size M if x is an by one and a day is M by n then the vector is am by one. So this is a subset of RM.  Space is a subset of the domain of the range. They live in different spaces typically.  So what are these things that I just Define ad nauseam for the x equals zero in other words, this is the solution set.  of the homogeneous system  Who is a coefficient Matrix is a?  That's something that you guys know how to compute for any particular Matrix. I will do it any sample at the end of electric in a few minutes just to cement that again. So this is unimportant subset. We're looking at the solution set of a system of equations in particular the homogeneous solution set for some coefficient Matrix. The column space is the set of all things of the form a x x. So, let's write that out out. I'll do it over here. We have a little more space. So that means if I take my Matrix a and I write it in terms of its columns.  Does an columns cause an M by n Matrix?  Set a x x is of the form x 1 a OnePlus x 2 A2 plus all the way up to XNA m r definition of matrix multiplication. So it's the set of all vectors of that form for all possible vectors X in other words. It is the span of The Columns of a  that's why it's called the column space. Hey, it's the space consisting of the span of the columns.  We just saw on the last slide that the cut the span of some collection of vectors in a space in a vector space is a Subspace. So this thing the column space is a Subspace. It is the span of the vectors that are The Columns of the Matrix. What about the first one that I called it a space? So the null space. Is that a Subspace?  Well, let's explore that question.  Answer that question. So the theorem is it is a Subspace text. The column space is a Subspace of the range of our normal.  The domain of RN so they can't be compared with each other to do it. Let's let's get a proof of this or let's outline. First of all the column space.  Is the span of the columns?  you just said  the span of some vectors is always a Subspace.  As we saw two slides to go check. So what about the null space? So the null space is we said  that is equal to the set of vectors X for which a x equals 0 the definition of Subspace. We need to verify 3 sings is the zero Vector in this subset.  Is the zero Vector in the null space? What does it mean from the definition for asking is zero one of those in other words we're just asking is it true that a times 0 is 0  Is that true?  Yeah.  so that means how about the sum of two things in the null space if I have two vectors X and Y that are both in the null-space of a  is x + y in the null space of a that's what we need to check. Okay? Well this question is  Is it true that?  A * x + y equals 0 that's what we need to check given to actors in The null Space X and Y. Is there some one of those vectors such that a X Factor is 0  well  Are we going to see that that's true. We're going to use the Matrix operations the vector operations and note that a x x + y.  by the distributive property of matrix multiplication equal to a x x + a x y  No exes in the null space.  and that tells us that this thing is 0 a * X Y is in the null space of a and that tells us that this thing is there a  Therefore this thing is 0 + 0 which is 0 check.  And then the remaining question we have to ask is.  Is Lambda * X in the null-space of a?  If x is in the null space of a and that means we need to check is a x Lambda x equal to 0 whenever a x x is and here again, we use the properties of matrix multiplication Lambda being a scalar we can pull through.  That's always true a x 3 x is equal to 3 times x that was one of the true false questions on your midterm.  And this again?  Is equal to this is equal to 0 so, this is Lambda * 0.  So I get zero and yes so that we have an any scalar multiple of space. And so we have no verified both of these statements proven this there.  Okay, both the column space on the null space are subspaces that might sound very abstract, but it's not at all. It's just observations of things that you've been working with all along. So let's just finish here. I'll have to continue the last by the next day but there's two minutes left and we can do in those two minutes long. So here is an example of an egg.  The Matrix a so this one is 3 by 5  And I'm giving you the registration form of that Matrix in Matlab calculated that for me. So I want to write down. What is the null space of a welt been no space of a is the solution set.  The homogeneous system of equations. That's something that I know exactly how to compute. Okay to figure out what the solution set is. I look at the reduced row Echelon form and I can just write it down the solution set X1 X2 X3 X4 X5.  It will I look for the free variables and so here that's a free variable and that's a free variable and that's a free variable. Those are free variables.  Okay, and that means it in the general solution set. I'm going to get x2 and X4 and X5 as parameters. You know, I like to rename. So let's do that that's called them asks t&r  I know the first equation there says x 1 + 2 x 2 + x 4 - 3 x 5 is equal to 0 and the second equation says that x 3 - 2 x 4.  + 2 x 5 is equal to 0 and there is our general parametric solutions that a little quickly right now cuz we're just at the end here but you should go through and do the calculation for yourself to verify that you were a member and are confident how to do that. Let me just do one more step and write this up as ask * 21000 + 10 * 100 - 210 + r * - 30201  And what we see here, is that the no space.  Is exactly the span of those three vectors?  So the null space is always the way you worked out how to always figure out what the null space is what the solution set of the homogeneous system of equations is is to always write in parametric form which always produces a solution set that is written as the span of some vectors. So that's a Subspace new language to describe something you already confident about doing we will continue that discussion on "
