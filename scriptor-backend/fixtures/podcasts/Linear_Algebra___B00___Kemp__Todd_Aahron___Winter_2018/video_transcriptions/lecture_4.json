Let me briefly mention the usual administrative that you have homework MyMathLab homework 1 and homework 2 are both due this coming Monday, January 22nd by 11:59 p.m. In the system and you have not lab homework with this Friday 11:59 p.m. Go before it's just a minute before midnight Friday, though. If you are already enrolled in the class that you've already been signed up for enrolled in an account for you'll submit that homework.  If you are still on the waitlist haven't been enrolled in gradescope yet. We're not going to enroll you until you are enrolled in the class and rolling on gradescope takes very little time. You should prepare that homework set according to the instructions that are listed in it for how you upload it. And then if then we will enroll you in time for you. If the timing doesn't work out in your late because you were controlled in time. Don't worry. We will take care of that this time. Okay, we're not going to give you a zero on that assignment because we couldn't enjoy on the class until the last minute will will make sure that works out. So don't worry about that briefly take that Segway to mention. They're still 80 people on the waitlist for my to lectures.  And the reality is you're not all going to get into the class. There are restrictions placed by the fire. Marshal. We cannot overload the class to more than 10% of the room capacity. If we do with the fire marshal comes in next week, which you probably will do a shutdown Centre Hall for the whole day. That's the threat that we've been told and so they really don't want more than 10% I wish we had another lecture for you guys to go to the reality is that if you're really far down the waitlist at this point, you're probably not going to get into the class this quarter and if that happens then email me after you don't get in the class and we'll make sure that you get preferential enrollment opportunities next quarter or the next quarter you want to take it finalized tomorrow to buy Friday, you will know for sure whether you're in the class or not as many of you as we are allowed to  Okay.  If you're coming in now, there are a few more seats. I see two seats over here three seats over here a please try to sit in the seat and not in the Isles.  Without disturbing those around you. So please try to make sure you come early to this class as it's still going to be oversubscribed for a while.  Alright, I'd like to continue now with what we were doing last day. So today we're going to be doing Vector equations and Matrix equations sections 1.3 and 1.4 in your textbook.  More detailed description of solution sets of linear systems. I want to start today with a review from the side that we finished with last day.  So there were two new pieces of terminology that we learned last day linear combination and span we're going to be using those words every lecture from here until the end of the quarter. So you need to make sure you are totally comfortable with them.  The linear combinations are vectors that are constructed from other vectors using the operations. So if I have some collection of un and might be seven and might be a million in some space.  I said they might be 10 dimensional vectors in might be two dimensional vectors.  the given some collection of vectors of some say they're both two vectors in R2  And I am going to add up a scalar multiple of the first or the second to give some linear combination. Let's do.  Let's do - to the first Spectre plus the second factor. That is an example of a scalar multiple. Let's see where that I want to multiply the first Spectre the red vector by -2  that means  let me do it in a darker line here. That means this Vector here.  Hey, that's - 2 X - 1 1.  I want to add that to the blue tractor and we use the parallelogram law which says I just construct the parallelogram with those two as two of its sides and that means that I'm going to  connect  And the sum is that Vector there?  Now we could read off what the coordinates are there by counting and looking at the condition, but this is not really the best way to compute linear combinations.  Really? All we have to do is use the vector addition and multiplication. That's 2 * 2 - 2  plus 2 1  Add vectors are the components.  So 2 + 2 is 4 - 2 + 1 is -1 * 4 - 1  so that is an example of a linear combination there infinitely many linear combinations of these two vectors combination of the two factors. So we're interested in the set of all possible combinations of those two vectors of a collection of finite set of three vectors is the set of all linear combinations of them as some linear combination of vectors.  Hey, that's this man. So is that one there? But I just drove the vector 4-1 is an example of an element of the span of a vector that's already on this picture. That is  yes.  Sorry, excellent. The zero Vector is always in the span of any set of vectors cuz I could just take one plus three times. The second one gives me the zero Vector that's always in the span of any other vectors that are already on this picture that are in the span of The Originals.  Good, the vectors themselves the coefficients of the first one to be one and the second one to be zero K so I can always get the same vectors back by taking a one in front of the house.  Any other vectors besides - 1121 and the one we write a John 4-1 and 0 that are already on this picture.  Other is at least one more Vector. That's a drawn. It's the vector - 2 x - examples of vectors in the span, but this man spends a much larger set of vectors. It's always your only adding it to itself when you multiply a vector by a scalar you just get zero so that keeps the span is just the zero Vector the span is an infinite set.  So in this case, you can probably guess and will be able to verify this in a few minutes that for those two vectors. The span is actually the entire plane. It's all are two linear combination of those two vectors.  How would we prove that? Well, let's look at an example that relates.  74 - 3  And are sneeze, what are three? Cuz it's a list of three numbers. Is it in the span question?  No, I'd like to hear your explanation by looking at all. It's a really hard question. If you could try to do it naively without any mathematical tools know we can try to answer a geometrically by drawing very careful pictures to my torso is 5/6 supposed Becker's looks like  Yes a playing what's playing?  Is it the plane of the floor of the wall?  Yep, that's the plan for the two vectors. That is probably the best answer you but it's this that's the Spanish is not in the span of vectors putting us through my head is not was represented by my head is down here. Maybe it is not many of you are talented enough artist to make that convincingly work. I'm certainly not going to try but really that's not the right way to do it.  What's the definition? What is it we're asking.  the question is can  Express  not vector  74 - 3  in the Forum  I want to know whether I can write as a linear combination of these two vectors over here. Meaning. Can I find some scalar X1?  and some scalar X2  74 - 3 is equal to x 1 * 1 - 2 + x in other words. I want to solve I want to ask whether I can solve the following vector equation.  Hey, this is a vector equation is an equation between two vectors. And what were solving for are the coefficients X1 and X2. Can we find coefficient next to Old strip?  if so, then  now you see why we even talking about the important question of given a linear system. Can I answer the question? Does it have a solution right without necessarily finding the solution because they have a solution. I'm not asking you to find the solution not exactly what was writing a linear system of equations use the vector operations to rewrite this. So X1 times at first Vector is x 1 - 2 x 1 - 5 x 1  and x 2 x that second Vector is 2 x 2/5 x 2 6X 2  and now let me use the rule for how I add vectors component by component to write this out as the first converter. The Spectre is x 1 + 2 x 2.  -2 x 1 + 5 x 2 + -5 x 1 + 6 x 2 so I'm asking so that the vector with those three component components seven four minus three components of a system of linear equations. It's the system x 1 + 2 x 2 equals 7.  -2 x 1 + 5x to equals 4 + -5 x 1 + 6 x 2 equals -3 system of equations 3 equations in two unknowns  How do we solve such a system?  Row reduction. Someone says weekly come on. I want everybody to see how do we solve such a system?  Row reduction, okay.  We would write the augmented Matrix just by putting the coefficients 1/2.  7 - 254 + - 5 6-3 working on the last for lectures three lectures.  Look up here at the top.  look at those two and  that one and I'll look down here.  If you are asked is the certain Vector in the side of his other vectors to answer that question all of the bank of the coefficient Matrix being the ones that you're asking do they spend this other vector and the vector you asking is it in the span it goes on the right hand side of the equal sign. That's the trick here. So when were asking such a question, we just write down the augmented Matrix immediately. And now now we do  Row reduction. Okay. So let me do the row reduction here for practice. So I'm going to try to get a zero below the leading one in the one 1 entry in the second row. I'm going to add twice the first row to the second row for the result in the second row.  That's going to give me my desired 0 there that's going to give me a 9 here and it's going to give me an 18 here.  And then simultaneously I'm going to do the third row, which means I'm going to multiply the first row by 5 and add it to the third row for the result in the third row giving me the desired 0 they're going to give me 16 and 32 in the third position.  Okay, so now I've got my zeros below the leading one in the First Column. Next thing I need to do is well, I can do a number of things, but I'm going to convert this to a leading one in the second column.  So I'm going to divide road to by 9.  Get 1/2 there.  I know is this Matrix in row Echelon form?  No, yes, or no.  Does everybody stand up?  The energy in this room is too loud or buddy stand up.  Okay, we're all going to do five jumping jacks right now ready and  Okay, let's try that question again.  Is this Matrix in row Echelon form?  Because there is a 16 below.  Right still deleting entry of the third row is not to the right.  So I'm going to multiply.  Road to buy - 16 added to Roastery put the result in Row 3.  and I guess  what's well, I guess it is Art 0 there and 2 * 16 subtracted from 32 is 0.  This Matrix used in real life Salon Forum not a reduced row Echelon form. But remember all we want to answer is is the system consistent doesn't have a solution.  Does the system have a solution?  Absolutely. There's a row of all zeros at the bottom. There's no 0 equals 5 time inconsistency. So the system does have a solution third spinal augmented column is not pivotal there for the system is consistent.  And so we can answer the question the vector 7 4-3 in the span of those yes or no?  Because the associated system is consistent.  No, in fact we could go further and say look I've actually already solved for X2 and I could do back substitution here to solve for x 1 reduced row Echelon form and I'll see that it is uniquely soft  So we can not only but there's only one way to write it next to.  what if  I had gone through all of this and instead of a zero down here suppose that I had gotten like a V down here.  Then what would the answer to the question for Ben?  No, because that would say oh the third column is pivotal. That means there's an inconsistency R equals 5 type equation here. In fact, and the system is inconsistent, which means that no by definition. You cannot write that Vector 7 4-3 as a linear combination of the first two  Okay, everybody got that.  That is Vector equations. And that is how you determine whether a vector is in the span of some others.  And it's just different language for stuff. We've already done a vector equation is just a different way to write some linear equations and questions about linear combination and span of vectors immediately translate two questions of consistency for those Associated systems of linear equations.  Okay, so that's a doctor equations.  So just to emphasize the point. I just made the question is W in the span of vectors V1 V2 in VN is the same as the question is the system whose augmented matrix by putting the vectors V1 sirvientas The Columns. Is that system consistent?  Hey, that's the equivalent population and how to compute these things to answer this question. We use.  row reduction  to carry the segmented Matrix 2  Row Echelon form you don't need to go to all the way to reduced row Echelon form just to answer the question. Is it consistent?  And we check to see if okay. Well and here's the thing. I want you to remember. What is the technical condition in row Echelon form that tells you whether or not it's somebody.  Yes.  The final column is not pivotal check to see if the augmented column.  Is pivotal or not if it is pivotal that story on how you determine mechanically if a vector is generated by two given vectors?  So that's the whole story on Vector equations.  So now I want to go to section 1.4 and talk about Matrix equations, which if you read ahead, you know also is just slightly different language for the same thing. It's going to reduce to linear equations. But first we need to talk about what we mean by a matrix equation.  Cancel together. We need to understand matrix multiplication. How many people saw some something about matrix multiplication before this class?  Okay, healthy healthy plurality of you at least.  So you've already had in the book. So you've already seen this.  So we can multiply matrices together if they have the right sizes for now.  An M by n Matrix, we always use those letters m by n which is a travesty because it's very hard to hear the difference between m and n p by 2 Matrix, but the textbook uses Eminem. So so does every Matrix is and columns and denotes the number of columns.  So suppose we have an M by n Matrix, which means that I could think of it as stringing together and column vectors.  column vectors are my  dimensional vectors X which is n-dimensional Vector ex has to actually have number of components equal to the number of columns in a Nazi. The number of rows that's critical care if the Matrix a square then there's no difference.  So another words of the column Vector whose number and adventurous matches the number of columns.  Then we can multiply 8 * X and here's how that's defined. And this makes it immediately clear why the number of entries of X has to equal the number of columns of a by definition a x axis computed just by using those components X.  and multiplying them by The Columns of a  Okay, so really matrix multiplication is just a shorthand notation for linear combinations. So I want to say look I've got these vectors A1 through a.m. And I want to take a pickle a linear combination of them with coefficients X-14 X-Men one way to write that down is to write it as the Matrix a columns are those vectors X Factor when I put together the components X1 X2.  That's the definition of multiplying a matrix times a column Vector of the appropriate size. So for example  What size is this Matrix?  3 by 7  3 by 2 so it has three rows to columns. So m is equal to 3. So this is it have the right size to be able to do this matrix multiplication.  Yeah, it has two entries. So that matches the number of columns so I can do the matrix multiplication and by definition a column Vector in The Matrix.  second entry 7 * the second column entry in The Matrix and vector addition, so  + 7 x - 3 which is -21 for the first entry signature is 4 * 8 which is 32 + 7 * 004 x - 5 which is -20 + 7 * 2 which is 14.  and so I get 8 - 21 is -13  32 + -6  I didn't make any mistakes.  So that is the result of multiplying that 3 by 2 matrix by that two-dimensional column Vector. That's the definition of matrix multiplication. Again, it's really just a shorthand for doing the appropriate linear combination of The Columns of The Matrix.  Okay. Alright, so I meant to erase this conversation here before lecture so I could do it in front of you. But you know what it's already written there. So let's just look there's a second example, if we don't need to run through it, you can check it later. So here is a 3 by 3 Matrix has three rows and 3 columns. That means that I can x a three dimensional vector and the definition is just I take the first component four times the First Column plus the second component three times the second column plus the third column the third entry seven times the third column and do the vector operations and and there is the arithmetic which I don't really need to do in front of you but you should do several examples like this to make sure you've got it straight.  Also go backwards and that's going to give us some good intuition about how much boost mobile location can be used to relate to linear equations.  So for example I said that matrix multiplication is just a shorthand way for expressing certain linear combinations. So let's do that supposed to give you three vectors. I'm not telling you what they are. Here are three letters you want you to and you three there Collins actors of some size.  I want you to write the linear combination. That's written there as a matrix product as a matrix multiplication.  I would like you to tell me what is the column Vector that we're going to use in this matrix product.  Somebody give you 10 seconds to work that I'm going to ask for an answer here. Go ahead.  You can talk to your neighbor as usual if you like.  So just to be clear what I'm asking Kira's I want you to write this thing.  As a matrix a x a vector X and I'm asking you what is that Vector EX?  Give you another 10 seconds.  Start the somebody think they know what Vector to use their.  Yes.  437  Where you getting 437 from?  So I know that's so this example of here has nothing to do with this example down here.  Turn around at 4. Yes to -3/8 right? That's very important. Here. Are these vectors you and you too and you three they could be 78 dimensional right or they could be yesterday's closing closing stock stock prices on the S&P 500 or whatever. They are there. I don't care what they are. I'm just asking you to find the product as I string together the columns. I don't know what they are. But I just write them as you want you to he was three.  Time is the vector 2 - 3/8.  Does it matter that I don't know what dimension The Columns you want to hear?  I don't know. What M is for this Matrix. I don't know how many rows there are but that when your combination can be written as the Matrix was called time is the vector 2 - 3 day. I don't need to know the size of the Rose to be able to do the matrix multiplication. It just needs to be that the column vector.  has number of components equal to the number of columns in The Matrix a  the matrix multiplication again to summarize is just a concise way of representing linear combinations.  Alright, so now we know what makes multiplication is and how to do it now. We can talk about Matrix equations.  So let's go back way back to your first introduction to algebra probably in 7th or 8th grade, depending where your from could be earlier could be later.  The most basic algebra equation is the equation x equals B for some coefficients a and b equals 3.  How do you solve that system? How do you solve ax equals B for x?  It's true.  The Matrix is a one-by-one matrix and the augmented part is be so you have a matrix.  Hey, this is equivalent to the linear system by the method Matrix AV.  How do we answer whether we can solve how do we solve that we have to convert it to reduced row Echelon form?  Which it almost is already. We just have to Pivot if it turns that a into a one right so we have to divide through by a on that row and we. That's the solution x equals y over X on one by one systems of equations because of a has zero we can't do that. I didn't say is zero then that system is generally not solvable day is there always says 0 equals B, which has a solution only a vehicle? Otherwise, it's inconsistent.  Okay, so that's the most basic algebra equation is an example of a linear equation.  So now let's look at a matrix generalization of this. So suppose. I have a matrix A and M by n Matrix and a vector B in RM SOB is going to be a vector that matches The Columns of a not the number of columns, but it has to have the same height as The Columns of a  The question is can we solve The Matrix equation ax equals B 4X. We want to find a vector X or answer the question. Is there a x so that a x x equals B?  9 order for that to make sense. He has to have the right size to start because it is going to be a linear combination of The Columns of a which means it's going to be a vector in r m and so for the equation to even make sense for a veteran question, can you solve this matchup then we can at least ask the question.  Can I solve a system of equations? Can I solve this Matrix equation?  So let's do an example to demonstrate how this is really exactly question. Like we've already done everyday so far. So here's an example 3 by 3 Matrix there and be equal to that three by one column vector.  So if I want to solve this, let's write it out very explicitly ax equals B.  okay, this means I'm multiplying 1 and 3/4 - 426 - 327 * this unknown common factor x 1 x 2 x 3  So let's use Matrix. Mocha this use the definition of matrix multiplication. That means I take x 1 x the first column 1 - 4 - 3 + 2 * the second column 322 + x 3 * the third column for 6 7.  And I'm asking can I solve this? Can I find X1 X2 and X3 equals B.  Is 101 in this case? So this Matrix equation has become what kind of equation?  A vector equation Matrix equation is a vector equation. It's just a different way of writing down a vector equation.  And now we do what we did to solve that vector equation, which is well, we could continue to write it in and then write down the system of equations or we can jump straight away from here or directly from here. Now that we know how this works and we just write down the system 1 3/4 - 426 - 3 2 7 with augmentin  I know.  We solve the system by doing row reduction.  Okay, so now we do row operations.  To get to row Echelon form.  To answer the question of whether we can solve the system and if we want to actually find the solution or Solutions if it's consistent, then we have to do reduced row Echelon form to find the solution.  If the system is consistent.  And if it is not consistent, then we're in the situation like we mentioned up above where a was equal to 0 right in that case. We can't solve the system unless were the special kids were abused also now we know for matrices that is a little more complicated that it's not just a question of whether at the Matrix a equals 0 or not. We can get different kinds of inconsistencies we can get we could have the whole Matrix A10 Envy was not that would certainly be inconsistent. But really the question is when we reduce this Matrix form do we get zeros in a corporation part and a nonzero thing on the right hand side if the equation is consist, it has a solution or not, but the idea is  So I'm not going to go through the actual reduction here. I think we've done plenty of row reduction already knew more but you know what to do. Now. Is there a 100 by 3 to add to the third to get the zero under that leading in the third row and proceeded to get that nice staircase we're looking for so that we are in route to check whether the final column is pivotal. If it isn't the system is consistent. We know we'll be able to find a solution set anonib solution set and produce an exact description of it by doing all the way to reduce Russia want form.  And you've already been doing lots of examples of that on your homework. So that's what you do from here. So that's Matrix equations.  And so let's summarize again what we just said and what we saw that example. So suppose I give you a matrix equation x equals be aligned up here so that the size is matched so that it's possible to most by LAX to be a vector whose number of components is equal to the number of columns in The Matrix a is a vector in the same space as The Columns of a it's a vector whose components is equal to the number of rows. Then we can even ask the question is ax equals solvable and the answer is x equals we can be solved if and only if B is a something of The Columns of a  Let's look back at the other slide.  Okay, look right here.  Right here.  so remember that that system of equations  The Matrix equation x equals be in this case becomes this vector equation and this vector equation saying that this picture equation is solvable says that the vector 101 is a  Linear combination of The Columns of a that's what it means to say that the ax equals B. It means that she is only if B is a linear combination.  of The Columns of a  and just to emphasize the point that we have a word for this the set of linear combinations of a collection of vectors is called the  the span  avocado survey  Just in case the symbol is is messing you up this symbol here. It takes just as much time to write it as writing in I would prefer to just write in but your textbook uses the symbol at the standard mathematical symbol. So you need to make sure you get used to it.  So for example, let's look at this Matrix a here that by the way is the same Matrix we had over here. That's the Matrix a from the last slide. And by the way, let me tell you that the answer in this place if you actually go through it the answer is yes.  And moreover the reduced row Echelon form.  Of a of that system look like this.  Okay with some things on this side, if you go through it, you'll see that's what it looks like.  Okay.  so knowing that  Can you solve ax equals B care for some other B?  Hey, so suppose actually a more delicate question here is okay. I could I know what to do for a specific example. I want to answer the question. Can I solve ax equals B. Where a is a specific Matrix Envy as a specific column vector?  But now I want to answer the slightly stronger question. Can I solve for any choice of B?  Or are there some bees for which it doesn't work? No, remember?  As we set up above the question of whether x equals B can be solved is the same as the question of whether B is in the span of The Columns of a b is a linear combination of The Columns of a three-dimensional space. The answer was certainly going to be no question because the span of these two vectors is a plane in three dimensional space and there are not in that plane.  So there will be some vectors like this one that far in the stand and some vectors many factors that are not. So the question can ask that question in that case is has the answer no.  But what about in this example here? I have three vectors in three dimensions. Doesn't mean that those vectors are going to spend all of our three for example, take the vectors this line.  The line along the line along the bottom of the chalkboard here and this flying here this Vector here. So these three vectors there are three vectors and think about them there in three dimensional space. They just all happened to lie in the plane of the Black Fork.  Those three vectors cannot be used to construct.  The vector sticking out of the board as a linear combination.  So just doesn't mean that they stand three dimensional space.  So the question is do those three dimensional space to answer that question.  We need to take the Matrix.  Okay.  Need to take that Matrix and append to it this unknown Vector B.  to find that  augmented system with an unknown V on that side and then we need to carry it to reduced row Echelon form or at least two row Echelon form doing on your homework or you have an h and a K in some places there unknown constants you need to answer is the system consistent for all values of H, or call the coefficients of BH K&L and goes through the earth going to be painful but not impossible but the important thing to realize  when I do this  When I do this when I do row operations on this Matrix, they're going to be exactly the same row operations. We used on this one over here.  Hey, so we do row operations and the purpose of the row operations is to convert the coefficient Matrix to its reduced row Echelon form.  So whatever operations we chose to do that those were determined by the coefficient Matrix column on the right. It's not going to change what row operations I do to the Matrix on the left. So what that means?  Operations to convert The Matrix a to reduced row Echelon form no matter what column B I have on the right. I'm going to get the same reduced row Echelon form.  On the left and I told you that for that Matrix it was this one over here.  But the question is whatever that Vector B is.  Do I actually have a solution to this system? No matter what is on the right hand side. And the answer in this case is yes, because no matter what is on the right hand side there. I've already solved 4 x 4 X1 X2 and X3 here. This is X3 the bottom thing X.  Okay, so  The answer to the question. Can I sell vehicles x equals B for every B?  Is a question about a alone?  Okay, and it's a question that can be answered by operations on a  it doesn't matter what the answer for what the solution X1 X2 X3 looks like but the question of whether or not I can solve it only depends on it.  So is every vector be in the span?  of The Columns of a  and the question depends only on this case if what I told you was right and the registration form is that identity Matrix with one's on the diagonals are as everywhere else. The answer is yes, but if I had a zero down zero here on things above it, then the answer would be no there would be some vectors be I can put there so that I would get 0005 over there. So it's just a question of the salon form of a matrix equation for every be so I'll just finish with this theorem.  From your textbook. Okay. So this is a restatement of what was just said suppose I give you a matrix a  and I want to ask the question. Can I solve x equals B for every single be for anybody? I choose I can always solve ax equals B and that is equivalent to what by definition is equivalent to every be being a linear combinations of columns of a or alternatively just from definition. Is it saying that the columns of a span all of our m?  And the way you check if that's true is to look at just the coefficient Matrix a and ask if it has a pivot in each and every row. Hey, that's what we said on this last flight here. If you had a zero in the last row here, then you're going to find some bees for which this thing has an inconsistent equation. But if you have a pivot in every single row, then you will be able to solve it no matter what the stars are on the right hand side.  Okay, we'll continue with that discussion. "
