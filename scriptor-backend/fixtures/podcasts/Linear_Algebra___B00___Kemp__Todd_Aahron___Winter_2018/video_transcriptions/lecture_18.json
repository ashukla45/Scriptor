You're responsible for stop 2 chapter 3 is everything we did since the last midterm until chapter 3 has been dealt one step on top of the other. But specifically testing you on this exam will be and up to and including determinants and I'll post specifically which sections on the course webpage when I make this big announcement later today or tomorrow about the topics for the midterm as well as some practice midterms just like last time when I said administrivia, and now let's continue with the course material for today, which is determinants. We defined last day in general. What is a terminal to determine a function that takes?  Now, what does that number mean? Hopefully will answer that question in a few ways today.  But we saw how to compute it. We started with the to buy tickets with an explicit formula. And then we saw this recursive way to generalize that two larger matrices called the cofactor expansion where you take any row or column you expand a lot of that row or column with some plus and minus signs determined by 6 checkerboard pattern from the size of the Matrix and then you add up a linear combination of the entries on that Roar column X some smaller determinants size smaller corresponding to The End by n -1 by n -1 matrices you get fight deleting the row and column that the entry you're interested in isn't.  We did a bunch of practice with that if you're working on your homework already. So hopefully you've done a bunch of examples of mechanical good with doing those competitions. Why only because I need you to understand the definition not because I ever want you to actually computer determinants. I mean on the midterm, you will probably have to compute to demonstrate that you know the definition but no human being should ever actually if you determine its that way neither should any computer as we talked about last algorithm from the definition the cofactor expansion to calculate determinants unfathomable amount of time for computer science Majors when you hear that are just getting up and leaving the room because that means it's not if it's not  No computer can reasonably do it ever but that's okay because that's not the way you would actually computer determine what I want to discuss at least on the process of what we're getting through today actually compute the determinant, it's harder to Define it the way I'm going to show that it will actually be computed.  But it's it is the fastest way to compute determinants and we're going to see how that comes about. Okay, of course just like everything else in his class the way we're going to come by.  We'll see in a moment how that works. In order to get there. We need to understand some properties of this determinant function so that we can understand. What does the determinants.  So the the first observation I want to make is well. This is a class in linear algebra.  And we have this function determinants so I can input a matrix 1 by 1 Matrix. So you might think this should be a linear transformation. Well, it's not determinants are not linear things closely related to linear algebra linear function. So what I mean by that is if I take the determinant  of a matrix scale that Matrix example of a box  This is a demonstration.  So here's a matrix.  And what is its determinant * 1 - 0 * 1  No, what if I were to take?  Matrix and thinking of it as a vector scale it so I X some scalar X to so that gives me the Matrix 2 0 0 2  Do you know if the determinant function for a linear transformation we know how this would have to go the function of 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 - 0 * 0 which is not equal to 2 * 1.  Okay, It does not respect because multiplying a matrix by 2 is the same as adding to itself. So we see here the determinants of Pi.  I think the temperature is not a linear function not linear transformation. That means that it doesn't have a matrix. That means that it's not something we have better tools for analyzing.  But it's not all bad. It does have some properties related to linear transformation. In fact, it is what's called multilinear the fancy word, but it has a simple meaning and what it means is this I've got the determinant here is function of the recursive formula for how we actually whatever it is. It produces some function of all the entries.  Get some combination of the entries that has polynomials but let's think of the Matrix as very only in one row. So here's a matrix in the first row. I'll think of it as a variable Vector. I'm in the second and third rows are fixed like that. One of the determinants as a function not alcohol Matrix, but just of that first row has fixed equal to some random choices.  I claimed it that function is a linear transformation. So if I take the determinant of this Matrix here with entries in the first row being some parameters.  The function of that is actually a linear transformation. Meaning that the determinant of that nature is the same as the determinants. When is the sum of two things of two other rows right? One row X1 X2 X3 and the second row y 1 Y 2 y 3 first row by itself and then look at it some of us in the first row.  We go back to our definition of the determinant we use the cofactor expansion. So that means the first thing we do is remember the sign pattern.  I know I'm going to choose any row or column to expand along but just to make things easier for the I'm going to go ahead and choose to expand along. The first row is the one that we're thinking of as the variable here. So what that says?  Is that okay? The cofactor expansion tells me what I do is I take the first entry which is X1 + y one of the stuff down here.  1 4 -1 - 5  okay.  Great. Now the next thing I do is move on to the next entry in the first row that I'm expanding alone.  So that's X2 + Y2 x -1 from the sign pattern and I take the determinant of everything that is not in the first and the second column. Thanks. So that means that I'm looking at these entries.  That's a determinant of 2-3 4-5.  And then finally I go to the third entry in the first row during the cofactor expansion x 3 + y 3 x a + 1 again.  time is the determinant of the stuff that's left over which is 231 - 1  Okay, so that's just the first step of the cofactor expansion. If I were going to write this whole thing out then I would now calculate those three to a two determinants and simplify everything but that's not my goal. My goal is not to give you a number if you're my goal is to relate this.  To the determinant of the original Matrix, but without a thumb.  Turn the entry so how do we do that? Well, we just noticed that in each one of these terms. I've got an X1 + 2y 1 or next to each one of them is the sum of two terms. So let me write it is all six times together organized like this. So this time is this determinant  a 1/4 - 1 - 5 + y 1 x the determinant of 1/4 - 1 - 5  The second term is X2 - X2. Does that minus sign their - x 2 x - 5 x the determiner of 243 - 5 x 3 x want to 3-1 that thing.  Pus-y is three times the determinant of that thing.  Haven't really done anything except expand out ignore look at just the one with the exit. The one was just the X's is a cofactor expansion.  It is exactly the cofactor expansion that we would use to compute the determinant.  The Matrix with the x's in the first row and those same entries in the second and third  And the second row the one with the wise.  Where I have just the wise in the first row and those same constants in the second and third.  So here's what I see. I see that the determinant of a matrix whose row is a sum of two other factors is the sum of the determinants of the two matrices with the same bottom two rows Frozen and then I put the determinants what that says exactly.  the determinants  is linear  in each row separately  holding  the others fixed  Hey, so if I hold all the roads, but one fixed.  And think of the determinant of this Matrix is the function of just that it is a linear transformation of just that row. That's exactly what this says.  I've only shown it in this one special case. I don't return it for the first roll.  We get the same thing not only is the determinant a linear function of each row separately.  I've only shown that it's respect some is here, but it's even easier to show that it respect scalar multiplication in each row or column fixed column there.  That's a super important property of determinants to understand how the determinant behaves when we perform row operations on The Matrix.  So let's let's look at operations. So I give you a square Matrix because I don't want to keep writing more variables are more rows, but all of these things work.  3 by 3 Matrix zero constant  What happens to the determinant when I do that?  Okay, so I start with a matrix a I want to know what it is.  And if I can track how the determinant for the row reduced Matrix instead and keep track of all the changes as I go.  This one actually follows from what we did on the last plaid.  I said that holding any looking at anyone row as the variable is the variable that the determinant is a linear transformation that one row in particular memes that respect scalar multiplication.  So from the last fight we get immediately that this is the same thing as if I take  that Matrix without that scalar there.  the original Matrix  And take it to terminate the determinant is linear, which means I have to pull out that one over Pete. That's all so from the linearity in the first row or in any Row in fact.  If I do a pivot row operation that changes the determinant that pivot X that pivot.  Now be careful with this means though is I'm interested in actually calculating this thing. I want to know what this determines and then I do operation and I have the thing on the left. So really what I want to do is X that P if I give you an A and I say what's the determinant of the first row by 2. So I / 2 what that means is that you're multiplying by two?  Okay, so that's how pivot operations behave that's how they determine operations. Now. How about the second kind of operation of the second kind of operation is that I X some number and then I add the results and then replace that the first roll * 3 added to the second row and replace the brake and we do so what happens when we do that what happened to the determinant the first step of what happens there of that row reduced Matrix there?  Think of the first and third rows as fixed now cuz they are the determinants is linear in each row. They holding the other aspects that determinant with the second row being a song as the multiple and some of the determinants.  Just like I've written there.  Okay. Well, that's a nice relationship cuz it tells me once I've done the row reduction I get back to something over here.  That involves the determinant of the original Matrix that operation times the determinant of a matrix in the old one of the Rose repeated has been replaced and I have the first row repeat it.  Not clear how helpful that is right now cuz now I've taken a minute and turn it into that first term. There is no problem at all.  So for example, it might be that there's a zero in the one 1 entry it. So that's what I've done here in the question is how do these two determinants relate to each other?  This one isn't covered by the first slide wit it. This is not a linear transformation of a single fixed can go back to the cofactor expansion definition of determinant to see what happens because I'm over here in the first one if we use the cofactor expansion.  Let's do it with a specific example. Let's say one two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine.  Between the first two that's 4 5 6 1 2 3 7 8 9.  So in this first example here.  Let me go ahead and expand along the first row. When I write my signed pattern to remember how the signs go in the cofactor.  I'm going to get his + 1 times the determinant of 4 6 8 9.  -2  You're right. It is 5. Thank you.  -2 * 4679 + 3 * the determinant of 4 5 7 8  Now I can keep going if I want the number. But again, I'm not interested in the number. I'm interested in the property is here what happens if I hear? Well, I'm going to different looking calculations if I stand along the first row again, but I don't have to expend along the first row. I can choose whichever. I want to expand a long stiletto.  okay, and then from that when I'm going to get is  1 * the stuff that's left over 5 6 8 9  -2 *  4679  Plus  3 * 457 94578  right  No, no fun.  You guys are too quick for me. Okay, I shouldn't try to make these intentional mistakes cuz I know you're going to catch him right away. I can't fool you right so for this one over here.  the first sign  is that plus but it's the same pattern we have to use over here.  So now that first sign is a minus and they're all reversed from the ones we had before plus minus.  It looks almost exactly the same.  The only difference is an overall factor of -1 and that's what happens here in general. If I swap two rows. The only effect that has on the determinant is to change it.  And now we know how determinants behave under all three row operations modulo. 2nd wonder the real Workhorse which has this funny business where we have to add something which we don't really know how to handle any better than we did before it seems like maybe this isn't very useful. Well now here's the key really sneaky observation.  Let's just look at a distance Matrix here. So I'm taking the determinant of Row 1 Row 2 Row 3.  grocery  Write the first repeater.  What happens if I swap the first and second rows of this Matrix?  Animatrix and I've got the first two rows are equal. What happened?  Is it this is a trick question and you know the answer what happens?  Should I write a specific example? I don't think it's going to help anymore. I think you all know the answer or just because you're not sure what I'm getting at because it seems like  if I give you two rows that are the same row and I asked you to swap them. What is the result?  Nothing happens if I swap those two rows.  R1 R1 R3  Nothing happened, but this property down here.  Tells me that if I swap those two rows.  How can I be I take the Matrix. I don't really change it. But because I can achieve this no change by. How can I possibly happen?  Do you know any numbers that are their own negative?  0  and that term is not there.  That's a really important property if you take the determinant if you see any Matrix has a receipt.  Okay, you can tell that immediately.  If you remember we're supposed to be a measure of whether a matrix is invertible.  Right, if a matrix has a repeated row or column that means that it doesn't have all of its rows or columns pivotal portable supposed to measure for us. Now. We see why that's true. It's because of this row swapping negation business. If you ever have a repeated row Echelon form if it's not invertible, then the determinant will be zero and now we see how the determinant behaves under all the row operations and it's easy to keep track of  There's no question.  Hey, so when I'm doing real operations.  All I have to do is keep track of it as a certain number associated each kind of row operation that start with the Matrix all the way to reduce trash one format in the process.  And if I just keep track.  Of what when I pivot I keep track of what I pivoted by.  if I roast I'd keep track of the fact that there was a roustabout * 20 - 1  And the main row operation where I take another I don't even need to keep track of those because that doesn't change the determinant or what this tells us is that at the end of the day if I want to compute the determinant if I just keep track of all those operations that it is going to be the product of all of those numbers at the end of time is the determinant of the reduced row Echelon form of the Matrix does a diagonal entries.  Now if the Matrix that you get at the end, we're just wrestling forum is reduced row Echelon form is not the identity. Matrix is not invertible. You're going to get a zero there and so we have proved this there.  Set if you say lyrics.  Either the Matrix was invertible, which just reminding you how different words fit together the same thing as saying that has full rank ranked end and pivots.  Then the product of the pivots X assign plus or minus the pivot. I had to X that the determinant of Matrix is just plus and minus the product of the pivots.  If the Matrix is invertible and if it's not invertible, then we get the serum which cell is the determinant does what it was supposed to determine the original.  Was not invertible.  So let's look at a specific example here for how we would implement this. So here's a couple zeros there, but I want to demonstrate these observations. We just made we're going to do is rub against this Matrix at least until  So the first row of right now I'm going to do is a roast well because I have a zero in the first century there. So I'm going to do a row swap.  between the first and second rows 1/2 - 1014 + 580  and when I do that, I'm just going to keep track of the fact.  But that role swap introduces a -1 into the determinant.  Now I'm going to do my favorite kind of operation.  Should I give me the desired 0 there I get 8-10 is -2 and 0 - -5 is this record that by noting a plus one there?  I know I need to do the same kind of row operation.  To get rid of the -2 in the 3-2 and then I'm going to multiply the second row by 2 and add to the Third.  so  that gives me  the desired zero there  Doesn't change the determinant Salon form so I could either continue and Go to reduced row Echelon form which will require me to Pivot next or I can remember from last day that now I know from the Kilpatrick.  Okay, and so this one has determinants.  1 * 1 * 13 or 13 and therefore keeping track of those things.  the determinant of the original Matrix  is  13 * 1 * 1 * -1 * -13  Okay, that wasn't much work at all. It was about the same exit even less work. The cofactor expansion would have been.  I would say it is important to do a hard stop because continuing any further will be wasting your effort. Once you have zero and below the main diagonal, you know, the determinant of that Matrix this leftover and you don't want to do the M squared over 2 more operations that required to get the registration form because none of those operations will change the determinant at 13 out and I keep track of that 13th, then all the remaining operations to Row 2 and ends replace road to with that, not to do them. I think it's a good idea for you guys to check using the cofactor expansion.  30 seconds or maybe a minute and you'll see that you get the same answer.  Okay, so that's really how determinants are computed. That's how Matlab calculate determinant form and then calculate X all the pivots and plus and minus one from Rose swaps together.  That means it only takes to remember the kind of the first three flops size of the Matrix that's to be compared to n factorial. But those numbers are just incomparable and factorial is ridiculously 3 already Enfield / 3 is 3 is 3 cubed / 3 or 9. So about 9 flops maximum compared to 3 factorial of 6.  Maybe it would have been faster in some cases. But let's do 4:40. / 3:40 is 64 / 3 is about 20. Whereas 4 factorial is 24 and 10 million. Okay. So if you're getting Beyond never ever use the cofactor expansion other than to prove properties of the determinants.  Computing determinants, you're always going to do it.  Okay.  No, I want to give a slightly different perspective on everything that we just did which is going to show us one more super important property of the determinant.  Okay, we've been doing row reduction from the very beginning of this class.  We've also been doing matrix multiplication since about the third week of this class. There's a connection between matrix multiplication believe it or not. And here's how we're talking about Square matrices achieved by multiplying by a certain Matrix. So what is an elementary Matrix? Well, it's just the results of a row operation on the identity Matrix.  Turn row operation on that won the first and third rows.  That means we get this.  Resulting Matrix on the right hand side there that is an example of an elementary Matrix.  How about if we do a Tibbetts right? So I'll start with the identity Matrix.  And let me replace.  The first row with the first row over 3.  There is another example of an elementary Matrix one where one and three on the diagonal has been changed from one to some other nonzero number and then the Third Kind of operation that usual Workhorse of row reduction. The one that gets used the most is why I take some multiple of the first so if I do that to the animatrix here  What that does is actually the opposite of what we want usually to do but that's okay. It does this.  Third example of these aren't the only kind of mattresses you can call Elementary operations. Once the very restricted class of matrices Elementary.  But we will see in a moment that every Matrix is a product of Elementary matrices. And the reason is one of these three common.  Now what if I take the operation and I do it to some other Matrix a production by one room freshener on the left by the corresponding Elementary Matrix.  Let's look at an example just to illustrate this point. Let's take a matrix a  1042 - 13111  the first step I would do here would be to multiply the first row by -2 and add to the second.  Replace the second row with that.  So let's do that.  So that gives me  multiplying the first row by -2 seconds in -8 - 5 there are four.  Well at the same time, let me take that Matrix.  1042 - 13111 and Multiplied on the left by the corresponding Elementary Matrix meaning I do that same rule operation by the first row by -2 1/10 to the identity Matrix.  Let's do that matrix multiplication.  Okay. Well, I have to multiply these things out and give 9 numbers here, but that's okay because a lot of them are very easy to compute. Let's look at the elements of the first row of the product a * first row of the Matrix here by the First Column, but that first row is 100. So I just take 1 * 1 + 0 for the 1st century is 1 * 0 + 1 * 4 + 0 which is just 1 0 0 then all the entries are going to be the same as the entry.  Similarly if I look at the bottom.  This bottom row here, I multiply 9001 times to call him. But all that's going to do is pick off the last entry write 0 + 0 + 100 + 1 this Elementary. It does not change the first or the second row as we know it.  When I look at the second the second row here, well there I'm multiplying by the row here comes the column and that means that I take - 2 * the entry in the first row in the second row Elementary operation was supposed to do implements. So I get - 2 + 2 * 1 - 2 * 0 + 1 * -1 + -2 * 4 + 3 which is -5 Czech.  Okay, that's just a demonstration. But actually we more or less prove that that's how that kind of Elementary row operation is implemented and you can follow through for the other kinds of operations as well.  Okay. So this is an interesting and useful observation operations are really implemented by multiplication.  Great. So what?  well  that tells us something great about matrices that have the identity of a matrix has one form that is to say invertible matrices.  So if I take an invertible Matrix, I know it's invertible. I figured that out somehow then that means it's reduced row Echelon form.  What's up with that really says that I'm going to be able to.  To some new Matrix A1 R22 some new Matrix R32 some new Matrix are for and that gives me the identity Matrix, which is the reduced row Echelon form if we have a bigger than 2 3 by 3 Matrix.  Each one of those row operations. We just saw corresponds to an elementary Matrix.  He won.  E2 E3 and E4 and so what that says here from the last slide, is it really this a one here that you get after one step of reduction is the same thing as E1 x a  No, we've got this a one-eyed we get to a to buy one step of raw Pro reductions is really easy two times a one.  But a one is equal to 1 times.  So that's really equal to 82 times.  Now, this is a 3 here. We got it from a to buy 1 steps is equal to 3 * 8.  but we just got an expression for ETA to its really  2 * 81 * a  but if we do this one more time.  we get that Pi is equal to 84 * 83 * 3 * 82 * 1 * a  Okay, so we get this equation here.  What is that actually say one more observation? We need to make that we've highlighted many times row operations are reversible.  Okay, any refreshing I do to get from The Matrix to a new Matrix? I can reverse it and go back and if I pivots and I'd have it by the reciprocal if I if I add three times the first row to the second then I'm going to add one negative one. Third of the first is reversible. If you look at the previous slide hear each one of those matrices is invertible.  Yeah, that's what it says to say that operation is reversible. Its corresponding Elementary. Matrix is invertible.  Well, it's one of those matrices is invertible. So it's take that equation we have the identity Matrix form is 84 * 83 * 2 * 81 *  so now let me multiply on the left by E4 * 83 * 82 * 1  Converse and that's going to equal a and remember that conversion reverses the order of multiplication so I get this  Guess what? That's our end result here.  Hey is equal to one inverse x 2 inverse X III inverse X?  Okay.  So let me summarize what it says if I get from a matrix to the identity Matrix operation, then in fact equal to the product of the elementary matrices inverse operation, which means exactly this operation.  So what that shows us? Is that every invertible Matrix?  Is a product of Elementary matrices?  Now what's so great about that?  Remember when we just a few minutes ago talked about how to actually compute determinants of the operations. Then you can determine how this is going to be the product of the plus and minus ones in the pivots.  Okay, but now we know that we can get all the way to the identity just by the product of matrices and what that tells us is the following remarkable theorem that will finish with today.  The determinants which is this super complicated cofactor expansion.  Function which is linear in the Rose individually, but not altogether and might be very complicated to compute from first blush operation also respect the algebraic structure of the matrices.  Okay, we talked about we talk about linear transformation that respect addition to terminate doesn't respect what we just saw so suppose that well, first of all, if if one of the two matrices A and B is not invertible, then their product can either either of those messages has zero determinant then so does the product so that is consistent invertible a is invertible. Then we can expand as a product of some Elementary matrices. Maybe it's three of them.  Edison Elementary matrices correspond to row operations maybe one of them was a pivot and one of them was a roll off that didn't require changing the terminal and one of them was a roast.  Is a product of only two row operations F1 and F2. One of them was a pivot and one of them was just a  What about a b?  E1 E2 E3 F1 F2  If I have a matrix, and I know what row operations are required to take it to the I to the identity and I have another AV to the identity. You just do the same row operations in sequence exactly what this says cuz the inverse of that thing is the identity.  I know that means that I just keep track of the same.  Row operations the same quantities for the operation. So the determinant of a appear was equal to x + 1 x - 1 is equal to 2 * 1 and here since these are row operations that take us to the identity is equal to x + 1 x - 1  the products of the determinant of a undetermined to be  Okay, so that's the deal every invertible. Matrix is a product of Elementary matrices and you already know how to find them. It's just row reduction.  What that means is it the determinant is a multiplicative function. And so let me just conclude by noting for example, if I want to take the determinant of a matrix to the 100th power, which is something you're asked to do on your Matlab homework. One thing you could do here is take this Matrix. Maybe it's five by five and X South a hundred times. You have to do it a hundred times if it's 525 Ops is 12500. It's a lot of competition but instead we get that this is the same thing as the determinant of a to the 100th power.  All right. So on Friday, we will finish our conversation about what the determinant actually is and "
