    "Full Transcript": "Friday everyone for the last time  this week  This is our final lecture of math 18 and it is a review lecture for the final exam, which is tomorrow. There's am as tomorrow if you are registered in lectures a b and c anyway,  Starting at 11:30 and a three rooms around campus your room and seat assignments are posted in your Triton Ed is a link in the big announcement about the final at the top of the course webpage about how to interpret what it says there if it isn't clear make sure you get there on time if that's make sure you get there 15 minutes early.  If you need a left-handed desk somewhere, you've already emailed me. If you need a left-handed desk. We've left them all empty coming down to the front and see the exam leader. So the media Professor Eggers or one of the room you're in and ask for it to be switched to a left-handed desk. Okay. This is the same algorithm. You've gone through in the two midterms. It's going to be no difference just as this is a longer exam the exam has  50 points on it as compared to the 30 on the midterms. So it is 5/3 as long as the midterms. I expect you to be able to comfortably finish it in well under 2 hours. That doesn't mean if you're taking longer than that, you're not doing. Well everyone works at a different pace. It just means that I really hope that it's designed and planned it so that it will not be a time pressure situation. Okay. I want you to show that you understand the material and as long as you do we're all going to be happy.  Exam is cumulative. It covers everything that we've done from day one in this course until the end but it focuses on the stuff that we didn't hear the end. Okay, so more than half of the exam is about stuff that was done in the last two and a half weeks. So my plan for right now is to go through some of the questions from the to practice midterm practice exams that I posted and I will start by going through questions relating to material that we've done since midterm to on eigenvalues and eigenvectors orthogonal projections that sort of thing one quick reminder my last please hear you. Please fill in your case that actually also created a survey that I posted. I sent an email to all of you as well with some additional feedback that I'd like to get from you that aren't covered by the cable. Please take a few minutes and fill those out we really can do well with the feedback. We really can find out what it thinks what you think you did we did. Well what you think we can improve for next time so that  Your successors will have an even better time in this course. So right now response rates for The Capes are hovering around 40% I'd love to see that go up to 80% you have until 11:59 p.m. Tonight in order to do that.  So without further Ado, I'd like to get started on working through some problems. If you have questions, please bring them forward while we're working. Now the first problem I'd like to work there was actually one that is not on the practice final exam. The practice final exam is didn't include many questions of this form, but I want to do a question of this form. Okay. This is a question that is similar to one that you had on midterms. There will be a question of this form on tomorrow's final exam. This is the most abstractly challenging Concept in the course, I think.  And it's something that you all needs to show that you've worked hard to understand which is what is a Subspace cuz that's really the same for the whole course everything we've done in one way or another relates to subspaces. So we need to have a good rock solid understanding of what is a Subspace and how to recognize one how to recognize when you're not in a Subspace. Okay. So here is the question. This is not one. That would be you seen before but it was it is similar to one that was on midterm to the following examples of vector space V is given together with a subset s determine whether ass is a Subspace or not in each case explain why it is or is not a Subspace.  The first example is the vector space of 2 by 3 matrices and a is some fixed 4 by 3 Matrix.  And we describe a subset of the set of 2 by 3 matrices matrices that satisfy a x x transpose equal zero. Is that a Subspace or not? When you see that question presented to you, you have to immediately remember look I know the definition of Subspace for I look on my two pages of notes that I'm allowed to bring for the definition of Subspace and I look sad are just three conditions. I need to check.  I need to check does this set s contain the zero vector be careful the zero Vector looks different depending which Vector space. So does zero Vector is the 2 by 3 Matrix with all zeros in it?  Is the zero Vector in there?  Is the set s closed under addition so if I take two sings X1 and x2 in that subset at and add them up is the sum of those two things also in next to say also in s and the third condition is it closed under scalar multiplication if I take an X in that set us and I think a real number Alpha and I'm up by alpha x axis that new thing alpha x x also in the set S. I need to check those three things if any one of them fails for any example, then it's not a Subspace if it's always holds for every sample space then it is a Subspace. So let's look at this example here. Okay, so that's what I need to decide for myself if it's going to work or not before I start barreling in blinds.  So let's let's look at this example for a moment. So what I'm doing here, there's a condition. Okay, here is a condition that's telling you whether access in the center not the condition is a x x transpose.  Does that look like a linear condition?  Yes, or no. What do you think?  Well, let's think about the kinds of subspaces. We know how about the very first Subspace that we ever looked at with regard to matrices. So no space of a matrix the null-space of a matrix a now this is nothing else paid today, but it looks kind of like that because the null-space of the Matrix a is a set of vectors x times x equals 0 and we know that we can prove that from the three conditions. So, let's see if we can use the same approach here to see the fist is a Subspace and the key is that this condition is out of linear things.  A x a x a matrix matrix multiplication is linear. I'm taking the transpose of a matrix transpose is a linear transformation of matrices. So let's check our three conditions.  Is 0 in s. Well, what's a * 0 Purp?  0 purpose and not proper size 0 transpose 0 transpose is 0 of the appropriate size. And what's 8 * 0 what happens if you multiply Matrix X the zero Matrix hero?  Yes, a x 0 / 0 transpose is 0 so therefore x equals 0 is in S2.  If I take two things X1 and x2 in s is there some X1 + X2.  Well, I just have to check the condition. I take a x X1 + X2 transpose and see if that thing is 0 and now I start using the linearity of everything involved here. This is a x alright, the transpose of a song is the sum of the transposes. That's what it means to say that transposes linear is the sum of 8 times those matrices. So that's a X1 transpose + ax to transpose.  now  X1 and X2 are in s  That means exactly that x 1 and x 1 is an s that means that this thing is equal to 0 x 2 isn't asked me is that this thing is equal to 0. So, this is 0 + 0 + x 1 + X2 is a matrix with the property that a times its transpose is 0  and the third condition is scalar multiplication.  If Alpha is a scalar and X is a nest is Alpha * X and S. We just plug and chug.  We take a x alpha x transpose and see if that is 0.  so we use the fact now that  transpose is a linear operation on matrices. So this is a x alpha x transpose.  A x a real number x a matrix we can take that out the house front.  Cuz matrix multiplication is linear.  I know I have something X ax transpose remember ex is in s which exactly means that a x x transpose is equal to 0. So this is equal to zero. This is equal to Alpha X or which is Daryl. All three conditions are satisfied there for S is a Subspace.  Okay.  Alright next example here is the vector space friendly warm-and-fuzzy Vector space R3.  And here is a subset of it is a set of vectors in R3 of this particular form factors that look like 3 x + 2 T in the first component is 2T in the 2nd ST in the third component to free variables and stuff to make with whatever I want. I got all the actors in that substitute. Is that a Subspace or not? What do you think? I'm just looking at it how many people say it is a Subspace?  Hands high if you just say yes appreciable fractional you how many people think it's not a Subspace.  Okay, how many people didn't vote?  All right, how many people have no idea?  Okay. Thank you for your honesty.  so let's think about this from okay we could  Try to do the same thing. That's always an option. We can say hey, let's let's just start verifying the three properties. Let's look at the first one is the zero Vector in there. Can I get the zero vector by choosing absentee appropriately? Yes, how both equal to 0 0 + 0 0 - 0 and now I can start taking too much ones in adding The Muppet Show me a lot of writing.  Or I can recognize this as in a form that we seen many examples in this class.  Do the trick that I do every single time. I do row reduction and try to find a parametric solution for the that system of equations instead of factor out the s  factor out the tea.  And say hey look s is equal to the set of vectors of this Farm.  is the set of vectors of the form some arbitrary scalar muscle that Vector 210 plus some arbitrary melts kill a mouse with a vector 3 - 2 - 1  It's a set of linear combinations of those two vectors. We have a name for that. It is the span. This is just another way of writing the span of the vectors 210 + 3 - 2 - 1 and now you can say as we've discussed in class many times.  Any span of some vectors?  Is a Subspace?  So yes, that is a Subspace in this example.  Okay moving on.  Another warm and fuzzy example of vector space to be as the plane R2 is a set of vectors XY bisects of x + y is no smaller than -1 and no bigger than plus one.  No, it is possible to draw what this looks like. Okay, we can think of it geometrically that might help us here.  So let's do that.  So here's the plane and recession example, what what I would do is say hey look the boundary of this region. The set of vectors is given by when I get equals x there. So the set of vectors for which X Plus y equals one.  What does that look like? Well the line X Plus y equals one. If you think back to your high school algebra class or Sabina y equals 1 - x it looks like that.  And the line X Plus y equals minus one is down here.  Approximately and the region in question is everything inside here.  Okay.  So that's the set of vectors geometrically in there. And so let's look at that. Does it satisfy? All the conditions of being a Subspace is the zero Vector in there?  Yeah, and we can see that from here is 0 0 8 does satisfy 0 + 0 is between -1 and 1 is that set closed under scalar multiplication?  Know what's an example of a vector in there that is not closed under skin of multiplication is not to remain in the space the set understand multiplication.  great, perfect if I take  the vector  01 which is in there. It just touches the edge the vector zero.  One it does satisfy 0 + 1 is between -1 and 1. Yes, but if I take that back there and forgive me, I'm going to steal it by 2 instead of a thousand thousand will work even better. Take care of the vector.  02  and that is not in there.  It is not the one you cannot scale vectors in this set and have them stay in the set. So this is not a Subspace.  Is not closed.  under scalar multiplication  great. Okay, and one more our favorite examples extra space of polynomials, right? Everybody's favorite, right?  Polynomials of degree at most 4 we know that that's a vector space and here is the subset. It's the set of polynomials pee in their forehead polynomials for which if I add up. - 1  repeat 1 in subtract twice P0 I get 2018.  Okay. What do you think? What's your intuition tell you before we start plugging away. Is it a Subspace or not?  Okay. Well if we don't have any intuition about it, then we should probably just start going through the list.  The list says we have to check.  Is 0 in s know what is zero in this example is MP4. What is the zero Vector in the space in a space of polynomials?  It is the zero polynomial zrt is identical e-0e if the polynomial it is identical zero satisfies this condition. So let's just compute 0 - 1 - 2 * 800  plus the other one is going to be in the subsets us that has to equal 2018.  What does that equal?  Yeah, this is 0 - 2 * 0 + 020 which is not in my book sequel to 2018.  So the answer here is no and therefore s is not a Subspace.  Okay.  So there were four examples of checking whether something is a Subspace or not.  When all else fails and actually probably most of the time just from the start you should just try to go through the list and check to see does it satisfy all the three conditions that Define a Subspace.  But sometimes you can recognize the thing as already in the form that we know is a Subspace like if it is the status on vectors or if you can recognize it as the column space of a matrix directors or the null-space of some Matrix or the orthogonal complement of some Subspace or or or or look through your nose looks through the lectures there lots of spit kind of subspaces. We started if you can immediately recognized as one of those then you don't even have to check.  guess  right to the question is so we just have to check that zeros in there and then states that at this painting set and that's enough answer is yes, and also it's too much because just saying that this is identified as the span of vectors already told you that the zero Vector is included the span of any collection of vectors includes the zero Vector because you can always take all of the coefficients to be zero.  okay, so it's good enough in this example to say it is a Subspace because it is  okay. Now I would like to move on to do some of the practice problems from the finalists the practice final exams.  I'm going to skip towards the end just at the beginning. I'm going to go to start with this one.  I want to discuss problems that involve things that we did near the end of the course. This one doesn't part C.  So here's a standard question. It was on something like this was on midterm 2 it's on both practice finals. You can guess that something like this is going to be on your final exam tomorrow.  The question is here is a matrix a a big Matrix. This one is 5 by 4 and you are told what the reduced row Echelon form is already. You don't need to do row reduction. It's already done for you. Be careful.  And how you use that information and you're asked to find a basis for the column space of a in part a no call him space with a lots of bases for it. But the canonical one that we choose is it's a basis consists of the pivotal Columns of a to figure out which Columns of a are pivotal, you know that those are the same index columns as the pivotal columns in the reduced row Echelon form of a  So, let's see, which ones does there's a pivotal one in that column.  Is a pivotal one in that column is a pivotal one in that column, but there is no pivotal one in the lot to the first three columns of this Matrix are pivotal and therefore the first three columns of the original Matrix. They're so cure a basis is the pivotal Columns of a  form a basis  call Taste of Asia. And so the basis is those three calls to 1 - 1 1 1 3 2 - 1 1 1.  and 55012  great find a basis for the null space of a is Part B. Okay. Now what we're looking for is the non pivotal Columns of the reduced row Echelon form of a but that doesn't mean that those form a basis just tell us how to construct the bases. So this one  corresponds to a free variable  At what? I always do in this in examples like this one. I always  just  go through the math and say okay. Here's what I do this. The null-space of a is the set of vectors and is going to be an X in R4 because there's four columns. It's the set of vectors of this form.  Well that reduced row Echelon form.  That tells me that x 1 is equal to -9x for the second equation says x 2 is equal to 15 x 4 that third equation says X is equal to -7 x 4 and X words are free variable and that's all the information present. So this is  x 4 x - 9 15 - 7 1  and so this one vector here.  Is a basis.  for the null space today  and then finally in part C whereas to find a basis for the orthogonal complement of the null-space of a  now what that means literally is we calculate the set of all vectors X in R4 that are perpendicular to every Vector in the null-space of a perpendicular to every Vector that is a scalar multiple of that. What now? We could write down equations to tell us what that is and figure out what that thing is or we can remember the serum that the orthogonal complement of the null-space of a is the row space of a  Now the row space of a which is also.  Up to rotation transpose equal to the column space of a transpose.  Okay, the column space of a transpose if you wanted to interpret it literally like that. All you have to do is take a transpose and find the reduced row Echelon form of a transpose to find which call transposer pivotal. I choose those columns.  You don't want to do that extra work. And so instead we have a serum that says hey the row space actually is invariant under row operations Aerospace doesn't change my gyro operations. So instead of Roseanne a I can shoot some rows in a trance post and it in the Rose wrestling form of that and the benefit of that is easy to tell which rows of a are pivotal of the reduced row Echelon form as a are pivotal. They're just the top once by definition the nonzero once those are all pivotal.  We don't know which rose in a corresponding to those ones because in getting from eggs with reduced row Echelon form using row operations. We may have needed to do some row swaps.  Okay, in fact, this was such an example I think but I actually don't remember and it doesn't matter because we shouldn't even bother checking we shouldn't try to use the withrow's some roses.  Some collection of three rows in a will form a basis, but it's hard to tell which ones but since the row spaces and ran under row operations. Let's just use those three rows in the reduced row Echelon form of a okay a bassist.  Can be taken.  as the pivotal Rose  in the reduced row Echelon form of a  And I'm not going to bother writing that down here. I'm just going to write an arrow pointing to it. Okay, the orange ones.  I think you should write it down on the exam, but I'd like to move on to other problems, but we still have time.  Okay, so there is a typical kind of question is testing the basics from earlier in the course together with your knowledge of orthogonal complements and how they work for it to Classic subspaces for a matrix. Yes.  Yes.  So the question is should be written as grows or his columns. The answer is yes, because your textbook is kind of loose about that. So if you really identify the transpose you should really be turning those three orange rose on their side and making them columns. But I like to think of the row space as the linear combinations of the only thing you should not do is without justification use some rose from a or Collins my transpose if you want to go through some work and Ro reduce a transpose and tell me which ones of those are those. Okay fine. I think it's probably waste of your time. But if you just stay I'm going to take the first three rows of a  First of all, that might be wrong, but even if it's right, even if it turned out that those are the pivotal Rose if you state that you will definitely lose once that you just use the rose petal Rose in the reduced row Echelon form for the row space operations. Yes question.  I'm not sure what it means to have. The answers can be if it wasn't equal to the column space of a transpose cuz that is what it sequel to If you so I would prefer to ride it as the transpose of the column space of a transpose where you rotate them back to be rose again, but I just words being I will be easy about that. You can write them as rows rows columns. I don't care.  Okay, let's move on. What's the okay, let's let's work some of this problem. This is  So here are three vectors you want you to answer you 3 1/4 Factor V in R3.  Show that is an orthogonal basis for R3 and then compute the lengths of us actors.  Okay.  So one word there makes it very easy is very easy to check to show that they are orthogonal vectors means I need to show that they are mutually orthogonal every pair of vectors in that list of three is orthogonal. All I need to do is compute three. Products you one. You too is 1 * 2 + 1 * -2 + 0 * 1 which is 2 - 2 + 0 which is  You won. You three?  Is equal to 1 * -1 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 4 which is 1 - 1 + 0 which is 0 and you two. You three.  Is equal to 2 * -1 + -2 * 1 + 1 * 4 which is -2 - 2 + 4 which is zero. All three of those vectors are orthogonal to each other so they are orthogonal vectors.  Do they form a basis for R3?  Well remember that if I have orthogonal vectors, they are automatically linearly independent.  Unless one of them is the zero vector or any of these the zero vector.  Therefore we have three orthogonal nonzero vectors.  And therefore we have three linearly independent.  letters  In our three and therefore they form a basis.  Any three linearly dependent vectors in R3 to R3? The last thing we have to do is just calculate the likes. So the length of you one is the square root. So take the square of the square of 1 squared + 1 squared witches to there for that length is  the length of U2 squared is 2 squared plus  -2 squared  + 1 squared which is 9 left for the length of you two is 3 and the length of use 3 squared is 2 squared + 3 squared + 1 squared which is 4 + 9 + 1 which is 14. So the length of you three is Route 14.  Oh, that's a v. Okay good.  Thank you.  We're not asked to calculate the length of be so one more time here the length of use 3 squared - 1 squared + 1 squared + 4 squared which is 1 + 1 + 16 which is 18. So therefore it the length of you three is the root of 18, which I would prefer to ride is 2 * 9 3 times the root of 2. So you three is three times the length of you want.  Okay, why are we calculating those weather actually going to be useful in Part B hear heartbeat has find the coordinates of the vector v in terms of this basis be that we found so visible in the first part. Okay. Now one way we could do this problem is to go back to the way we talked about it at the beginning. So what do coordinates mean? So this means the V is the is the vector the coordinate Vector in R3?  Where the vector v can be expanded uniquely as x 21 + X2 YouTube + X3 you three?  Vector equation you could do that by.  Row reduction, which is correct. That's absolutely a perfectly fine way to do this problem, but it's not the fastest way to basis as you saw in part a  okay, because  is orthogonal is an orthogonal basis we get for free.  Any Vector in R 3 is equal to its orthogonal projection into the span of the vectors you want you too and you three because they stand every Vector but that orthogonal projection has a nice formula. It's V. You 1/2 length of you 1 squared times. You want + VW 2 / the length of you two squared times you two plus v. Use 3/4 length of you three squared times you three.  So we just plug in all those numbers we calculated in the first part. Okay. Oh, well actually know we didn't calculate the. Products in the first part. So we need to calculate those three. Products you one dotted with v is equal to 1 * 2 + 1 * 3 + 0 which is 5 U2. V is equal to 2 * 2 + -2 * 3 + 1 * 1 + 4 - 6 + 1 which is -1 and you three. V is equal to -2 + 3 + 4 which is 7 - 2 or 5 and so the first one there is 5 / the length of you 1 squared which is 2 * 1  110 + V1. U2 is minus.  1 / the length of you two squared which is 9 * U2 - 1 1/4  That's right. That was you three. I just rode in their copying errors are common.  Plus you three. V is 5 / length of you three squared which is 18 tons of extra - 1 1/4 stop there.  Heck if this question is asked of you on the on the final exam don't spend any time working out the arithmetic and giving a closed Vector there it's easier for us to great that then whatever you come up with from there that may or may not have numerical errors in it. There may have been getting to this point. But if we see that you wrote down that we can track those errors and take off the appropriate small number of points for them instead of not being sure where you messed up if you made a mistake, yes.  No, it's not a normalize vector and nobody asked for normalize Vector. We used the formula care that has the length of the use already in it. But you have to use when you have an orthogonal basis if it was an orthonormal basis if we had normalize the vectors in the first part, we wouldn't have to divide through by the UN squared you to squirt etcetera. Yes.  Write good point. If you did this, you wouldn't get full points. I didn't get those points. There are X1 X2 and X3.  Right, cuz that's what we're looking for. We're looking for something times you want for something times YouTube for something times you three. So we get that the coordinates of v in the B bases are 5/2 - 1/9 + 5/18  Brakes are definitely don't combine those.  Okay.  Okay. Now in part C. We are asked to compute the orthogonal projection of V onto the Subspace spanned by the vectors you to any of three?  And you know what? We just stopped halfway through the calculation from above instead and say oh no projection onto the span of U1 and U2.  Of the that is equal to because they're orthogonal. We're allowed to do this. It's V. You want / the length of you 1 squared times you want?  Bus V. You to write it was supposed to be you two and you three. So let's read carefully.  cast of you to hear  And you three here?  but that just means that we're taking  only the second two terms over here.  Which means that we're taking only the second to terms over here. So that's equal to - 1/9 2 - 2 1 + 5/18 - 114 stop there.  last day of Saginaw projection onto the span of you two and you three  Alright great.  Next problem, you know, I'm going to skip this problem for now. We only have 14 minutes left and I want to get to an eigenvector eigenvalue problem. This is gram Schmidt problem. And it's going to be similar to the last example, except we have to actually orthogonalize the vectors already. If you look on Piazza a student posted a beautiful long description taking you through a gram Schmidt example, I have my lectures from last two days posted that you can watch as well. So I think because of the time constraints will skip the gram Schmidt problem for now.  And here is an eigenvalue problem.  Here's a matrix AI 3 by 3 Matrix.  Is there a question?  Here's a question. That's answer it.  Here's a matrix a you're asking for a to find all the eigenvalues and identify from your calculation. What are their algebraic multiplicity? What does that mean? How do we find out? How does Matlab find eigenvalues that's the QR decomposition as we discussed yesterday. But how do you find eigenvalues with a determinant you calculate the characteristic polynomial characteristic polynomial of a is the determinant of a minus lamp two times the identity Matrix.  determinant of the Matrix aftertaste subtract Lambda from the diagonal entries  I know I have my choice of how to calculate to determine I could do it by row reduction in keeping track of the pivots or I could use the cofactor expansion someone on Piazza. I hey, I learned this great trip from Khan Academy videos for calculate 3 by 3 determinant. Can I use the answer is as long as you include a proof. That is correct.  I don't want a disc on Academy if that's a resource that is helpful to you guys, please use it use all resources that are out there as long as you're sure that they are correct and I think Khan Academy is great actually, but just because there are some tricks over there doesn't mean they teach you to understand why they work there is a kind of formula for a 3 by 3 determinant as we discussed. I don't actually think it's simpler is actually harder than doing the cofactor expansion we're going to do and we're going to choose the third row to expand along cuz it's mostly zeros there. So this is just going to be remember our plus minus pattern.  That's a plus. So this just becomes 2 - lamb. X the determinant of the two by two thing excluding that row and column which is 2 - 11 0 1 1 - Lanka and all that to buy to determine that is pretty easy to compute. It's just 2 - Lambda * 1 - 5 - 0 * 1  0 * 1 is zero. So I really just get two- Lambda * 2 - Lambda * 1 - Lambda.  therefore the eigenvalues  are 1 and 2 are the roots of that pawn on the zeros of that polynomial which is already factored for you and  What are their algebraic multiplicities?  Well, that's the powers.  That's the powers that you see.  up here  One has algebraic multiplicity 1 and 2 has algebraic multiplicity 2.  Now that doesn't mean that the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue Lambda is equal to Lambda that just happened to work out in this evening.  Give a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to each of the eigenvalues of a so that means we need to know spaces in space.  for 2  let's do for one first. That's the null-space of a -1 times the identity Matrix. So that's the null-space of subtract 1 from diagonal entries 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1  So I need to find a basis for that. No space. How do I do that? How do I find a basis for a null space?  Row reduction. So let's I'm going to subtract the first row from the second for the result in the second row. It gives me the zero there is zero there in a -1 there.  Okay, I'm almost done.  I'm going to  Hibbett that one  you shouldn't do what I just did on the exam. You should write the next step so I know what you're doing, but I want to save time so we can get some more questions. And now I'm going to subtract that second row from the third row, but the result in the third row.  And that Matrix is introduced. I was almost in reduced row Echelon form one more step. I'm now going to subtract the second row from the first row, and I guess this  So that's the reduced row Echelon form of a and therefore I can write this. This is the set of vectors of the form x 1 x 2 x 3 is equal to okay. I see that the second column is not evident. That means a text to is a free variable. The first equation says x 1 is 0 the second equation says X 2 X 3 0  X 2 x the vector 010 of the null space dog in space here is the span of that one vector so that one vector is a basis for that null space.  diverticular the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 is 1  that's always going to happen when the algebraic multiplicity was one.  Crazy geometric multiplicity can't be bigger than the algebraic multiplicity. It could be smaller. But if it's one, it can't be smaller because we know the thing actually is an eigenvalue. So it actually does have some eigenvector.  The geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the no face of a - land up by the dimension of the eigenspace now. How about the eigenspace?  Of the eigenvalue to so that's the null-space of a -2 times the identity. So that's the null-space of well, I have to subtract 2 from the diagonal entries now.  And hey that Matrix is already almost in reduced row Echelon form.  All I have to do is swap the first and the second Rose.  And pivot to get a plus one there.  I did. I'm sorry. So actually there's a little more reduction work that needs to be done here. Okay. Sorry about that.  I would have not got some points on this problem.  Okay, so I still should do what I did and swap the first and second rows.  Actually, that's better because it's already in reduced row Echelon form now, right? So now then I'll space to find a basis of this.  It's a set of vectors with 1 x 1 x 2 x 3.  Where the first equation says well now it's going to be X2 this a free variable first. I quit or just like before actually the first equation says x 1 is equal to x 2 and the third question says x 3 is equal to 0 so this is vectors of the form some multiple of 110 and therefore that two bases.  for the small space  we found bases for the all the icon spaces is a diagonalizable.  No.  No.  the geometric Multiplicity  eigenvalue to is one we get that from here.  but the algebraic Multiplicity  Is 2 bigger than 1 therefore, there are not enough eigenvectors.  to form a basis  and therefore a is not diagonalizable.  Great.  That was problem 7 so let's see what problem 8 is maybe we'll have time to do that. One more problem. Yeah, let's do this one.  One more eigenvector eigenvalue problem.  here's a matrix a  3 by 3 Matrix again  explain how you can tell that a is diagonalizable without calculating any eigenvectors are eigenvalues.  What could you possibly do weight was talking about how for a generic matrix? It's a very difficult to tell just by looking at it weather stag mod simple question.  Answer, what's your answer?  Great a transpose equals a of the symmetric Matrix. So what?  Sorry what?  Yes, so State the theorem the theorem is that every symmetric Matrix is diagonalizable. And that's how we can tell it's probably a good idea. If you see a question like that to answer using the name of that which is  the spectral theorem. It's only throw in the whole quarter that we gave without forgiveness other ones like the ranks are on. So maybe it's not the only one but now if you just say what you just said this make her sister metric and there's a fear of that every symmetric Matrix is diagonalizable. You'll get full points, but it's good for your for your mental health to remember the name of this of this therapy equals a transpose there for by the spectral theorem.  Hey is in fact orthogonally?  diagonalizable  Okay, great.  We're actually given some eigenvectors and eigenvalues for this Matrix till you and we are told or we are told are eigenvectors with eigenvalues minus one for you and two for the compute the inner product to the power of 2017.  I am not going to sit around and take 2017 top powers of that Matrix how we going to do this? We are told.  8 * 0 is equal to -1 times you it's an eigenvector there for following ideas that you use on your Matlab homework. For example a squared x you is -1 squared x you  And a to the 2017 is equal to -1 to the 2017 times you had a few again. So this is just the inner product of negative u and v  Yeah, I can do that calculation very easily but I don't even need to because you and V. So this is negative the inner product of you with v and u and v are eigenvectors.  of a symmetric Matrix  with distinct eigenvalues  I thought you was an eigenvector, but I guess value -1 vs. 9mm value to and therefore.  They are orthogonal that's part of the spectral theorem of calculus. We did last date so I can start immediately 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 x - 2 is 2 - 2 which is Sarah.  Okay.  so part 3 asks us to compute the vector v + 8 of the 2017 you but we let's just give away after we depart because that's equal to V was the vector 1 1 -2 1/8 of the 2017 year was the same as - you so that's just one 1 - 2 - 1 1 1 which is 0 0 - 3  Okay.  If you wanted to see other problems from the other sample final exam watch the podcast from the 12 cholesterol problems from the other one in the 12 p.m. For the day, and I will see you all bright and early at 11:30 tomorrow morning. Have a nice weekend. "
