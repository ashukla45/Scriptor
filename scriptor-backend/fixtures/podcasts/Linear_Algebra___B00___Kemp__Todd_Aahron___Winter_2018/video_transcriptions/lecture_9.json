I think you're going to find what we start with today a lot more concrete than the last couple of lectures. Although we're quickly going to connect it with everything that we've already done, of course and then to be clear what we're doing in today's lecture will not be covered on Wednesday nights midterm same but it will be on the next midterm on the final exam and all the homework. So it's important on Wednesday. Your midterm is in the evening and those three lecture halls in revelle college. You should make sure you know, which one you're in and which seat number you're in in that room by looking on your right nut during the lecture on Wednesday in this room at 10 a.m. We will do a review session for that midterm if that's what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through some of the problems from those two sample midterms to work them together, but that won't take the whole lecture. So please bring your questions. If you have any questions content questions problems you and I work from the textbook and Sing like that, go ahead and bring them in will be soliciting from the audience and we'll work some problems together answer some questions together. That's the plan for Wednesday quick reminder that you have a MyMathLab homework set do tonight at 11:59 p.m.  Okay, and again the the midterm as well just mention it covers everything we've done up to but not including this lecture which means everything in chapter one except for Section 1.6 their practice midterms posted and please check your seating assignment.  So let's get started with today's lecture material moving on to section 2.1 Matrix operations. Now we have now since the very beginning actually been working with matrices matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers it sometimes square and rectangular either wide or tall.  And they've had a number of different interpretations at the beginning. They came off as a simplified way of writing down a system of linear equations. We would remove all of the equal signs and write down the augmented Matrix associated with that system. And then do these automated row operations on it in order to send me like what we'll be doing to the equations to to save time.  But we also singled out part of that is the coefficient Matrix and we've been talking about all sorts of characterizations of things to do with vectors and equations that are properties of matrices and sometimes those properties depend on the interpretation of the Matrix whether it's an augmented Matrix Oracle efficient Matrix, for example, but that's all about the interpretation. But the actual operations are the same and now we're going to be thinking of matrices in a potentially new way right now though. We'll see that we've already seen it and it's probably different guys in the last two lectures. Now, we're going to think of matrices as vectors know what do I mean by that? Well, as I said are definition of what is a vector  Vectors are well. I said that they were just list of numbers. But what made them vectors is the fact that you can add them and skill a x  And that's the crucial thing here because now we're going to soften the first statement vectors don't need to be list of numbers. I'm going to let a matrix be a vector The crucial thing is that I can add and scalar multiply matrices just the same way as vectors. So let's start with Edition. So here are three matrices their sizes are different. There are 2 X 3 and C is the Reversed 3 by 2. We're going to treat a and b as if they lived in some RN space think we're going to treat them like vectors in terms of doing linear operations on them. I can scale a matrix and I can add or subtract matrices. I can take linear combinations of matrices of the same size and the way I do it is just to add and scalar multiply each  Entries appropriately experimenter is appropriately so that is to say just like with Colin if I'm going to add up.  Matrices then I add the like coefficients.  Okay, so I'll write those ones. I won't keep trying more colors. So I I compared the light coefficients to put them together. So for example, he was a linear combination of the two matrices. 2A - B is a + b 2 a - be so how do I do this? Well, the first thing I do is I multiply The Matrix a by 2.  So let's do it in two steps just to make it really clear. So if I multiply The Matrix a by 2 then just like with a vector that means that I scale all of the entries by 2. So I gives me 2 - 214  6 4 and 2 and I'm going to subtract from that the Matrix be  and now the way that I do that color coded there is to just add or subtract whatever operation I'm going to do to the like coefficients. Okay, the 11 entries I'll subtract 1 to enter off of truck that was and so on. So the first entry over here is 2 - 0 inches to get - 2 - 2 - 414 - 1 + 13/6 - 44 - 2 is 2 + 2 - 8 is -6  Okay, so that's how I do linear operations. That's how I take linear combinations of matrices. I forget the fact that they aren't cullum's there now a raise but I treat them just like I do with the columns doing those on your operations on them.  okay right now let me go one more stuff here and say oh, well, you know now we would do our row operations on this end so well, so let's see would probably yeah, but probably pivot the first one, although maybe we want to swap the first but  And so on right? That's what we do next, right?  Should tell by the tone in my voice that the answer is no that is not what we do next. There is no next. Damn. This is really important. It's a common mistake to make the first time that you're staying Matrix operations. We've been doing row reduction for a long time. Now, in fact that I lied, it's not it's the answer most questions in this class. Are you shouldn't automatically sync Road auction every time you see Matrix if I'm doing these operations operation and they're not right to do that equal sign their make sense is the definition of how I know it's true.  Vector operations with matrices, you're not doing real operations. Guess it don't mix the two outro operations or something that you do. Once you have interpreted to Matrix in a certain way as the coefficient Matrix or augmented Matrix system of equations, for example, and then the operations will help you answer questions about that system or if you want to answer questions about the columns like are they linearly independent or do they spend all of our might we know that all well as I do central operations? I will help me answer those questions, but it doesn't mean that you should be okay. So let's see what we can do next. So what have we learned here? So let's do a different sound for. How about how do I how do I compute that?  shaking your head  why?  Exactly. They're not the same size. You cannot add them. So this is not defined.  You can only add matrices of the same exact size or whatever that you can't add two different sizes of different sizes. The two kinds of Matrix operations scalar multiplication and addition just like four vectors.  These operations is operations behave for matrices exactly the same way they do for vectors. They have all the same kind of properties that you expect. They do from vector addition and multiplication and in particular from real addition and scalar multiplication. So if I add two matrices up, it doesn't matter what order I do the addition in and it's similarly if I had it doesn't matter what order I bracket them and I could first add a and b and then had or I could first add VNC again. All of this has conditioned on the matrices all being the same size but is not operational make sense.  As with vectors and with real numbers, there is an additive identity element zero four vectors. It's the zero Vector the vector with all zeros in the column and for matrices, it's the Matrix of the appropriate size with all 0 entries Matrix than the zero that you can use in this morning the seven by 800.  And that means riding zero to every component but that doesn't change any component. So adding zeros does nothing. It's the additive identity.  So that's operates the nice properties of addition for matrices multiplication and how it makes as in with Edition. So that's the same thing as just multiplying our times ass and using that to scale The Matrix a associative multiplication log scalar multiplication law and also most points given up location just reviews over addition both ways. So I could take two matrices. I can come up and then scale them or alternatively I could scale each of the matrices.  And then add afterward and those give me the same result.  At same time I could.  Steelers up or I could use each of the real numbers have that vectors over scale over film application have and it works exactly the same way for Matrix operations. Okay, so you don't have to memorize these things. It's just that you keep in mind that when you doing these operations they behave the way you would expect but I I just want to put it in and hear a warning.  It's to Honest-1 all only when the sizes match.  Okay, if a and b have different sizes than an RC has different size than none of this makes sense. So all of this only makes sense when they have the same size and two.  beware  Not every property.  from real algebra  That's algebra real numbers works for matrices.  That... Means we're going to see in a few minutes. So I'm the daughter wanted everything here does but you shouldn't take that as an example to say everything works the way I would expect. We'll see him in a moment.  Okay.  so  let's look at it. I think this is the same examples we saw before but now I want to talk about their interpretation. So I'm just giving you a new algebra. Will you can all do it. Now? How do I add and multiply matrices can do it easily and you shouldn't be expected to do it over and over. You're not a computer.  I just had matrices of come up in different interpretations so far. If a matrix is the Matrix of a linear system of equations Matrix in that context. Usually what we do in order to answer questions about the system operations. Then adding those two together with equations from the two different systems add matrices together and the answer is that it comes from  What we understood matrices as in the last two lectures.  Matrices can give us a new class of functions called linear transformations.  Linear Transformations, which we also call a matrix Transformations are functions of the Form and Function TT of a vector X is equal to a x x we saw that that was a linear transformation its preserves additional vacation. That's an equivalence relations. So here are two matrices and we could think of them as the standard matrices of two linear Transformations be clear and make sure we're all on the same page here. So those are linear Transformations Define from where to where what is the domain for these to make sense?  Yeah, it's a three dimensional Vector right X is going to be in R3 because the matrices A and B. They have three columns and our definition of matrix multiplication of matrix by scalar. Is it take a pot pie and use them as a coefficient? And then what's the output? So these these functions t&s. These are functions from R3.  R32 what where is the output someone from over here?  8 * X is what size Vector in this case.  I heard several people over here. Say it quietly, but I'd like someone to say it loudly.  Okay someone else in the room.  R2  because there's no  Hey, it's a mapping. It's a rule as I can do on pictures that I can do those operations on functions in calculus or your high school precalculus class. If I give you two functions f x equals x 9 x or you can take the function f + G can take the function by adding up those function the function operations you can do in the rain you can do you can do in the functions to the same space R2.  30 + S is a new function value at x equals X Plus  ax  hbx  Okay, but now by the linear properties of matrix multiplication. This is the same thing.  as a + b * X  Okay, that's how we've defined a and the sum of A and B and that's how it works. Okay. So in other words what we have is that this linear transformation t plus s  It's standard. Matrix is A + B. That's what the sum of two matrices is the standard tip for going to add up when your Transformations which we might well do that means we add the matrices and similarly if we do scalar multiplication, I so if we do our genes are * x * x x + by scalar multiplication of matrices as we just saw this is our times a applied to x 2 similarly that says that this linear transformation has this is it standard Matrix.  That's what it means.  And it's important to keep that straight because for example just going back for a second here and the the first slide, you know, we multiply Day by to there and then we did that. We scaled all of the entries up by 2.  If the operation we were doing was a row operation, then we would probably do that one at a time scale the first one by two and then the second one by two but you can't do them independently when you're doing scalar multiplication scalar multiplication of a matrix by scalar. You can't choose which row or column  All right. So that's what Edition is going to multiplication of matrices means it means we're taking Editions.  So there's one at least one other operation that we can do on scale on linear Transformations when they have appropriately matching sizes. So many Transformations are functions if I have a function from here to here and a different functions that starts with the other one ended go somewhere else. Then I can compose the functions one function by the other. So suppose. I have a function like to be here when your transformation from RN to RM. I have a different linear transformation ass from RM to RK.  Jennifer some positive integers n M&K, then I can compose the two of them. I can follow as I can follow tea by us. Okay, so that means I can go from here to here and I get a new function which is called s Circle T. This is just under should be review for you not from the offer. But from previous courses just function ideas. So ask compose with T is the new function whose values you first evaluate.  T-Rex that gives you a point in the range but the range of tea is in RM and RM is the domain of a switch in a composition of functions.  And I give this a new function.  The composition of two linear transformations of appropriate size of is the same as the domain of us we can compose them.  I have a new function linear Transformations aren't just any old functions that super special functions. They are linear. They respect addition and scalar multiplication.  This composition I didn't tell you it's a linear transformation. All we know is that it's a function from our end to RK or end of November to RK, but actually it is another linear transformation. I want to show you why briefly here at you posed to be. Well, let's just write down what we just said. The definition is that means we're taking s and hitting the vector T at U + V with it.  Let's ignore that asked for a moment then just look in the side there with t of you plus me a linear transformation. So tell me how does that relate to the values that you and  Remember, what is a linear transformation do to a song?  Someone likes to raise their hand and tell me what TV plus equal to.  Yes.  Is equal to 2 + tfv8 respect the addition not there could be many answers to the question. I just asked it was a bit open open-ended. So I was asking you to Intuit what the next step in this calculation ought to be  Okay, so great since he is linear function f g help us say anything about Eskimos with this looks complicated. But let's just change notation a little bit. Let's call this a vector ex and this Vector why? Okay. So exit Vector 2, why is the vector TV?  Okay, I'm looking to team Sr end into RM X and Y are vectors in RM just to be clear as we're going through this. So let's rewrite this this says that this is s of x + y  But this is also a linear transformation respect Edition. So that's equal to as of x + S of Y.  And now let's remember what X and Y are from one line above their.  X is equal to T of you  And why is equal to t a v?  And now we're in something which actually tells us about s compose with t because look up at the top right there as compose with C is the function.  which does operations involving exactly that Duty and then follow ass after work and each of those two spots just asked compose with T at you plus s compose with t  So what does that say? Just going from the beginning of the equation to the end?  That's as we've shown that is composed of T is is a function with a property that it's value on you. Capacity at V.  That's respect Edition sees through the addition and a very similar calculation will show you that you can push scalar multiplication through S compose with t as well, I won't write down all the steps. It looks very similar.  So that says that compose with t respects.  addition and scalar multiplication  But that's what it means to be a linear transformation is a linear transformation.  So if I have two linear Transformations and the codomain of one of them is the same as the domain of the other so that it makes sense to the composition of linear transformation function, which has the same nice properties that respects addition and scalar multiplication.  Linear transformation has a standard Matrix transformation matrix.  You know here I gave you a S&T. I didn't tell you what their matrices were if I can figure out what their matrices are. That's how I figured out. We have a matrix in the first place, but I didn't use the matrices of abstract linear transformation properties.  Their question. Yes.  Respect addition and scalar multiplication. I tried to write a shorthand and now I'm going to end up writing it longhand in spending more time. Sorry respect Edition.  and scalar multiplication  I guess you know, well your study if you take everything we've just down to one word. Probably not going to help very much, right, so there's a limit to how much shortening.  Okay, so as I was saying I didn't use the matrices of S&T here in any way but the thing to remember is composed with T is a linear transformation as we just proved it has a matrix as well.  So how would the Matrix of Eskimos with to be related to the matrices of s and t is the question before us?  So let's figure that out right now.  So same as in the last spot, I have a linear transformation T from RN to RM. I've a linear transformation ask RM to RK and we're still doing this in general here when specific examples.  The Matrix tea has has has a matrix A&S has a matrix B, I just to be clear so remember how this works. So if T is a linear transformation from R2 send the Matrix has what size from over this half of the room.  m x n x n  an s itsmatrix b will be of size K by m  alright, so  hey is m x n that means it has M Rose and N columns as stringing together. It's called that has n columns.  I want to figure out what the Matrix of s compose with Tia's.  So let's just start messing around using the properties of Matrix. We know what the matrices A and B are so we need to do is figure out a multiplication by some Matrix. What Matrix is it? How do we figure that out? Well, we know what S&T do I so T is given by multiplication by a plus first right that  And let's write the vector X here as usual. So the vector ex is in RN.  the multiplication of a BX. In terms of The Columns of a all that means by definition is we use x to officiants of the linear combination of The Columns of a  okay. So now I've written that things out as a mixture of a sand and the Matrix a before I use the fact that ass is given by multiplication bye-bye. Let's just use the abstract linear properties of the linear transformation s s respect addition and scalar multiplication as respect super positions. We have the superposition principle that says that we can take  x 1 x 1 x 2 x s of a 2 down the line  Okay. So what we've learned from this is it to figure out what s compose with t does 2x. I really only need to know what the linear transformation ask does to The Columns of a  but has given by multiplication by matrix be so this is b x a one this one is the X A2 etcetera.  Xn there be times a.m.  Hey, those are some column vectors if I take a column Vector a 1in x The Matrix B, which I can do cuz the sauces matchup.  I'm taking a linear combination of those columns, but what I've written here is exactly.  we like to encode as  The Matrix whose entries whose columns are those new columns  X the column vector  text  and now I have written test compose with t entirely in terms of the matrices because this statement right here.  the eskimos with t x is equal to  this Matrix right here.  x x  that tells us that this Matrix right here.  This is the standard Matrix.  August composer t  That's a circle not an hour.  Okay, so that's the answer to this question. If I have two transformations codomain of the first matches the domain of the second so I can have the standard Matrix and that's it right there. And it's something we can now compute. It's just a little extension of matrix multiplication. We already Define I give you two matrices A and B.  I write out a The Columns of a matrix multiplication of each column of a matrix. Is the Matrix of s composed with T. So there's the definition that I just said out loud one more time.  And that is how we Define matrix multiplication multiply a matrix times a vector.  Hey, as long as the number of columns of the Matrix matches the number of entries of the vector. We knew how to find that he's been able to find the product of those two matrices more or less the same way. I just do it Colin Wise by X by X by X Columns of a together.  Assuming that the sizes match for that to make sense. So let's do an example right now. He's fixed gear is has three rows into columns. The second one is in two columns.  In order for this matrix multiplication to make sense even just call them lies from the definition. We know that the number of entries in each of the columns for the second Matrix has to match the number of entries in the rows of the first Matrix. That is the number of columns of the first Matrix what that means when you're looking at their sizes is that the two inside numbers have to match  Exactly by definition the definition of we take that first Matrix. Okay that first Matrix, let's call it be there. And this one is a that means we take the X the First Column of a as the First Column of our Matrix and D X the second column of a  as the second column for Matrix. So let's let's work that out exactly.  so d x the First Column that means we take one and two and use it as a linear combinations of The Columns of B is let me write it explicitly that's going to be 1 * 4 + 2 * -2  In the second entry. It's going to be 1 * -3.  + 0 * 200 + 2 * 0 I guess we should write it as and then finally 1 * 3.  + 2 * 5  so that's the First Column. Let me actually write a, here to make sure we understand that's just the First Column of the Matrix Pete times a day for the second column. We have to use the coefficients in the second column of a linear combination to The Columns of be so now we have 3 * 4 - 1 * -2  3 * -3  + -1 * 0  and 3 * 3  -1 * 5  okay, so now let's simplify that I get 4 - 4 which is 0 - 3 + 0 which is -3  3 + 10 which is 13 for the First Column. The second column is 12 + 2 + 14 - 9 - 0 + 9 - 5 wishes for mechanical and actually just like with matrix multiplication. If I of a matrix by a column Vector if I don't want to go through all the steps that I did here and think of it as a linear combination of The Columns of the first by the entries in the second light by The Columns in the second. I can do the second way of thinking about that multiply first row of first column of air and adding them up that would give me this entry here and multiplying in this one.  Buy this one gives me that entry there and so on so you should do lots of practice problems like this.  But that's the end of the story about matrix multiplication really represents the composition of Transformations extension of what you already been doing with matrix multiplication of a matrix by column Vector. Okay. So let's do another example hear about these two matrices. How do I multiply these two  You don't someone said that's right. You don't and why don't these guys don't match?  So you can't X if it doesn't even make sense, but I want you to look at something.  The Matrix here the first one here, that's a that's the same one that's up there and the Matrix down here that's be so if I were to make sense of this this one would be a * B  So beat is this particular Matrix and does not even make sense.  This is the warning that I gave you last time.  Not every property of real algebra is going to translate to Matrix algebra.  In real algebra doesn't matter what order you multiply numbers but in Matrix algebra, not only does it matter what order it can fail to make sense to multiply in one order. Even if it does in the first, okay, here's an example of perfect tense, but is not even to find  All right. So other than most of the other properties  Real multiplication make perfect sense and and are satisfied by matrix product. That is matrix product is associative * a * B and then see afterward or I can multiply be 10 cm in a beforehand as long as I keep the order straight.  Matrix multiplication is distributive over Matrix addition to the adding before or after the product on either side and scalar multiplication of a matrix distributes through and that's no problem. You can scale the multiply any of the matrices it won't matter which order you do it.  And also just like as an additive identity the zero Matrix, there's also a multiplicative identity an M by n Matrix, then I can * certain Matrix called the identity Matrix Multiplied on you have to use a different size Matrix. If a is MBA  Then if I'm going to multiply on the left.  I need to use an MBM identity Matrix for those two to match. Whereas I used to have a you need to use an N by n identity Matrix.  For them to match if I do it on the right different sizes identities on different sides sides if they are not Square Saturn Matrix of the identity function in Matrix algebra. It also is the identity function multiplying by it gives you the same answer back just as you're going through your man for that.  Is generally not equal to ba.  It's not just some abstract weird algebraic that that is a property of our world. I'd like to volunteers to come down to do a demonstration if you don't mind, but anyone like to come down to the station, yes, come on one other person, please.  Come on down. Come on up. Okay, remember last day and the day before Transformations. So that means I can do multiplication of the matrices associated with algebra right now as it as a contact sport, so here are two rotations. So I want you to rotate 90 degrees.  Hey, I know I want you to rotate 90 degrees down onto your face.  Okay, fine. If you want. No, just those were two rotations that he just did 90\u00b0 that way and then 90\u00b0 that way that way.  Good degrees that way.  Look are they in the same position rotations this one and that one versus that one versus that one and that one the same a x b x are there and we got totally different answers.  Three-dimensional rotations don't compete with each other it matters what order you do the rotations around this.  in fact if you just pick two random matrices  They will not compete with each other very special when two messages commute. It doesn't happen that often. Let's try that right now. Let's pick a lock.  I got a herd of 4.  473 and 484 more numbers  298  I heard I heard a 3K. Thank you. Good.  Matrices in that order just for practice here for 734 * 2983.  Okay, so doing the shorthand way. What I'm going to do is multiply 7 * 864  4 * 9 + 7 * 3 + 36 + 21, which is 53 * 2 is 6 + 4 * 38.  + 3 * 927 + 12 is 39. So there is the product of those two matrices and multiply them.  in the reverse order  I'm going to feel like an idiot if he's actually come you too, but they want they want a list of the first one there to * 4 + 9 * 3/8 + 27 is 35 and actually we don't even need to go any further.  Those two are not equal.  Hey, so I'm not going to finish the algebra. You guys can do that.  I picked to Macy's out of thin air and I got two different answers for the products in the two different ways. That's pretty much always going to happen. If I write down that relatively speaking. Actually we can explore that a little bit more when we have a little more language in a few weeks.  The definition of matrix multiplication using it from now on the key thing to remember is Matrix addition. They mostly work the way you expect algebra to work the size of need to match appropriately that means different things from application versus Edition. And the second thing is that well addition multiplication of matrices typically does not commute it matters what order and actually it might matter what order weather would even make sense or not. But even if it makes sense answers will typically be different.  Okay, and in the last 2 minutes is one more Matrix operation that I want to highlight here.  Okay, it's a very very easy one mechanically to do. I'm only going to tell you mechanically what does have an interpretation in terms of linear transformation, but it's a little more sophisticated we'll get to it and what it means but for now, it's going to be an M by n Matrix.  It's transpose is an N by m Matrix It swaps and an m and the way that it is to swap the rows of a with The Columns of s a look at that.  So to take the transpose of a matrix.  you just  flip it on its side.  Hey, you take the rose of a and you write them as The Columns of a new Matrix. That's it. That's what we need. Any more time. Let's confuse the transposes of these two matrices 1-0, I turn into the column.  better than that 2 - 3/4 turn into the column + 013  That's it. So let's do this Matrix over here is one of the three by three example, so if you're I'm going to I'm going to do the same thing. Let even do the colors to make it clear and I'm taking this First Column this first row there and I'm making it the First Column of this Matrix.  Okay, and then the second column?  I'm making that II II Raw making the second column over here.  And this third row 6-1 for I'm turning that into the third column over here.  There we go. See totally different Matrix, right?  White let's let's look did I do it wrong?  Actually, it's the same Matrix.  What happened?  What happened is that this is a cooked up example. This Matrix is called a symmetric Matrix a matrix that gives you its own transpose. Matrix is called a symmetric Matrix transpose. It actually gave me the same answer back because the columns in the Rose have the same numbers in them when you reflect across the bag and I didn't change most major cities are not like that, but they are super important matrices in the last week of the class will explain why properties here. Okay, the most important one probably is that it doesn't respect multiplication, but it reverses it, but that's probably not going to be necessary for us until week 9, so we'll talk about that more then and that's where we're finished for today. See you on Wednesday.  one minute early guys "
