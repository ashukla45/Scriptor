Today we are going to be continuing with our finishing what we started last day with the Matrix equation ax equals B.  And moving on to section 1.5 a certified more complete than what theoretical description of solution set of linear systems of equations.  And next time on Monday. We will move onto linear Independence.  Your reminders that you have MyMathLab homework number one and number two. They're both do this coming Monday the next day of class Monday after this weekend due by 11:59 p.m. Please make sure to get those done by then and you have not lab homework number one, which is due tonight by 11:59 p.m. Submit it to have already been admitted to the class already got the email long ago about being registered in gradescope course for not allowed for this course. So you have instructions on how to do that. If you haven't done so already if you were still on the wait list and have now been admitted that you will get an e-mail sometime today or possibly later on on the weekend and which case will extend the deadline for you. Don't worry to upload those two gradescope comment about the  Size of the room dusty over in the back. There are three or four seats are enough seats for everybody because it is possible that the fire marshal could come in and do a spot check. Now that happens in principle. They could shut down the building. What would you should sit in it? Which means that please please please get here early so that you're not coming and sitting in the seats while people are already and you're interrupting class, but please sit in the seats if there are seats available.  Alright, so let us proceed.  With today's lecture, so I'm going to start with where we finished last day, which is this theorem that we demonstrated through several examples and discuss why it's true and we'll see more examples right now to understand this better. Tell you what the Matrix equation ax equals be for some Matrix a some vector be where the vector v has the same height as the Matrix the same number of rows. Okay, and that's the condition for the for that to be possible to ask about whether it's solvable because remember that a x x is really a hand for use the coefficients in X to make a linear combination of The Columns of a and so forth that linear combination of The Columns of a 2 equals. He has to live in the same rights of those columns are height 7 then be has to have hiked 7, so we're interested in The Matrix equation x equals B, and if we have a particular be so if you have a matrix AI give you a name.  Send the way to answer the question. Can you solve ax equals Vita to write down the augmented Matrix a dotted lines B. And now you have that linear system eukaryote to row Echelon form or reduced row Echelon form. If you want to know what the solution is and you solve the system, but the more general question is okay. I give you a matrix a but I'm interested in the following question. Is it true that I can solve the system ax equals be for any be I'm going to get different solutions for different no matter what?  Sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not and what is the exact condition for that? So again to let the first three are just restatements using all the new language was developed in this week of that statement. So if you are for logically equivalent statements any one of these statements is true exactly when all of the other car so the question is 10 supposed to be a definition as we said by definition of matrix multiplication that's equivalent to the statement for any Vector B. Vector B is a linear combination of The Columns of a that's what x equals B says.  And similarly just using the word Stan what you all need to get accustomed to. I heard from the sections doctors that you were talking about Spanish yesterday and it's something that you didn't appear to be comfortable with you which isn't surprising because it's a new world. It's a New Concept. It's a little bit more abstract than things we've seen before which is why you need to spend extra time studying and reading and doing examples to understand it better, but believe me you can understand it really well by the end of next week. For example a thousand more examples with it, maybe only 500 but many more. So just another restatement of Part B. Is that The Columns of a span are and that's exactly what is the span of the columns is the set of linear combinations of those columns and a span RMS to say that every vector be in RM is a linear combination of those columns.  And then finally the key Point here, which is how we actually answer. The question is what you do is you take just a you forget there is no bmeb is not a sad thing as you answered for all be just take a and you reduce it to row Echelon form and you check to see where the pivots are if there's a pivot in every row of a that is if there's no rows of zeros in a in the row Echelon form of a then you can ask if there's a row of zeros for more than one row 0 is in the road and I in any row Echelon form of a then know there will be some vectors be you can't find in the span of The Columns of a  Okay, so let's let's cement that with another example as we did last day had an affirmative answer to these four properties that x equals me was always solvable for everybody. So let's do an example. Guess. I'm giving away the  so we could have this is not an augmented Matrix is the augmented part of the Matrix is just you keeping track of what color means what for you and it's given situation or thinking of this as the coefficient Matrix of some system. So if we were going to solve a particular system x equals B, you have another column B on the right hand side. So we have our own Matrix and we want to answer the question Do The Columns of that Matrix fan all of our three the first of all make sure that that even make sense.  So the columns are a height 3. So that means that they're span that is a set of linear combinations. Those columns is a collection of vectors in R3. So ask this question is an ax equals be solved for any Vector bnr34 every single day that we just need to see if every column the story of every row in a is Thibodaux. So I've gone ahead and use Matlab to find the reduced row Echelon form of a it's written right here.  Can you see that there's some fractions there and I want to make sure you're not worried when you see fractions most examples I do in class and they have been cooked up on your homework. They're cooked up so that you only end up doing integer arithmetic just to make things easier but by and large if I put a random Matrix operations random Matrix Theory, you never have integers there. You always have infinite decimal points almost always going to be doing random matrices. He sees that work out so that you're not wasting your time doing awful arithmetic instead of understanding the concept but we do have to be prepared to see some fractions row reduction and we'll do a little bit of it in a moment. You'll see that you have 2/3 at some point and get some of the numbers there will not be integers. That's not what matters what matters  We can now answer the question from the fair on the theremin the last page said.  You can solve ax equals B for any given be precisely when precisely when he has a pivot.  and each and every rough  so  Does have a pivot in each and every row here?  No.  My phone actually isn't working.  Okay. Yes, that is correct does not have a pivot in every road. The last row has no pivot.  Hello.  Okay, I'm sorry.  so some of  some of this lecture unfortunately will be Visual and not Audible.  So the last row of a is not typical hear that their 4X equals B is not example remember the serum Cesaro. The definition of matrix multiplication equals B is saying that V is in the linear is a linear combination of The Columns of a  So for example, if I were to put the First Column of a 3-3 6 let's call that be then I know I can solve ax equals be for that be because that b is a linear combination the column today. It's linear combination where I use One X the First Column plus there are tons of second-place are * 1/3 + 0 * 1/4 solutions that for which there are solutions to act.  So let's look at a specific example.  Ask a question. Can I solve ax equals B is the vector 001  What do you think just looking at at what's on the board here? I'm going to give you 10 seconds to talk to your neighbor and we'll answer the question yes, or no with a vote.  All right, let's do that about now how many people think that ax equals 001 has a solution.  How many people think that it does not have a solution?  Okay, so that's majority voted and said that it doesn't have a solution would someone like to explain why they came to that conclusion?  guess  Okay, so if you put that zero zero one next to the Matrix of bone is there makes the last calling would be pivotal and you would have an equation 0 equals no solution. That's probably the reason you. All right.  The answer was correct, but for the totally wrong reason.  Because you can't put that column next to the reduced row Echelon form of the question was not.  Thanks for the Matrix of the Tapas. And this Matrix here is a twiddle. It's a different Matrix, but that doesn't mean that solving a little ax equals B is the same as  We got from a to a twiddle by row operations.  Okay, if I had a b a pendants and I wanted to solve that operations.  So what I have to do.  They have to start again with the be attended to a operations on the whole thing and see if I get see if I get a check in the last column or not.  Okay. Now the reason that you stopped making that stuff mistake, which I was hoping you it all makes a thank you very much cuz it's I wanted to make sure to demonstrate that that's a common mistake. You need to avoid. The reason that you thought that it was once made that mistake that this answer. The question is how you leave a one down there at the bottom and all zeros everywhere else that says it's an inconsistent system. It's almost right that everything is almost right. See when I attend is there. Is there a one down there and I start doing real operations.  Because there's zero is there.  The row operations where you buy something or add one row to another one that really we will just have a 001 there. Is that not always true.  Can someone explain to me? Why why it could go wrong?  I'll maybe I'm lying to you and it and it can't go wrong.  Okay, you're right that if I had given you a different Vector like two three one then but what I'm asking is if I if I do operations to carry this augmented Matrix at the bottom.  Operations I just mentioned are not going to affect those zeros will always have.  Exactly. There's one more kind of role operation swapping to Rose and that could move the one somewhere else and you have to go through the operations to see if we actually needed a row swap here or not to get to the registration one-on-one is in there. Not you actually have to do the operation just for practice. Let's do a few of them anyway.  Okay. So what we're going to do if you want to get the zero in the second row below the first in and First Column, so we do that by I'm not going to write with your operation for using now you should be expert enough to reconstructed after work, but I'll say it out loud. We're going to add the first row to the second.  Second star design zero there gives us a three here zero here three there. And of course hero there.  Okay, and now we're also going to get a zero in the  Last row in the First Column by subtracting twice the first row from that one giving us their desired 0 there twice 5 from 1-9. I have to subtract twice -4 from -8, but that means adding a 2-8 giving me a 01 - 79  and the zero that means I'm not doing anything to this one.  Okay now that I would do.  Start would divide the first row and the second row by 3, which is by the way why we're going to get that fractions with a 3 in the bottom. But what happened was in the bottom row, we know we're going to get zeros in the a part but I told you that and you can now see why because ignoring the last column II each other. The third row is -3 times the second row at this stage of the row reduction. So if I know that I'll write this one just to be clear If I multiply the second row by -3 and add it to the third row and put the result in the third row.  That actually killed the third row.  You're right. Thank you.  But it doesn't kill the 1 2 3 * 0 to 1 and I get the one there we can stop that. We're not in what we are in a row Echelon form. But now this thing is in a row Echelon form and now we can see. Oh, yes, it is problematic. We did not turned out to work in this case, but you have to be careful cuz it might have been the case if there was a real swell.  Okay, so to illustrate again this year I'm going to go back again. The therapist says that equals B can be solved for every be if and only if he has a pivot in every row so why is that true? So we saw here in this example that forgetting about rose quartz for the moment. It's because if I don't have a pivot in every road, that means the Quan Farmers going to have a row of zeros, which means I could take a vector like zero zero one independent there and I'm going to get an inconsistency doesn't quite work because of the possibility of necessary row swaps, but if in this example we had needed and that one had ended up in the second row instead of the third we should have started with the vectors 010 and then that roast while we needed would have put the one down below where we needed it. So you see this theorem is true because we can always use one of the vectors there is no 14010 or  1001 of the vectors with a 1 in one place and is there is everywhere else appendix hurt at the end of the backwards for which x equals B Kathy sauce? This is a really important point.  Number of pivotal Rose how many how many linearly independent columns there are it tells us really how much information is there any equations? There are three equations represented by a butt because of which means we can't possibly expect to solve it for every Vector in three dimensional space where there's three.  Okay, so that's the key here. We need to look to see the form and see whether or not there's a row of zeros if there is then there must be some.  All right. Great. That was a section on Matrix equation. Now moving onto solution sets of linear system Michael Cera which summarizes some of the calculations that we've done it in a way. That's that's not really but before we embarked on this description of solution sets. I want to review basically with John in the first for lectures. Hey, we started this course talking about linear systems of equations with quickly use the new notation and operations last Christmas.  Sounds like different problems, but turn out to be the same thing Vector equations and Matrix equations. Okay, and then we saw that all four of those are different representations of the same thing solving linear systems of equations. So I want to remind us of how that works here. But the same time I want to now start to use some new language every quarter you going to have to make sure you learn and understand those words. So I want to talk about two different kinds of linear systems now,  and it's all about what the be on the right hand side is  so the nicest cases When the Beat Drops  do we call such a system homogeneous system is a system where if we read it as a matrix equation has the form ax equals 0 for the be on the right hand side is zero a that's a homogeneous system of equation. And if it's not homogeneous, we call it in homogeneous will look at examples of that on the next slide, but just to cement this so here here's an example of a homogeneous system of equations for x 1 + 5 x 2 - 4 x 3 equals 0 - 3 x 1 - 2 x 2 + 4 x 3 equals 0 what makes it homogeneous is just the fact this is the stuff on the right hand side and 0  Okay.  So this is the system of two equations in three unknowns. It's a homogeneous system of two equations.  No, just to remind us of all the different ways we could represent this. So we saw yesterday or last day Wednesday. My three-year-old daughter uses the term yesterday to mean anything in the past. So I may use it that way as well. I apologize if it's confusing and tomorrow means anything in the future as well. So your final is tomorrow anybody panicking or was everyone actually laughing but it was not actually tomorrow last lecture. We talked about Matrix equations, and we saw that this system of equations can be written as the following Matrix equation. We write the coefficient Matrix, which is just given by the coefficients in front.  of the variables  x x 1 x 2 x 3 is equal to 200 equivalent to that Matrix equation.  On the other hand, we saw the day before that also yesterday that this system of equations can be written as a vector equation where we take the columns corresponding to the X1 X2 and X3 variable and write them is separated vectors.  X those X coefficients  and then finally at the very beginning we said, you know, if we're going to solve that system. Let's just discard the X notation from the start to save ourselves writing and just write the augmented Matrix which we will then do row operations on.  I like to put that dotted line, but your textbook doesn't and that is the augmented Matrix representing that system. So all four of these are just different notation for the exact same thing the system of equations.  This system of equations and what makes it homogeneous is that it's zeros all zeros on the right hand side of the equation. So that's a homogeneous system in those are all of the ways we can represent one.  So let's look at some examples.  Why do we have this funny word? Why are we adding a new word? If we just I mean I could tell you let's call a system hunky-dory if the numbers on the right hand side or 1 and 7. That would be very silly new words to learn.  Okay, because it doesn't have anything special about it. But there is something special about having only zeros on the right hand side. What special is this? Usually for any system of things that can happen with the solution set the solutions that could be empty Solutions. It could have exactly one solution or infinitely many solutions and the things they can't have that first possibility. They always have at least one solution system by setting all the variables equal to zero.  Let's go actually back to this life.  If I set X1 X2 and X3 equal to 0 then automatically I get 0 for each of those equations.  Okay, just buy the form of the equation. That's what's great about homogeneous system. You can always say I know there's going to be a solution 0 is a solution solution or you can have infinitely many solutions that you can never be an unfortunate situation.  Okay. So let's look at two examples here and will give us a new language for describing those solution sets of homogeneous systems were going to do the same thing. We've been doing for the last four lectures to solve these systems by converting it to reduced row Echelon form. These are small enough that it's just going to take two or three steps so we can do them really quickly here.  So with this first one here, I'm going to add the first row to the second.  that gives me  this by the way, we actually already did this. I've just taken the first two rows of this Matrix so we can just repeat exactly the same operations we did there so I could just copy and paste on over but may as well do it again.  3 5-4  00 and now I'm going to Pivot so I'm going to  Divide the last row by 3.  And now I'm almost in row Echelon form.  I'm the one for him, but to fully solve the system. I want to be in reduced row Echelon form. So I'm going to add -5 of time of the second row to the first row that still has the three up there and that's going to give desired 0-0 down there.  Answer the last thing we have to do is divide that first row by 3 to get it to see that minus 4/3.  So is there unless I made a mistake but I don't think we did there is the reduced row Echelon form of this augmented Matrix so we know what to do. Now if I want to describe the solutions, that's the first of all I have a unique solution.  Is there a unique solution?  No is a not even a solution because there's a free variable. This column here doesn't have a pivot in it doesn't have a leading wanted it corresponds to a free variable x 3 is a free variable which means that our solution set is not going to be functions of the equations that I guess from there. They now the reduced equations 2x 1 - 4/3 x 3 equals 0 and x 2  equals 0  Okay, so X2 is pin down but X1 is only determined by X3. So in other words I write that the solution set looks like X1 X2 X3 equals.  4/3 x 3  0 + x 3 + that's the best I can say now. I'm just going to give you some new notation here, which is to say we want in parametric form and all that means we're going to rename the three variables, but in other words, this just says x 1 is equal to 4/3 sx2 is equal to 0 + x 3 is equal to pass.  Okay, what what have I done that let me do one more step here and I'm going to factor out that ass and I can write this is f x 4/3 0.  and one  the says that the solution looks like * 4/3 Euro 14 n e s s is this free variable s is this parameter, so what it tells me is that I can set ask people to anything I want and I'll get a solution of this system. I have a 1 parameter family of solutions.  And if you think about this a little bit what it's saying is I have this Vector for 3rd 01.  Find the solution set looks like all the multiples of that Vector which is the same thing as saying.  The solution set is the span of that one vector or thirds 01.  That's what a solution set looks like in this case is the span of a single Vector which means the lines for that doctor all points on the line through that Vector are solutions. Okay, by the way, it's not a unique Vector that works there instead of 4:03 and I could use that veteran say hi. Is this sector the vector is not the solution set is this  That's what we call a parametric solution would describe the solution as a set of points that are in the span of some vectors or it could be more complicated. So here's an augmented Matrix corresponding to a system of two equations in 4 unknowns a homogeneous system cuz they're zeros on the right hand side.  So let's do our row operations. What should I do? What should I do?  Yeah, I can subtract the second row the first row from the second. But you know what I'm going to do something different to have a little fun here Opera 1 and Row 2. I'm allowed to do that.  And the reason I did that is now if I subtract Row 1 from Row 2 to get my desired 0 down there.  Then this is zero that I have up here and it means there's just a little less arithmetic.  And actually this Matrix is now already in reduced row Echelon form. If I had done the algorithm straightforward and said let's subtract the first row from the second and proceed it would have required one more step and sometimes it can be good to be clever and do some some swap sir. Something else first does not have a unique solution because there are three variables how many free variables here?  Two free variables. Okay this one and this one.  Different color to the second one. Those are free variables. So X3 and X4 going to be x 1 + x 3 + 2 x 4 equal 0 and x 2  + x 3 - x 4 - 3 x 4 equals 0 write the solution set as  X1 X2 X3 X4  I would write it in terms but let me go right away and renamed X3 chronically letters like r s t u v that's going to letters for the parameters here. And so if I take those equations I can say I will X1 is going to be equal to - x 3 - 2 x 4 - x - 2 t  X2 is equal to - x 3 + 3 x 4 which is -8 + 3 t x 3 is equal to SX4 is equal to so that is a description of the parametric Solutions hear. Let me go one more step here.  And write this in a nice way, which is to pull out everything that has an s in it to let everything that has a t in it and write it as two separate column vectors. So that's equal to ask * -1 - 110 + 50 x - 2 3 0 1  It's can be tricky the first time you see this you're going backwards. Usually you would combine them together. But here we're going backwards everything. You see with an S. You separated. Everything is humidity. You step right up. And the reason I wrote it this way is that now we see what is the solution set in consists of all vectors that are some scalar multiple of that for Spectre - 1 - 110 + - 2301 where the S&T can be anything we want.  In other words by definition the parametric solution here says that the solution set is equal to the span of the two vectors. -1 - 110 - 2301  So this should really help you understand what that's what's been means stand mean multiples of factors. But this is where it comes up or one place of comes off is in the solution set of a homogeneous system of equations. I pay you get three variables in this free variable so you can set them equal to whatever you want and you have to that determines the other variable values but if the X1 X2 X3 and X4 equal to its going to equal a span of some vectors the set of all possible combinations of some vectors is the number of vectors is going to equal the number of three variables. So the number three variables determines how big the solution set is how many parameters that has  The both of you have the solution set is in but the second one is sort of a bigger than the set than the first same incident size, but they are geometrically different. The first one is a line. The second one is a plane which is bigger.  So that's the whole story on homogeneous system and it was critical here that we had zeros on the right hand side. The solution set is the span of some collection of vectors.  That's not quite what happens for an in-home Virginia system and an homogeneous system is one that is not homogeneous.  Is it actually reminds me I should have mentioned at the beginning that there's a famous quote from passed away only about 10 years ago famous for being one of those may be able to prove the properties of the mandelbrot set. If you're part of the mandelbrot set should look it up. It's a fun thing but systems which is the study of nonlinear system linear system is like dividing the world into bananas vs. Non-venomous because almost everything we talked about in the world can be in some nicely approximated by linear systems. Most of things I care about cannot be well approximated by bananas.  Maybe for you is different. But for me, that's that's the case has another distinction between homogeneous and non-homogeneous in most systems are in homogeneous. You write down random number. They're they're almost never going to be zero but it turns out that the difference is something we can understand. It's not so so subtle. It's just just one extra stuff here. So let's demonstrate what happens with an in homogeneous system here. This is the coefficient Matrix. Was it on the last flight? Is that won the second example there there we were solving a system with some Nature's ax equals 0 and now we're doing that same Matrix ax equals equals. 434, 3  So let's carry this to reduced row Echelon form to find the solution set.  I'm going to do the same trick. I did last time I swap the two rows to save myself one step of row reduction to get to the reduced row Echelon form.  Okay, and now we do the same thing as before we subtract the first row from the second that gives us zero there doesn't affect that one cuz of his Euro there gives us a one there in a -3 and now the important thing is what happens to the final column. We have to know pay attention. We don't have zeros there. So it will be affected by the and that gives us the one here.  Okay. I know the system is in reduced row Echelon form or I'll call that won t and so I'm just going to pick off from there. Just following exactly the same thing. We did before X1 X2 X3 and X4. It says X1 + S + 2 T equals 3.  okay, so that means that subtracting I'm going to get X1 is equal to - s - 2T + 3  the second row x 2 + -3 T equals 1 x 2 is equal to - s + 3 + 1 and then just like before by definition. We have x 3 is equal to ask next four is equal to T.  Now let me write that out like I did before this is a perfectly good Final Answer here is the parametric solution of this system. Every solution looks like this you choose your teachers if they want they could both be zero, they could be one and seven. They could be pie and see whatever real numbers you want. You got a solution.  But let's not nicer forum.  Where we separate out the asses and the t's so this is a test times just like before - 1 - 110 + x - 2301 but now there's some extra junk the extra junk is I haven't accounted yet for the three in the one that showed up there that don't have an answer if that's what systems do a third piece of the puzzle.  which is  and this case that factor that  Okay, so compare this to what we had down here.  The difference is just that third piece of the puzzle. So this was the system we solved.  This is a typo here this there was supposed to be a 0-0 here. So this is the thing in the linear, that is a linear combination of these two vectors span of those two vectors for the corresponding in homogeneous system here with the Matrix but a non-zero be on the right side. We got that the solution set looks like  Something in the span of those two vectors nonzero thing.  In other words down here. We had a plane the plane say say these two vectors represent that plane. Okay. It's a plane but what's critical here is that it's a plane passing through the origin.  0 is a solution. How much is systems always have 0 is a solution of the origin is my throat here in my torso here. Then what's the solution set of discourse running in and how much in your system? It's that plane. It's a plane that is not passing through the origin origin stays fixed in space translation of that plane. It's a parallel plane but moved  Moved away from the origin in the direction of this Vector 3100 and that's the general situation here.  If you solve the homogeneous system than any solution of any in homogeneous system with the same coefficient. Matrix is going to look like that solution but shifted transmitted by some particular. This is called a particular solution.  Okay this last Park here. So we have some particular solution and we use it to translate the homogeneous solution that gives us an in homogeneous solution be careful particular, but that's not true at all. I could have to find out what the particular solution is here. I said S&T zero.  But I could just as well have set a sequel to Juan and t equal to zero may be. Okay, and that would give me another particular solution. If I did that then I would have to take well, that would give me the vector -1 - 110 + 310 is that would give me the vector 2 0 1 0  okay, so you could just as well write this as  now I have to use a different letter. Let me call it our  - 1 1 - 1 - 1 1 0 plus another letter. Let's call it you - 2301 + that different particular factor, which was what I get. When I add the first one to the third one 1010. This is a different particular solution.  So what we get is it's the same thing over there for the I'm using different 4-1 not priming. Are you that actually turns out to be the same as but it doesn't matter cuz I can set them equal to whatever I want. I just renamed them something different. So I get the same Spanish that the same plane but transmitted by a different Vector, but all that means is that I'm translating over here. Can I get the same place? You should think about thinking about that, but I wanted to make sure there isn't a single particular solution.  There will be some in homogeneous solution loss of them and then you take the homogeneous solution and translated by any one of those and you get the full question.  Always Solutions are equal.  Depends what you mean is our only solution is parallel. So if you mean all possible ways of writing down the solution of x equals be for a particular be there all the same. It's just the solution set for that particular, but you could write it in different ways. That's all we've done here in this last moment. But if the question was a bigger question all the different solution sets for all the systems ax equals b y p varies then the answer is yes, although solution sets will be parallel planes or lines are parallel three dimensional spaces and 17 dimensional space with him like that. There's a massive lecture. So please don't put your books away yet.  Okay, so that's pretty much the whole story here. But there's one more caveat. There's one more subtlety that I wanted to be clear on. Okay, which is  you can't always expect there to be a solution for it. And how much in your system even if there is for the homogeneous we know they're always is for the homogeneous one any homogeneous system has zero as a solution might have others or might have zero is a unique solution same coefficient Matrix. So here is an example here is a 3 by 3 system and it's a homogeneous system 0 is a solution of this system. But if we want to characterize the full solution set then we have to do row reduction on the homogeneous augmented Matrix, so I'm not allowed to do that for us here. Actually. We already did it.  Gyros at the bottom now from the beginning of the lecture, we know that means that ax equals B will not have a solution for some bees. There was some BS or she doesn't have a solution but equal 0 there will be a solution for a homogeneous solution. And actually there's going to be more than one because if we look at this reduced row Echelon form, we see that there's going to be a variable on the parametric solution will call x3s.  And this reduced row Echelon form here says X1 X2 X3 equals. Okay, x 1 is equal to -4/3 or x 1 - 4/3 s equal 0  An X2 is equal to zero. This is the same thing we saw before.  Right. So this is ask X the vector 4/3 zero one. So it's one parameter family.  And then we also saw that this guy here the same coefficient Matrix, but with this be on the right hand side has no solution.  Right now we can see that from the registration form of the augmented Matrix. So that's the subtlety here. I said that to find the solution of an in homogeneous system. You just take the homogeneous solution and translated by a particular Vector. You have to be able to find a particular solution for that to work. Okay, in this case, even though the homogeneous system has an infinite family collection of of Solutions in a system with that B has no solution at all. So let me just summarize that and you can read this. It's in the textbook and it's on the slides. Now. This is the theorem I'll just say quickly in the last 30 seconds out loud.  Just because the homogeneous system always has a solution doesn't mean that the corresponding in homogeneous systems with the same coefficient Matrix have any solutions that all some of them will some of them won't if they have any solutions that all they are described in this form by taking the homogeneous solution and translating it by some particular Vector, but that won't always be possible. Sometimes there's no solution at all. This is not a good computational tool if you're actually going to solve a system you always do the same thing, which is  Excellent. See you on Monday. Have a good. "
