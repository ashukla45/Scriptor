    "Full Transcript": "Happy Monday, everyone.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  So let's get going our usual reminders.  Today we're going to be doing anything for making sense of a lot of the questions that we've had the last few lectures and the next lecture on Wednesday. We're going to linear Transformations. We're going to add another level of different language and different ideas.  Some reminders your first two MyMathLab homework assignments are due tonight at 11:50 or by 11:59 p.m. So hopefully you're already mostly done those. I hope you finish the first one a week ago, since you could have finished it you could have done it in class last Friday not this past one, but the one before that so we've got everything you need to do on those assignments. MyMathLab is working. Well for most of you. I know if you working with us on Piazza and I'll be resolved enough time for you to finish the meeting the homework tonight. And by the way, you have another homework set another homework set homework 3 on MyMathLab has now been posted you can look at it and start right now if you want now this moment in class, but probably not a good use of your time. It's due next Monday.  This week. You also have Matlab homework. So it was originally due last Friday, but in order to accommodate all of the people from the waitlist that we let in on Friday nights by 11:59 p.m. That's for everybody. So if you wanted extra time to work on it, you got it this time, but the next day that is 5 days from today at 11:59 p.m.  And two more reminders first, your first midterm in this class is next week. And this is week 3 right now next week this week for your first week midterm is Wednesday evening of next week. I'll give you more details. It's going to cover everything up until Friday of this week. That is all chapter one. That's the cutoff date for material covered on the midterm.  And one final quick reminder her quick information my office hour. Tomorrow morning is shifted a little bit shifted up to 9:30. So I'll be there from 9:30 to 11 not later as usual return to the normal hours calendar, but just in case you wanted to come after 11, I won't be there this time. I'll be there from 9:30 to 11.  Alright, so let's get going on today's material.  Talking about linear Independence, and actually this is one of the many cases in mathematics where an important definition of concept is actually introduced by a negative. Okay. So really a moment, let's start with a graphical example of their I've given you three vectors vector v is a red vector and W is a green Vector just don't actually have colors. I'm just saying you can see the arrows there are different colors.  and so the question is  are those three vectors independent from each other and some sense or are they dependent on each other?  Lexington Vector w  is w a linear combination of u and v  Or not. Just to be clear. This is not a released three-dimensional projection. Look at that in a three dimensional vectors, but on the great what the coordinates are you has coordinates a 0 2 V has coordinates looks like 1 2 3 4 5 - 2 + W has coordinates 5 + 151. Okay. So the question is is w a linear combination of u and v  I heard someone say yes pretty confidently over on the side of the road. Could you tell me why?  A person disappeared would someone like to tell me why?  You could take his V and add 1.5 times you and get W. That's exactly right.  So I'm going to scale up these ones in Black. I'm going to scale-up you to 3/2 times its current height. So there's one point five times and now I'm going to take the vector v.  And as we know we're supposed to do I'm going to move it up to the tip of 1.5 times. So that shows us.  that  w  is equal to 3/2 U + be a combination of these three vectors are linearly dependent.  Which just means that there is a linear dependence between them that you can express the vector is you and that I can get the example we could write this with * 2 + 2.  and I could solve this relationship for any one of these three vectors as a combination of the other two so I could for example  I could write this one immediately as a v is equal to - 3/2 U + W. So there's V Express as a linear combination of you. Similarly. I could not see solve. This one. Here is a three you  Is equal to 2 - 2 V + 2W, which means that you is equal to -2/3 V + 2/3 W. I have solve each one of the variables as a linear combination of the others. I don't always do that with every one of the variables case. I can every one of these variables is linearly dependent on the other two.  Let me write it one more way relevant to us. Let's take this relationship right here. And let's write it like this. That's right. It is Ryu.  + 2 V - 2 W equals zero one more way to write this idea which is to say  electors have a linear dependence between them means that I can take a non-trivial linear combination of them and get 0 here is a lots of uses in common parlance, but very specific at all.  Any set of three vectors for example, and I can always make some linear combination of them 0 right? How do I add vectors in the room right direction?  I could make a linear combination of these is equal to 0 how  I heard somebody said clearly the answers multiply each one of them by zero not them up any combination of Zero by using 0 as this Corporation for every one of them has a solution. Is there a solution has The Columns of the coefficient Matrix? That's what we're saying. You can always take it always find one in this case x 1 x + 3 equals 0 such that the solution  But that's kind of a silly solution in the question is is there a non-trivial linear combination? So this and if you have a linear dependence one vector is a linear combination of a linear combination of those three vectors.  In which some maybe not all but some of the coefficients are not zero this case. All three of the coefficients are not zero, but then we say that the vectors are linearly dependent.  Another example this one I haven't drawn for dimensional vectors red and green again.  Vectors linearly dependent, is there a linear dependence between them immediately near dependents between them or not?  Well, I can't say I can because I cooked it. I know the answer but just staring at them pretty hard to express 1 as linear combination of the others. I happen to know that there is and in this case.  Notice what happens if we take - 2 * a + add 3 * B.  So the first - 2 + 9 is 7  -2 * 2 is -4 - 3 is -7 - 2 * 0 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 - 2 + 6 is 4  there is a linear combination. There is a linear relationship between these vectors - 2A + 3B is equal to C.  I could rearrange this if I like noticed that all of those coefficients are nonzero. So if I read it in the same way, I guess.  - 2A + 3B - C equals 0 there is a non-trivial linear combination of them. You can have all nonzero coefficients highlight of the sea because it's really a 1 in front of it.  Remind us when I guess.  So I can take a collection of and make a linear combination of vectors is linear combination of the others. So this collection of three vectors is not independent from each other. If I know two of them I can get the third just by taking a linear combination linear dependence.  Just rewriting exactly same thing. I just said.  A collection of actors in The some space space collection of vectors you want you to up to un thinks of some list of columns is called linearly. If you can find one of them that is in the span of the others that is if you can find one of those vectors that is a linear combination of the other two.  I'm going to go back to the previous life for a second again. So in the first case there we found graphically that W is equal to 3/2 U + v o w was in the span of you envy by take the vectors u and v over there then W is in the span of those two as linear combination combination of all of the others that was the case so I could just divide through by the coefficient in front of be for example in order to write on your combination of a  Okay, so that's linear dependence a set of vectors is linearly. At least one of them may be more than one but at least one of them of all the others.  Now if that just is not possible.  Then we call the vectors linearly independent.  Linearly independent vectors are vectors for which you cannot express any one of them.  Definition of philosophical are linearly independent. I have to show a universal statement that there's no way I can express any one of them can expressed as a linear combination of the other two, but it is a trickier notion to wrap your brain around lots of examples.  I also want to get to to a slight variation of this definition means the same thing different. Let's take the example of  my favorite example to Arms representing Ops combination of these two because the spinner is this plane here and my head is sticking up out of that flight. So my head is not in the span of these two.  Does that mean that these three vectors are linearly independent from the definition?  That statement.  Precinct  Know why not?  Oh, but if we had all yours is coefficients that doesn't tell us anything because every combination with trivial coefficient, we're looking for non-trivial linear combination, but I said that because that's the first mistake that everybody always makes thank you for making it for everybody else so they don't have to know.  Okay. See you then you said because only one factor has to be written up there linear. Independence is no one vector can be.  Okay. Well, actually I mean for the same graphical reason that's true in this case. The arm is sticking out of that plane.  Is not in Spanish.  Okay, then again this plane.  Okay, so I have at least demonstrated are Justified graphically that those three vectors are linearly independent cuz no one of those three.  But let's rewrite this in a slightly different way.  Which is actually going to make it sound harder to verify but we'll make it mathematically connect with since you've already done it easier to verify so here is an equivalent definition.  Okay. So first of all, let's look up here again linear linear dependence.  So this means  Four examples that suppose that it's the last Vector you won.  this means you for  Is equal to Sun linear combination x1u? 1 + X2 you 2 + x 303  For some crawfish insects for next to an X300 vector.  If I had given you the example the three vectors are my usual 3 +.  Okay is the zero Vector a linear combination of those guys?  Yeah, it's a linear combination.  It says X1 you 1 + X2 you 2 + X3 used 3 - you for equal zero.  So those coefficients X1 X2 X3 X3, they could all be zero, but I've got this minus one there which is not zero. So if one of those vectors is is a combination of others. Then there is a combination of the four of them. One of those coefficients is not zero.  So if one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others, then there is a non-trivial linear combination of all of them even if all persons, but that doesn't matter.  Okay, no on the other hand.  S'pose all we need.  Was that someone your combination maybe a different one medical? Why one you want + Y2.  You 2 + y 3 you 3 + y 4 U 4 is the zero vector?  And at least one of those coefficients is not zero, that's what this statement means here. At least one of those coefficients is non-zero. Meaning that there's a non-trivial linear combination. So let's say suppose that it's why to is not zero.  Well, then I can divide through by Y2. I can divided by a nonzero number. So this one says y 1 / y to x u 1 + you 2 + y 3 / y to X U 3 + y 4 / Y 2  X eu4 equals 0 and now I can solve for you, too.  so you two is equal to - y 1 / Y 2 x u 1 - y 3 / Y 2 x u 3 - y 4 / y to X you for  so what I've shown is that if I have a nonlinear combination a non-trivial linear combination of vectors the vector sum coefficient in Errol Estates why to that's not zero then I could divide and rearrange the equation to say is this  so in other words  The collection of vectors is linearly dependent vectors is linearly independent.  which is the statement that  no one vector can be expressed as linear combination of the others is the same thing as saying there is no non-trivial linear combination of all of them that gives  that's the reverse of the positive statement terms of linear dependence linear dependent is the statement that one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others. But this calculation here. This is the same thing as a combination of them is 0 kilos are equivalent statements even though statements.  And the nice thing about the second of row reduction are tools of solving linear systems in order to answer this question. Okay. So here is the theorem  we just proved there's a theorem that we just demonstrated true statements here is the true statement that we just demonstrated.  Hey, if I have vectors you once were you when they are linearly independent really independent meaning by definition. They're not linearly dependent meaning that no, one of those is a combination of the others that happens. If and only if the equation X2 + 0 has only the trivial solution.  That's what linearly independent vectors are that's what linear Independence means. It means that the only way that I can get a linear combination of those vectors equal 0 is if it's the trivial linear combination  Otherwise, it would mean are linearly dependent and that's one of them.  Okay. So this now he's sitting in terms of language that we know how to handle if I want to prove that a set of vectors is linearly independent. I have to show that that vector equation Homewood that has only the trivial solution. Remember last time we talked about trichotomy always have a solution 0 is always a solution.  In the special case where there's just one solution. That means those column vectors are linearly independent.  Okay, so that's the statement. I just translated the first into the corresponding statement for Matrix equations only if the Matrix equation ax equals 0 has only the trivial solution.  What is a statement using row reduction?  So here are three vectors of already strung them together as The Columns of a matrix answer the question are they linearly independent? This is very much the first example of an R4 I gave you.  Ask are they linearly dependent is one of them and just staring at them. We were never going to get anywhere unless I happen to tell you that I cook some up to have this particular linear dependence to figure out if The Columns of that first Matrix their 11020 1012 if those are linearly independent or not.  The Matrix equation  that Matrix x yuno x 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 equals 0  we want to solve that.  And figure out what the solution set is if the solution consists of only the zero Vector then those vectors are linearly independent if the solutions that is a parametric solution that has infinitely many solutions. Then the vectors are not linearly independent. The vectors are linearly dependent. So now we go ahead and we solve  Row reduction. Yeah, okay. I guess I'm not super excited about doing Road auction either but it's stuff. You don't it's it's a necessary tool and this one isn't going to take very long.  So we want to solve that system.  Right balls couple things I could do. I want to get zeros below the leading one. I could swap the second and third anyway.  So I'm going to subtract the first row from the second.  Hypnotize me a zero there a -2 there retains the one there and of course, it doesn't do anything for the right hand side.  Okay.  And I've already got the zero down below.  So now I want to get rid of the one below II.  Well, there's a couple of ways things I could do. I could tip it in order to get a one leaving one in the second row. Let's go ahead and do that I suppose.  That means that I get a - 1/2 here.  If you see me making America Lehrer please pointed out. I may well have made one already.  right now I want to get rid of the one below the one in the third that's going to give me the desired 0 there and I'm subtracting a half from 2, which gives me 5/2 in that entry 0 1 + 1 0  Okay know if I wanted to actually solve this system completely I would have to do a couple more information to answer the question which of the three legs of the trichotomy is it?  Somebody from this side of the room tell me.  one solution and that one solution is  Is 000000 is reduced a pivot in every row because there's no real zeros at the bottom to give us here. But only because the number of rows equals the number of columns in this case is because there are no non pivotal columns.  friends pivot no free variables  unique solution we can solve for it by pitting the last row there and then a reduction or we could do the last equation says x 3 equals 0 and the second was not going to say x 2 - 1/2 0 is 0 and so on and we know that the unique Solutions.  So once we're here, we're done. We now have unique solution.  and therefore  this implies that X1 X2 X3 is equal to 000. So what we've got is  that Matrix there has the properties that the only solution to the Matrix equation ax equals.  x equals zero from the previous page the statements  that these three vectors are linearly independent.  Okay ezpz done here in our for are they linearly independent or are they linearly dependent? Well, we already know the answer because I pulled in the first so we already know the answer would answer is going to be but let's see how our methods give us the answer. We need to carry this Matrix to row Echelon form. Technically. We need to take the augmented Matrix.  And duro operations on that. So let's do that this time.  Okay. Alright, so I need to looks like I might have a bunch of work to do but it's actually going to go real quick. So I need to get a zero.  Subtract twice the first row from the second 0 there and a -4 there.  And I - 21 there.  I've already got a zero here.  -7 - 21  Is there a problem?  Yes, there's a problem. What's the problem?  Are you telling me that?  -6 - 1 is not - 4.  Thank you.  Let's fix that.  I'm going to pretend that I made that are pedagogically for you to find you're not going to believe me, which is good first row from the third one. So I got a zero there I get to -3 is -1 + 4 - 7 is -3  Okay. Now they're a bunch of things I could do for my next step.  The standard thing is to Pivot that second row there. I can / -7 to get a leading one and I could alternatively have swap the second and third row, but those are actually give me the same results.  Because / 1 + 3 there.  Simile in the third row. I'm going to pay that by dividing through by minus one giving me a one in there and look the  so now I'm going to subtract the second row from the third and from the fourth, but when I do that  I just get all zeros down there.  Okay. I know this Matrix is the end of row Echelon form.  Let's go ahead and do one more step and take it to reduced row Echelon form.  Which only takes one more step. I just need to get rid of the three above the second-leading which means I multiply -3 and add give me the  Okay. So now we answer the question as to which we already know.  Are these vectors linearly independent or linearly dependent?  I heard some indiscernible mumbling. So let's try again by a hand. Tell me what's the answer and why yes.  is a free variable in column straight and so  Very good. I'll say everything you just said we already know this is infinitely many solutions are non-trivial solution. Look what happened here. So I told you at the beginning - 2 * the first Spectre plus three times. The second is equal to the Third.  We can pick that off of the reduced row Echelon form.  There's a -2 and a three there.  Is this form of the Matrix here? It's obvious. I hate to use that word cuz it's not always obvious until the third column is -2 times the first plus three times the second one by -2 -2 and everywhere else when you take the Matrix to reduced row Echelon form. If you have any free variables, then those columns tell you how to reconstruct that column as a linear combination of the previous ones.  So not only question that these vectors are linearly dependent.  and these coefficients tell us how  okay.  Great. Now there's one more thing. I wanted to point out here, which is that it was a waste of energy to carry all of the zeros in the right-hand column around if I could just erase them from consideration.  Nothing would have changed when you're solving a homogeneous system. There's no reason to write cuz it's never going to change operations don't change the zeros right now. Be careful if you're going to do that because it's only going to work in the case of a homogeneous system. If you have any homogeneous system, you need to carry those cuz they but in the case of the homogeneous system in particular when were answering question not linear dependence. There's no reason to write the zeros over and over. We just carry the coefficient Matrix question. If we want to know an exact linear dependence between the variables the columns.  Okay, so that's more or less the whole story on linear Independence. That's how you determine whether vectors are linearly independent. So let's look at some specific mechanical way to do it. Okay, there's some cases where we don't need to do much.  So for example suppose I give you a list of vectors and one of them is the zero Vector. We actually really already considered this case. But soon as I give you the vectors 1 3 7.  206000 factors or linearly dependent by just looking linearly independent.  Someone scratch their head in the sort of meekly that that okay, are they linearly independent? Are they linearly dependent raise your hand?  Why are they linearly dependent?  Yes.  Okay, that that's a great explanation for typical Hangouts, but it's a great explanation for why you were wrong and why is convincing to think that would be the answer answer was because 0 if you want to get zero as a linear combination of the first to the only way you can give zero is a zero Vector. That is absolutely true what that tells us. Is that the first two vectors by themselves, but I asked are those three vectors together linearly independent the answer that is no there because I can take the following linear combination of all three I can take  0 times the first  I can take  0 times the first  + 0 * II + 300 + 776 * 1/3  and that gives me the zero vector.  and the point is  that those three coefficients. They're not all 02. This was that point we we made early on in the lecture that just because when you're expressing one of the others if you can do so, but having a 14-point this is a non-trivial linear combination because at least one of those coffee  in general here the answer is that  If you ever have a list of vectors that includes the zero Vector as one of those vectors, they are always automatically linearly dependent. If you put in the zero Vector that makes them linearly dependent because you can express that zeros after a combination of all of them together to give zero at least one of them is a linear combination of the other ones non-trivial because in the case  That's it. A good Turkey Point to keep in mind as we go forward. Okay, next example. What if I just give you a list of one vector is my my one vector v. I don't care what it is.  Nearly independent or linearly dependent.  See people biting their lips, which is the right answer because what does that even mean where mathematics is much better than natural language? Because we made things precisely the point that any question can be answered. So it's hard to understand what it would mean to say one vector is independent. What but our definition was it is your oh, so that's the question here.  So is it true?  That some non linear combination non-trivial linear combination of that one vector, which is X1 if that's its is equal to zero.  for some non-zero  X1 that's the question. Can I multiply x1v buy some nonzero number X1 and get 0  yes by which which factor explains which number ATS when should I use?  Okay, so maybe that vector v there was the was the vector this one?  Hey, so let me pick any number. I'll take the number one.  Is 1 * inspector equal to the zero vector?  Your train of thought I was getting a little lost because I've negated statements great example of why these things are important to think about a lot the language gets complicated and the stately logic is complicated. So you need to run through a dozen times before you can see what the definition  Exactly. So the thank you for saying that exactly what I was going to so the answer is no if the key is not the zero Vector but yes, if the is zero vector.  So in other words if B is a nonzero Vector, it is linearly independent. There's no way you can scale a nonzero vector by a nonzero number and you can't multiply two nonzero things and get 0  the real numbers anyway  but if you started with the first example if you have any list of linearly dependent  Okay, so we're just testing our understanding of the definition of these kind of met examples here.  What is it mean to say? They are linearly independent the definition to linearly independent.  if and only if  There's some linear combination of them.  Does zero sum non-trivial linear combination?  So I can take some that some corporations X1 X2. Not both 0 it gives me 0 for those two.  Well, let's suppose that this one is a nonzero one and I can solve the one we did the example with four vectors A few minutes ago. Is it what's that minus x 2 / x 1 x V2?  That says that is a scalar multiple of V2.  If I send a text.  Is a scam.  anyone  I've heard a few people say very quietly. Someone say it louder.  Okay, maybe not louder anyone want to raise their hand until I guess they're called parallel.  I have parallel vectors. They are linearly dependent if my two vectors were one two, three seven.  and to 6 - 14  look at those and tell me are they linearly dependent or not?  That's the same as the question look at those and tell me are they parallel or not?  No, they're not parallel. Why are they not parallel? Because well I can just see when I have only two factors if I wanted to get the second one as of scalar multiple the first I know what coefficient I need to use. I need you to write so does that work for all the times 2 times 1 is too. Yep 6 * 2 is 3 - 14 so these two are not parallel and therefore they are linearly independent if they're going to plus there these would be parallel.  And therefore linearly independent is linearly dependent.  In the cases where you have only one vector only two vectors or if your list includes a zero Vector it's easy to just look at them and see if there's really no easy way to do. It is no easy way to eyeball it but there's an easy way to calculate which is to do row reduction. Okay, so I was going to do one more example here but where I would just about out of time, so I'd rather spend one more minute the one minute we have left cementing.  Cementing what we've done let's do this second example here cuz it's already done for us. So let's remind ourselves what we need to do here near the independent or not. The way I ask is the trivial solution or has non-trivial Solutions. So I've already use Matlab to compute. Does this Matrix as the coefficient Matrix hear does it represent a system with only one solution or with infinitely many solutions.  Infinitely money because this is not going to mention Matrix. This is the coefficient Matrix because that third of that Force column there.  the sports column there  has no pivot.  Has no leading entry. Therefore. There's a free variable.  therefore  there's a non-trivial solution.  And therefore these vectors are linearly dependent.  No for the last 10 seconds here computations in this example know.  four vectors in R3  What do we string them together in the coefficient matrix? It's a matrix with four columns. But only three rows and the question where the seeking to answer is is there a pivot in every column?  The can't give him in every call him cuz there is only at most one pivot per row so there can be at most 3 pivots 3 pivots. And so what we see is if you have a matrix which has more columns and rows, there's no way those columns can be linearly independent if you have columns in R3 if there's more than three of them must be linearly dependent.
