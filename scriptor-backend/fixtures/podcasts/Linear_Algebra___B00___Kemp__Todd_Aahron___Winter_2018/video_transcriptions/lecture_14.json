All of the concepts will have been covered with in this lecture Matrix inverse of you right now and in the process, it seems like  Many of you were pretty Rusty on even how to multiply matrices picture of the fields medalist alencon. What are the most famous mathematicians of the 20th and 21st century and I was exhausted and I was lost for the whole lecture in 45 minutes into an hour-long lecture and he said, okay now let's demonstrate this literally just two matrices and he messed it up three times. He didn't get it right until the 4th attempt.  Now I found this funny at the time because multiplying matrices very often. He was working on some other esoteric before the crowd and hadn't practiced.  If you don't practice was computations to the computers, you need to know how they work enough to understand how it works Matlab to do all the computations and you can make but you're going to have to make sure that you're doing and that you can begrudgingly do it when you need to cuz that's my advice.  I said I would like to continue. Basically. I'm going to start with reminder of what we did at the very end of the last lecture.  Tell us about subspaces in general and then for any particular subspaces, okay, the Subspace of the domain Associated to that Matrix beauty is a linear transformation is the null-space Matrix and the Subspace of the code as a reminder of what those things are the null space.  Is defined to be the solution set of the homogeneous system that they represent in the domain on this case.  It's Matrix is 3 by 5. That means that the domain is vectors an R5 and it's the set of vectors in R5 for which a x x equals 0.  Text me actually move that so I have a little room to compute it. So we want to we want to figure out what is the null space for this Matrix.  And the point is that that thing which we saw explicitly last day Computing proving with the simple computations put it together in the right way was it if I take two solutions of the homogeneous system and add them up that gives me a solution of the homogeneous system. That's just dishin x + 8 Y is equal to 8 * x + y Subspace in a vector space is the span of some collection of vectors and the null-space of a matrix is always going to have the form the span of some collection of vectors are combinations of some one more time goes through that computation thousands of times.  Who is coefficient Matrix is a?  So we just wrestling forum and pick off the answer from there and I have asked Matlab to do that for us. Here is the reduced row Echelon form of that Matrix a from here. We can write down the solution set.  Foot Solutions to the equation x equals 0. Okay. Looks like X1 X2 X3 X4 or X5. Well that person free variables in column is non pivotal.  What is the fourth column in the fifth column? That means that the variables x 2?  X4 and X5 are free variables. The other variables will be expressed as those variables in the solution set of the first equation translating says x 1 - 2 x 2 - x 4 + 3 equals 0 + x 4  -3 x 5 x 3 + 2 x 4 - 2 x 5 equals 0 so we subtract from the other side when we get the x 3 is equal to -2 x 4 + 2 x 5.  So there is no solution for the parametric form and then we know that it's probably easier to understand what that says.  everything x 2 x and a y v  Okay. Now that's factor out the free variable x 4 there's a 1 in the First Column first row of zero in the second minus 210.  and then x 5  is a -3 in the first row then a 0 then a two zero and one.  So that is a perfectly good description of the solution set of all vectors of the form a + 210 + another free variable x - 30201 in other words.  This is the span of those three vectors. I'll just call those vectors for now. I'll call them.  I'll cover V1 V2 and V3. Those are three factors in our five.  And what we have just identified.  Is that the null space?  of the Matrix a  That span the null space.  All right now.  I have some questions that I want. Oh actually before we answer questions, let's let's talk about the column space as well as space.  In the column space is equal to by definition the span of The Columns of a I don't want to write those down. So I'll call them A1 A2 A3 A4 and A5.  And by definition the column space is the span of those five calls.  So that's easy to write down.  I know what these subspaces are. So now let's ask some questions about them. So I've given a couple of vectors up there a vector you which is a vector in the domain the vector in r v and the vector v which is the vector in the rain.  How would we answer that question?  Row reduction. Okay, that's a perfectly good. So what that means is what I'm asking is there you in the Subspace the null-space of a which I meant it with the column you and I'm so I don't have to do it.  what I'm really asking is you and the null-space of a  that's asking.  Is a times you equal to zero?  That is an easy thing to cancer by direct competition. I just take the Matrix a and I X the column you  I don't want to go to that computation right now, but we can we can do the first entry of that. Okay, so anytime is you is going to be  Let's do it over here.  It's going to have three components on the first components.  This row X component Lies by that, So let's see if we can can do it real quick here.  I got 3 * -3 - 9.  + 6 * -2 - 12  + -1 x - 1 + 1 + something * 200 + -7 * 247 - 28  Okay. Now let's add those of -9 - 12 is -21 + 1 is -20 - 28 is  -48  now I don't need to go any further to answer this question. Whatever this Vector eight times. Did I make a mistake? It looks like I did.  Yeah, what did I write mine, but it's not sorry about that. So this First Column is a one that's a -3 there. Thanks for pointing out that that wasn't very clear. So I think what I wrote was right, so I get -48 there no matter what the other entries are. This is not the zero vector.  So that means that the answer here is no.  You is not enough space. That's much easier than doing row reduction. So the moral of the story here is if you want to figure out what the roast what the null space is for Matrix that takes work you have to do Robert option. But if you want to test membership, if you have a vector and you on an answer the question is that that's easy to check you just plug and chug on the other hand for the column space. I'm asking is the vector v in the column space so it's easy to write.  You just write it down. But if I if I have a particular what I'm asking is is V.  in here  and the only way to an option I have to take  that's tomorrow. So testing membership in the no spaces easy, but describing it as hard describing the column space is easy, but testing membership.  Describe the column space is as easy as it can get a matter of copying. What was something slightly better that you can do. Okay, that's being a little inefficient. This is a perfectly good and we're going to get to explain why so this is a perfectly fine answer but it's maybe not the most efficient answer.  So here's a question that I want to answer together as a means of testing some of the concepts that we've been discussing for the last few weeks.  So we described The North Face.  Why the homogeneous equation ax equals B. So we've got our Matrix a solution that  Hey, is that thing a Subspace question? We need to figure out whether you think this thing is a Subspace or not.  talk talk  I hear the talking. How many people?  How many people think it's not a Subspace?  Most of you how many people don't know what a Subspace is?  Nobody raised their hands, but I bet in one hand was at the back. Thank you for your honesty, sir. Okay, and I bet that at last reply to many of you is totally fine. It just means you need to be reviewing what we're doing in these letters a few more times. In fact the answer to this question.  Yes.  Okay, so you're saying zero is not a solution of x equals B. That's correct. So no zero is not NW because not equal to B is not zero the only way they could be us.  The questions is now is well, let's just check. So if x is in W, which means that?  8 * x equals B  Then let's look at 2 x 2 x 2 x is equal to 2 times. Ax200 Vector is twice itself.  So that means that is not in W and similarly with addition the same way if I have two solutions If X and Y are solutions.  10 * x + y is equal to x + 8 but in this case, we don't get 0 + 0 we get b + B which is to be  which is not speak just like above their 4 x + y is not in w o w is maximally not a Subspace. It doesn't contain zero. It's never closed scalar is one never closed under addition ever.  Okay, great. So the homogeneous solution set is really special and one way we can talk about it being special is that it's a Subspace that it's the only solution.  Great.  No, I would like to understand no spaces in column spaces and subspaces that in general better. We're getting there. So now I want to talk about generalizing some of the Notions.  from RN to General exercises in Subspace linear dependence and we talked about that for  colon doctors in RN but ideas that we develop their had nothing in particular to do with RN the only required that we lived in a vector space the only required that we knew how to add scalar multiply the vectors. So I'm going to write down the definitions again factors might not be there General in a vector space space of matrices.  we call them a linearly dependent if  one of them at least one of them.  Is a scalar multiple linear combination?  of the others  exactly definition for linear dependence  and we saw and they same proof we gave in that lecture. We saw the that can be stated as  there is  a non-trivial  linear combination  of them  equaling 0 x 1 x 2  oops  up to xn  nonzero coefficients  that is not all of your accomplishments. So X1 like this.  The vector x 1 through 10 is not the zero vector.  But give the zero Vector same definition as before linear dependence means that there is a linear dependence relation between them. There's some non turn a trivia linear combination equivalently since one of those coefficients at least is not one of the vectors is going to be a linear combination of the others.  I'm so then we have the negative of this property as well. We call vectors those vectors in this Vector space linearly linearly dependent and then just reversing the second definition taking the negation of the second definition. That means there is no non-trivial linear combination equals 0.  There is no non-trivial.  linear combination  How does electricity Quintero we know that there is a linear combination sequence you can always take.  What linear Independence means is that? That's the only way to get zero here in other words?  if you have x 1 V 1 + x 2 V 2 + ZN  equal 0 the only way that could have happened if all of the coefficients.  r0  okay, that's what linear dependence mean or linear Independence means the only way to get zero.  So let's look an example to submit that this is something you seen before but you might need new language or you might need a new level of abstraction to applied in cases where the vectors are not calling anymore. So for example, here are three polynomials.  X + 1 squared x squared + x + 1/2 in the vector space of polynomials of all polynomials. So here's the question.  So the question is is there a non-trivial linear combination of these guys that gives the zero polynomial?  Would you like to explain why?  Okay, you want to give the names? Let's give him names and you're telling me that one of you want minus V2.  -2 equals that's cracked. Let's just work it out if I squared.  I can I know how to how to expand a polynomial x squared plus 2X + 1  And that is x squared + 2 * x + 1/2.  And look what that says. I've got here if you want.  Hear V2 and hear B3 in other words V1 - V2 - 2 V 3 equals 0 there is a non-trivial linear combination of vectors are linearly dependent.  Yes.  You think what's right?  They aren't scalars. They are scalar value functions. They are polynomials. So for each fix text to just three numbers 3 numbers are linearly dependent because they're one-by-one vectors and one-by-one vectors. There can be at most one linearly independent one, but those aren't that you tell you about the polynomial which is the function which takes x + x + 1 square that is not a scalar number. It is a function and it is out of the question on almost everybody's mind the first time second time and third time they see this the other question is common stock Natural Things To Think.  These are abstract basic objects. The vectors polynomials themselves. Okay, but you're absolutely right. You need to be careful.  And think about these things not as numbers when you just plug in some value of x and in particular, it's really important that when you find if you're near a dependent you want to find a linear combination of them that gives hero that linear combination has to have an X in it.  Right, so I could stay here to polynomials x squared and execute like a linearly dependent because excuse that X is just a number so that parallel they're not parallel. I didn't * a number.  Okay, so when you find a linear dependence if you're looking for one between some polynomials the numbers you're looking for have to be just scalar numbers not polynomials. Morale is their functions and those are the outside factors of this space.  I hope that that clarified things a bit, but if it didn't go back and do more examples from the book. This is a critical point that we need to understand not only talk to a sense of critical that we need to understand.  Okay, so that's linear dependence and linear Independence in an abstract Vector space.  I want to talk about.  Efficiently describing subspaces, if that's the byline that I'm giving here for at this new notion were going to introduce now, which is when the most important oceans in Albany or else you're probably the most important.  So, how do I describe a Subspace what's so far every Subspace that we have encountered was either explicitly given as or could be of some set of vectors. So that's a nice efficient way to describe every Subspace is the span of some particular set of vectors for many.  the question is  Is every set of vectors that spans the Subspace just as good as any other?  Or are there more efficient and less efficient ways to describe it.  I can sometimes remove some of the factors that I'm using to describe an example of the plane passing through my arms in space here and suppose that I have a serious neck injury in my head is in the plane as well.  So I have those three vectors now. I can describe that plane as the span of my arms and my head is the set of linear combinations of my two arms at my head.  But it's also just equal to the span of my two arms.  Just equal to the span of my left arm in my head.  Or just equal to the span of my right arm on my head. Okay. So those are three different descriptions of That Subspace four of them actors in the same space.  so what was going on there in that example, the three vectors are in the space and they span the space but  Any one of those factors is a linear combination of the other two.  So there was no reason to included in a description of the space as fan by such and such factors because it was already in the span of the other two.  So that means if you want to be more efficient with which means I want to throw away any accommodations of the others.  Now we have this definition that we've been working at the long time nearly dependent if at least one of them is a linear combination of the others and we want to have a description of a Subspace in which the set that spans. It is linearly independent.  And that is what basis is give you a Subspace for your tuition purposes right now. It's fine always to think of you and the Subspace is going to be some smaller dimensional Subspace inside out like a plane in R3 is a collection of vectors with two properties.  They span.  The Subspace they said they are at the kind of vectors we can use to describe it as it runs around that we don't need in that description. So we want  Is linearly independent?  So it's a linearly independent spanning set for the Subspace or if you want to use it. So catchy phrase It's a minimal spanning set. That is we don't have any extra ones hanging around that weren't really needed.  So that's what a basis is. It's a set of vector space.  But also are linearly independent. So for example  And the preeminent example if your Subspace is is that we've been working with since the beginning the standard basis vectors.  Okay, that's why they're called basis vectors.  Is a linear combination of those guys? Okay in the sort of quote on quote obvious way that the vector X1 X2 X3 Etc is presented as a combination of RN, but they're also linearly independent. How do we check that?  row reduction  we check it by row reduction.  but we need to check that the  Matrix with those vectors as columns  What do we need to check?  To see that those vectors are linearly independent. What's the what's the key feature?  But every column is pivotal.  We want to check that never call him. Well, this Matrix is already reduced row Echelon form. It's the identity Matrix. So we have therefore it forms the basis for RN.  And speaking of all sorts of other words and descriptions that we've learned are connected. So here if we're talking about a basis for RN. Okay, then we need to have a set of vectors that spans RN and that also is linearly independent now, I can check both of those things by taking the column vectors and putting them together in a matrix. If I take the columns of a matrix and I asked does that set of columns fan all of our end? What do I need to check in The Matrix?  But every row is pivotal, so if I want a set of vectors in RN to be a spanning set for RN, I need to check that every rose pivotal.  So to check that a set of vectors in RN is a spanning set for to check that it's linearly independent that you need to check that every column is pivotal. So in other words  If I have some vectors V1 up to the end.  That's a bassist.  for RN  that's going to happen. If and only if the Matrix.  Whose columns are those vectors has every row and every column pivotal?  In terms of what we did last week. What does that say about the Matrix? It says that it's invertible.  So that's another way to check here if you want to see if your column vectors are given in RNR a basis for RN in particular that tells you something about the size of a basis of RN.  Invertible matrices must be square.  And that's just because if you want to have every row and every column pivotal, then you can't have any more rows and columns or any more columns and rows.  So what we see here is that every basis of RN has n vectors in it here is one basis of our at the standard basis, but there are zillions of Eddie invertible matrix. It's called basis of RN meaning that they've spent all of our end and those bastards are linearly independent. And what are you is it says that not only is a combination of those columns.  What is a linear combination in a unique way? There's exactly one linear combination of those if you want there to be a unique solution that Matrix a better have every column pivotal. Otherwise, I'll be free variables.  All right. So that's the notion of basis a basis is a minimal spanning set that connects to a million other things that we already know how to check which always for RN.  It's so cute. This one here. Is this collection of vectors A basis for RN?  How do I check?  rubber ducks  Actually, I was thinking of asking for a volunteer.  Anyone brave enough to try anyone dumb enough to try.  I see some people trying to volunteer their their friends.  Next time you'll think twice before trying to get your friend to raise his hand.  Okay, why don't you take us through the rubber ducks in here?  You don't have to write parallel hold this for you to have to write the statement. You don't have to write two operations. Just  so tell us what's the first thing you're going to do. I'm going to double the first row and then added to the third row perfect.  rewrite the first  What is right you guys right?  Okay right now, what's the next step?  All add together those the bottom to thank you.  So that'll be like at 1:02.  I mean so we were in a bit. Okay, so you can stop.  That was great. Thank you on form that every row and every column here is pivotal. This one is this is an invertible Matrix and the answer is yes all columns and all Rose pivotal.  Awesome. Okay. So this down here this what we said if you're looking for a basis of RN.  Because the Matrix the composed of those columns must be a square Matrix invertible for a pivot in every row and every column.  And in particular kind of set of those vectors is the basis of RN.  What about a basis of a Subspace of our in here is a Subspace of R3. I've described it up there. It's like the last of us. So here's a Subspace Adventures of our streets of Subspace consisting of vectors of the form a + b a - b into a question. Is that even a Subspace? Okay. Well, we could go ahead and check directly from the definition of a fact which is that if we do our usual sort of decomposition.  + B * 1 - 1 1  i-110. Thank you.  Did you want to come down here? Maybe you do and you probably do a better job than I'm doing right now. Okay, there we go. Thank you.  Maybe you really should come down here.  so  I have a  so 80 x 1 1/2  end times 1 - 1 0  I am free.  Okay, great. Thank you.  I totally did.  Okay, so it's a set of vectors of that form explicit by Britain over there.  okay, so for free we get the  The question is is it a basis that how do I check if it's a basis? What's the  somebody from this side of the room you fight folks over here if I have a spending set by definition. What does it mean for it to be a basis?  What was the definition we gave two sides of a basis is a Spanish that is.  That is linear combinations. Well, that's what Hispanics that means. So use the wrong word supposed to be linearly.  Independence  So a basis is a linearly independent spending set. So what I need to do is check.  are these  linearly independent  I know when I have two vectors in RN, how do I check if they are linearly independent?  I got a lot of people saying row reduction that's good. That's always the best General answer. But if there's only two of them it's easy to eyeball, right because for two vectors linear Independence means that they are parallel but they're not parallel are these two vectors parallel. The first factor is not the second. So these are yes, these are linearly independent and therefore this is a basis.  Okay. Now let's look down here. Here is another set of vectors.  Is it a basis of w or not?  What's 10 spend 15 seconds?  Okay.  One confident guy also, maybe too many people think that it's not a basis almost everybody. That's correct. It's not a basis with someone from this side of the room like to explain why it's not a basis.  Answers know what someone from the middle of the room like to explain why it's a base. Not a basis. Yes.  When you add the first two vectors, you get the third one, correct? That means that those three vectors are linearly dependent this plus this equals this know they're linearly dependent.  Great know to be clear. They still are a spanning set include those two vectors.  That we already saw the standing set. That was a basis. In fact, that was a linear combination of if you have a basis already space is going to kill it being a basis because any more vectors by definition of basis will be a linear combination. Is it a bassist?  No, I heard a lot of people saying no, that's correct. It's not a basis. In fact, it's even worse this year is not in w.  And we can check that. I mean the way of any vector.  In the Subspace W that's equal to 2 a so if 2 a.m. In equal 0 that means a has to be zero, but the second component has a mind that will only Vector in the Subspace that has zeros in the second two components must have a zero in the first component to 0 + 0. This is the first base inspector of Arthur is not in WW2 the definition of a of a basis that I want to highlight with this example vectors in H.  Vectors to form a basis they have to be in the Subspace to start with doesn't even make sense to ask. This one is not a basis. It's not even a set of vectors in the space.  Okay.  so  I think we're going to we're going to stop there for today. We will continue next day talking about for a few minutes before moving on to the notion of Dimension. Have a great weekend. Make sure you get your Matlab homework is completely uploaded in the end on time this evening.  Play to play. "
