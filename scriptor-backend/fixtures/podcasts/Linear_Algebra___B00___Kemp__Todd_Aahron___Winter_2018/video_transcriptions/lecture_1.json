    "Full Transcript": "All right, we're going to get started. Hello and welcome to math 18 linear algebra the most important course, you will take this year. Possibly the most important CSD exaggerations, and I hope you will agree by the end of this week. But that is true. I think there might have hurt in but please try to come down for now sit in the Isles of the can without locking here facilities has been notified about the back could please lock the door. Okay, so we're going to be over capacity for a while. There are a hundred people on the waitlist for this class. Unfortunately, I will not be able to let everyone know some of you who are on the waitlist will get in until that's all settled by the end of week. Please try to arrive early. I guess if you want to I can save for now.  So this is linear algebra the first 20 minutes going through administrative matters for the class before we Dive Right In.  So first of all, there's a textbook linear algebra and its applications. That's the only difference between them.  It is available at the bookstore. It's also available on Amazon for substantially less money more expensive store for the following reason. We're going to be using online homework system. You need an access code comes bundled with an access code. So you will have an access code is an access code separately because if you simply purchase access code directly from the movie set up later this afternoon. The price is very low 6999 and that comes with a copy of the e-textbook if you are, okay.  But have just the e-textbook on your laptop or iPad or whatever. If you really feel that you want a hard copy of it in the book store that comes bundled with the access code and I will tell you a little bit more about how the MyMathLab system works when we get there. Okay, let's get that right now. So we'll be using this webpage this webpage as their main portal for the course here are links to everything you need. By the way. This is lecture b00. I'm also teaching lectures 200 and through the material exactly the same homework, you will have common exams at the same time. So you all three of these letters will be treated as a single lecture.  What that means is that is you will get in this room will take the same exams and you actually get in the class may be the most important Point. Anyway, we'll be using trig only for two purposes. I won't be able to tell you everything today. There will be a link on the right-hand side that says my lab.  And you will click on their MyMathLab the first time it will prompt you to create an account. When you create an account, you will either enter the access code that you purchased from the bookstore or you will purchase an access code right then then you'll have access to the online homework system if you are and you are not sure if you were going to go there is a 14 days free Grace. Wait until you know, you're in the class before you have to pay for it.  So let me talk a little bit about the homework in this class is one of only three kinds of questions from the exercises in the relevant sections. Okay, but they are online so you will be able to submit them online and getting some feedback from you have a problem suggest what you might want to do differently and you'll try again generate a new problem in the same style that you can do. This is a very useful type.  Which is why I like using it. So that's the main homework for this class. There are also going to be homework assignments topics that are a little harder to implement automatic online grading for those problems are not going to be for you to turn in. So if you don't do them and I strongly recommend that you work some of them here on this page, but without come to my office hours are UPS office hours and discuss them with us. Those are going to be important, but I'm online online system.  When does the third kind of homework in this class not lab assignments? Okay pieces of software for doing computations with matrices and linear algebra courses about there are five Matlab assignments that you were the first one so you should take a look at it right away that portion of the course is largely about teaching you how to use Matlab with how to use Matlab. You will learn Concepts in Ulster what you're learning in this room final quiz at the ends to test your attention of of Matlab concept.  So those are the three kinds of homework in this class MyMathLab online homework sets will typically be due every Monday by 11:59 p.m. They section is the first one will be not this coming Monday a week from tonight, but the following also be due that day. I'm just getting an extra week for you guys to get settled into the online system in until next week to start homework when you should start it as soon as you can see by this afternoon or tomorrow at the earliest. We're working on that homework.  There will be there already scheduled down or on February 1st and March 1st or January 31st, and they will be held at 8 p.m. Not in this room actually in different rooms for the two different exams.  They are listed as to our exams. They are not 1 hour exams, but you cannot suspend after 2 hours working on them.  Are you guys I hate exams absolutely hate them and they don't test what we want test. Anyway, I don't want to test how good you are at working fast Under Pressure. I want to test that you understand what we've been doing in the truck. So I'm going to design an exam which I expect will take less than 1 hour to finish that you could finish but I'm going to give you up. We'll take off all the time pressure that you might feel to get it done. I wish I could give you six hours for the final. I don't have the authority to do that and you might have otherwise expected that the final exam and midterm exams schedules are if you know now that you cannot make it to the final exam you should not be registered in this class is just no way around that. Okay with the midterm.  Grading scheme using an online tool that can demonstrate for you without internet, but you will on your on your phones or your computer at home and online Forum called Piazza use Piazza for vast majority. That's great that you can call me. I can see it for the whole class to see you can choose to post anonymously so that might feel embarrassed to post because there are no dumb questions within reason most of the time if you have a question that you're confused about their probably 14 to 20 other people in this room.  Exact same thing because so it will just be me and you answering each other's questions so much better for your learning AI answering your questions as well. But it's just a big collaboration. Please do not post Exact Solutions on 1st and appoints that one of your mix.  In particular just don't send me e-mail guys. Okay. Any question that you might have anyone else in this room might also be interested in sex. If you have some emergency that you need me to help you deal with rescheduling something because of the other personal emergency. Okay. Send me an email or logistics for the course posted on Piazza communication tool this quarter.  All right. So I just said we're going between all through these lectures as one big units are Ashwini Nayak Rose Elliott Smith and their office hours when they've chosen them and you're going to see them here on this Google Calendar, which will be kept up-to-date. So here you see we're all I have office hours on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. To our blocks house went on the quest webpage as well. But this is where you should look for office hours and later this week.  Okay, and then I strongly recommend that you carefully read this whole webpage once all this calendar lists all of the top for the course that we're going to run through from the textbook. We're not going to read through the text book and linear order. Okay. We're going to be jumping around a little bit in particular. You should look at it.  So you should see you see today. We're going to be doing section 1.1 tomorrow on Friday.  By Wednesday's lecture you should have read through all of those sections and maybe the next one that we're going to cover as well. That doesn't mean you should read them and you probably don't need to be in this room. But rather the most important thing you can do is read the section and figure out what it is that you don't understand out of this lecture come to the point that I need to understand and hopefully about to read ahead in order to keep up with what we're doing.  Okay, so here's some more detail about the homework that I already discussed.  Now let's talk about the grading scheme.  Practice two things I want to talk about in the grading scheme to actual letter grade scale in a final exam in those are going to be used to determine your final grade in the class. So 5% of your grade will be determined by the Matlab homework assignments. They're five each of them and a 5% from the Matlab quiz at the end and then there's also the MyMathLab online homework and that counts for 10% have any drop lowest score policy has to do them all and there is a no late homework absolute policy. Okay, if you cannot turn in late homework, it just won't be accepted. That is for the MyMathLab the way it's set up is  Every problem that you successfully finished before the deadline, but there's a week-long Grace. After the deadline unable to solve before the deadline, but during that week off of it up to 50% credit and the final exam and then there are two possible accounts for 20% of your final grade final exam counts for 40% Your best midterm counts are 20% and the remaining 60% on the final exam higher score in the at. You don't have to play some sort of gambling. I will choose for you and I will choose whichever one of these can get you the highest score the purpose of this difference between  Give you an opportunity to miss a midterm. If you absolutely have an emergency very ill and you just cannot write one of the midterms. Then you will be graded. According to the Second Skin. Okay, and you won't necessarily suffer any consequences for missing that you should not use this as an excuse for not doing the midterms if that would be a mistake. But that's what that policy is there for. There are the weight of the grades from that Metro will be transferred onto the final exam.  I should mention as a standard policy in all math courses at UCSD. You have to pass the final exam to pass the course no matter what as well as the guaranteed scale for the course. So when I say guaranteed what that means is that your letter grade will be determined by these cutoff for better. So if you get 82 as your final combined score, you will be guaranteed to get at least a B minus maybe get a beer even though the whole class does maybe I accidentally made a midterm. That was way too hard on the scores were all too. I will compensate for that for that if that happens. Okay, but you will not get the mean by the scale is guaranteed in particular if you get at least 70%  Whether or not the country past cutoff is lower than that will depend on on how things go and how you all do.  So that's the grading scheme for the class and then let me finish by mentioning a few more things administrative leave. First of all, I hear is my standards feel on academic integrity, and I've just that you read over carefully and also read the UCSD code of context code of academic integrity.  The usual issues revolve around academic dishonesty revolver on cheating. I'm sure that no one in this room is thinking of cheating for Cheating in this University are very harsh for good reason. If you are found responsible for cheating on a midterm exam suspended and very likely expelled. Those are the typical administrative punishments for cheating on exam but none of you are thinking about giving credit where credit is due on your list. I need to list who you worked with.  Okay, and then I have a list of common courtesies are things if you come in late or if you have to leave early for an appointment just as quietly as possible, please and no electronic devices of any kind that are unrelated to the course are allowed in here. So that is to say if you are following along great, please don't be watching a movie. If you feel the need to do that then if you're not here to 100% of your attention to the lecture then please appreciate it.  Okay, there will be no electronic devices of any kind of loud on the exams calculators about testing testing how well you understand the times more accurately and faster. Okay, but we need to understand how they work a little bit of whole number or maybe fractional arithmetic now and again, it's mostly about demonstrating you understand Concepts.  One thing I will say that I mentioned earlier is it allowed to bring a note seats eight and a half by 11 sheet of yourself beforehand.  Preparing that sheet of notes is a great way to start the studying process, right everything that was done in lecture into Point font on this page magnifying glass to try to find it. That's not going to help the process of distilling what you've learned into material that can fit in the best way to study the concepts. You can bring okay, but no electronic devices are allowed. Let me mention that if you require accommodations because of a disability for the last thing you need to go if you haven't already to the office for a letter and bring that to me by the end of this week.  Requires of course, but please do that. There are a number of resources page here. At least the important vocabulary terms from the entire course understand every single turn on that page before the final exam is Sommore general math and linear algebra resources there for you to take a look under such as resources section series that will be presented as the Court's proceedings that everybody is welcome to go to ask the instructor.  My name is songs for this course. I will hold 350 minutes per week on this lecture. So whatever happens in the Monday lectures, I'll cover that in the like first SI session. How do contacts work.  I will be here. I'll probably write the schedule on the board also be online.  Okay. Thank you very much.  So that's why there are a few other resources that are listed there that you could also take advantage of take advantage of as many of them as you think are necessary for you.  One more thing I mentioned before we finally get into course material actually have internet now from the iPad and what that means is that you will be able to find the lectures for this course online afterward. So let me actually real of this page now that I think I have internet and you'll see here at the bottom of the web page is going to be listed for sure. I will post these slots the same as for the other one is math 18 lecture b00 and here is a copy of a PDF file of the slides the skeleton odds for today's lecture that will get to in just a moment and you can look at that you can download  The Oscar notes for we can find them online. So you may not have to take notes. But all that is going to be there for you before and after you can also go to podcast that you see and hear the podcast for this class every lecture after it happens. Okay, so if you have to miss a class or if you want to go through it again, you can go there and see if you can go through it at a faster speed as well spend a whole 50 minutes review reviews.  Your first discussion sections will happen this coming Thursday wanted to say administratively. Are there any quick questions before we started to the course material?  Okay, great. So let's go ahead and start the course is linear algebra most important course that you will take this year and possibly during your whole career know why is that for a number of reasons? First of all, if you are the tools ideas and techniques that you will learn in this room will be fundamental to every single course that you take in your major from here on out.  Okay, so that's one possible reason why this course is very important, but there's also a bigger reason.  Which is why it's important to all of those courses which linear algebra underlies everything.  linear algebra linear equations  Thanks and what that means we will interpret okay, but all physical systems that we work with in the world not linear systems by one of the basic tenets of mathematics and science is that all systems are that we are approximately okay. And so we work with linear approximation to those systems that we can actually solve and then use that to approximate understand what's going on across the Spectrum. That's what science does and so if you want to send everything that happens in this room  What other important or a computer?  Big probably a few of you.  Your phone or computer has many processors in it. Okay to have four or eight of them plus the video processor. Your phone has at least one and one of each kind of processor is doing all day literally all computers can do you can use those operations and build from there to build logic circuits and logic gates in order to construct. The architecture of modern computers is another example build from there doing all sorts of important stuff is just really fun. At least I think so and I hope to convince you of that.  Stop be pretty ambitious though next time a reminder that you should be reading ahead before the next lecture what we're going to be doing in that lecture and at the bottom I'll give you a reminders about what are some upcoming MyMathLab Pearson online homework set is do not next Monday, but the Monday after but you should think about it as if it were due this coming Monday and hopefully it's possible to do the same day and your first next Friday.  Alright, so let us starts what is linear algebra all about? It's about solving systems of equations like this next to  In the state for some subtleties in different kinds of behavior that might happen.  In the cases to announce. What's 3 as well as it is possible to think about me that first equation this one here.  I've two variables X1 X2 and they satisfy the equation x  Now we should remember from high school that that is the equation of a line in the Cartesian plane. So what line is so if I said X1 equal to 0 then that says - 2 x 2 equals -1 x 2 equals 1/2. So the point 0 and 1/2 is on that line. And then if I let x equal 0 equals -1 I just drop at the straight lines throughout that wasn't very good.  I do the same thing as equal to that point.  And if I said x 2 x 1 equals -3 and so if I draw a straight line connecting those two points, I got that.  Equations describe those two lines or some points in the plane that are on both of those lines looking for the intersection of those two lines and clearly a single point right there in high school class was to do back substitution so I can take one and I can take equation solving for x 1 in terms of x 2.  What does x 1 is equal to 2 x 2 - 1?  Okay. Now this is a new equation.  And there's no new information by doing that. Okay. So if I if I only had equations 1 and 3 they say the same thing, but now I could take equation 2 and 3 together.  Then I have two equations for x one. So I'll substitute in the value for x one that I got an equation into equation 2 + -2 x 2 - 1  + 3 x 2  equals 3 and now I can solve that for X2. It's just a single linear equation for a single variable x 2 - 2 x 2 + 1 + 3 x 2 equals 3  So if I simplify 2 - 2 x 2 + 3 x 2 that just give me a single copy of X2 + x 2 + 1 equals 3 subtract the one from both sides and I get a coordinate has to be to not what it looks like in the picture and then I can now back substitute that into one of the two equations. For example, this one here is equal to 2 * x 2 which is to  -1 - 1 or 3 so the value of X1 have a unique solution.  Which is the point x 1 x 2 is equal to x 1 is 3 and x 2 is 2.  Okay. Now that's not the only or best way to solve them but the four-week discuss alternate methods. Let's look at a related System of a Down here. Okay. So here is a different system of equations. Actually. The first equation is the same. This is the same equation we had before but the second equation there is not the same as equation to one of the number in front of x to the coefficient of prime.  Different system of equations. So actually let's think about it for a second geometrically. This is a system of two equations in two unknowns one of those lines. We've already drawn up above. Okay, so it's this wine here.  That's the first line they're given by the equation 1.  An equation to what is what is that equation say, well, we could plus one equals zero now that gives me x 2 is equal to 3/2.  Okay, so that's here. And when x equals zero that tells me something interesting. But if you actually drive carefully you'll see each of them has a slope of 1/2.  And they're parallel which means they never intersect. I try to solve the system of equations. I will not find a solution.  And so for example, let's try to do the back substitution method like before so here I can solve and say alright first equation as before.  Is equal to 2x to -6?  Is equal to 2x to -1 enough I substitute that into equation to Prime that says that the negative of 2 x 2 - 1 + 2 x 2 equals 3.  If I simplify that says -2 x 2 + 1 + 2 x 2 equals 3 another 2 x 2 and give me the equation 1 equals 3.  Oh, that is not true.  And that's the sort of thing that will see happen. If you have two equations for two parallel lines and you try to stall some you'll arrive at a contradiction, which is this to tell you that there are no Solutions.  Okay, so here are two fundamentally different kinds of behaviors we can have for the solution set of a system of equations. There could be a unique solution or there could be no solution. There's still a third possibility as well hear. This had been 1 what is the equation of 10 - x 1 + 2 x 2 equals -1  Well, then if you think about it a little bit for the same line this line right here, every point on that line is a solution for those two equations vocabulary for these ideas of several five equations only as much information as there are in three independent equations starting next day, but now we see three at least three totally different kinds of behavior that we can get from the solution sets.  Before we do I want to talk about a different way. I mean calculation back substitution is actually a perfectly fine method for solving small systems of equation for larger system. That scales are sometimes called a better description of a row reduction.  We're going to say that phrase row reduction 450 x this quarter is almost every question in one form or another. So the idea here is if I want to multiply equations by different and add and subtract them from each other.  You can change the equations as long as you preserve the equals. So any operations that we care to do that preserves equal signs will not make it easier to figure out what the solution is.  For example the first system. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take these two equations and add them together add the stuff on the left right before an equal sign between them. And the reason why - X1 is together. I get a zero.  And then - 2 x 2 + 3 x 2 is + x 2 equals -1 + 3 is 2 but with approximately one-sixth the right is this was definitely a more efficient way to get the solution for 4X to this point. I could do the back substitution method again, that's just as efficient or I could try.  So what I'm going to do is well, I've got my new equations.  This second equation with the new one that I produced there. So that before I had the equations 1 and 2 I producing equations and now I'm going to replace the system I had before with this new system where equation one stays the same and equation to is just x 2 equals to  There's no harm in doing that. It carries the same information that the previous system. Did I want to eliminate their I want to eliminate you from this business.  Not if I just add these equations together, that's not going to work because in the first equation - so what should I do?  And it sucks.  Multiply the bottom equation by 2. So I'm going to do another transformation of this. I'm going to replace the system.  Buy one where I multiply the second equation by 2.  Is the same information as before? I know I'll add those two together.  And I get X1 plus 0 equals 4 minus 1, which is 3 and look I've solved my system.  And I wrote more than I needed to hear in order to get to that point it was before.  Know if I did the same thing with this.  Okay, I want to try to solve this system which we sell represents two parallel lines that don't intersect. If I add these two up 0 plus 0 equals two and I arrive at a contribution Solutions.  Okay.  row operations that we're doing really well larger systems of equations and we'll spend the last 5 minutes attempting one of those to see what I mean, but before we get there, so let me mention a little bit of vocabulary now to talk about the things that we three things typically that can happen if there are some solutions  Okay, we call the system consistent.  It's a consistent system of equations. Meaning they are solvable you might also say there's no solution will call them inconsistent.  Also in this process here on the last page where we took a system of equations operations consisting of new equations, but that we got from operations. Okay, if we called let's to the old one.  So equivalent means we got them from the old one by doing legal operations by preserving the equal signs and that's going to preserve the solution set.  Okay, so we have three different situations we could be in either. There's no solution inconsistent system in which case that's what we saw in the example that we've looked at so far, but it turns out that's totally Universal. Those are the three possibilities. No Solutions one solution or infinitely many solutions. Just the way that linear algebra Works in nonlinear algebra one or infinitely many solutions.  Okay, so finish off.  Let's now look at a larger system of equation three equations in three unknowns.  Hey, we could interpret it as the cyst as a system of three equations in three unknowns represents three planes.  Okay, so that's the first equation is the equation of some plane in three dimensional space looking at whether those three planes intersect some point that is on all three planes. Maybe there are many points has maybe there are not look at the corner of the room down here. Okay. So the floor is a plane. This wall is a plane.  And that corner is the unique solution of that system of three equations on all three of those plants are three more plants the floor and the ceiling.  Those are three planes and that is inconsistent. There's no point that is on all three of those points.  Is another system of equations?  The wall here.  This wall here.  And the plane that comes up perpendicularly here that you can't see.  Those are three planes and they have infinitely many solutions to that system. This whole line here is on all three of those plans of that fan-like shape.  Can have all three of those possibilities we can have no solution one solution or infinitely many solutions. How do we find the solutions follow the same procedure as before which is to add 5 minutes to the first equation there has an X1 and the last equation has a 5x what I'm going to do.  by -5  That's the most play Everything by -5 in equation.  I know if I put that together with the last equation.  an atom up  those cancel and I get an equation which says 10 x 2 - -10x equals.  I haven't got any closer at least on first inspection to solve an equation if I replace this.  That I still have three equations none of which is solved. But now I have two equations that have  I know I could do what I did on the last slide and 30 seconds me point out that a whole lot of writing and there's no real good reason for me to do all of that writing if I stay in formation that was contained in this system is contained in this Matrix. A matrix is just an array of numbers and here I have the coefficients from the system of equations on the left and the solution on the right. That's what they were equal to on the right.  Please do not pick up your bags. I'm not done and a lot of you are going to want to please be courteous to your neighbors.  Just to show you exactly one here. That's was Row 3 in this Matrix operation that we just did on the last slide.  was  we took  -5 * Row 1  We added it to roast and put the result in Row 3 need to have the X1 X2 and X3 around in order to operation.  Right. I just said I take row One X through by -5 and add it to Row 3 that gives me -5 + 5 which is 0  10 + 10  + - 5 - 5 which is -10  + 0 + 10 which is 10 carry over the same numbers that I had before what we just did is a typical example of a row operation and it carries the same information that was in the second system of equations there with a whole lot less writing. There's no reason to carry that X1 X2 X3 operation. As long as you do these valid row operations, that's exactly what you're doing. Wednesday's lecture on is making sure what are they using them with the matrices and not writing the X1 X2 X3. "
