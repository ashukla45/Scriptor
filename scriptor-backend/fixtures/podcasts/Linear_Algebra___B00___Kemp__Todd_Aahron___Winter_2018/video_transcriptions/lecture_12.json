This Friday you have a Matlab assignment on Friday, February 9th at 11:59 p.m. And also your fourth MyMathLab homework is due a week from today Monday, February 12th at 11:59 p.m. On there's one more thing. I wanted to mention which is that my office hours.  Are shifted this week?  so my office hour  will be  Wednesday and Friday  1 p.m. To 3 p.m. This week's is my usual office hour is Friday at 1 p.m. And I'm going to actually have to shift my Tuesday off Wednesday. I will be on campus tomorrow. Okay, so that's why my office hours are this week.  All right, so I would like to get started with what we're doing today, but getting started Meals Review everything we did last day in versus things that sometimes exist. If we have a matrix if it has a two-sided inverse that is if there is a matrix see if i x c x a I guess the identity matrix. It's possible to hook up one of these to happen, but the other can fail, okay, because matrix multiplication really does not commute in general. So we want it to be a two-sided inverse. We saw that  Having a left inverse assis the c x a is the identity Solutions Section 8 x solution, but it might not be unique. So if you wants to have a unique ax equals and respect you need to have the sea on both sides and then we call it a inverse ace to the power of -1 and that's just because of these statements every Square Matrix is invertible. That's definitely not true. But every invertible Matrix is square.  And we saw various equivalent conditions to check if a matrix is invertible. It's invertible. If and only if it's reduced row Echelon form is the identity Matrix, which is the same thing as saying that all rows and columns are pivotal, but because it's a square Matrix, you only need to check one of those right if if every row Matrix that means there are and pivots but there can only be one pivot per column as well actually all the columns and vice-versa every column pivotal is the same thing as it's not true of rectangular matrices, but it is true for square matrices. So if you got a matrix and you know that it's Square then it's invertible. If and only if it has n fitbit's a pivot for each row and he's column. Okay, and that's the same thing as it's reduced row Echelon form being the identity Matrix and then taking that same converting it into equivalent Notions that we've been developing.  The same statement tells you that a is invertible. If and only if The Columns of a are linearly independent and dependent are all pivotal. That means that the columns span all of our end.  And for a square Matrix just because several rows into columns go hand-in-hand for square Matrix those two are equivalent to a dependent. If and only if they spend all of our end now all that is to say those are conditions. We can check any one of them to see if the Matrix is invertible if we actually want to find the inverse as we saw last time this multi augmented Matrix system of equations will take the Matrix and we put another Square Matrix to the right of it by 2 and Matrix.  And we carry it to register a salon form that whole big augmented Matrix again for your convenience Matrix doing the same row operations. You would do no matter what but you if you know that a is invertible then what's going to happen is you're going to go left four columns in that case are going to be the reduced row Echelon form of a and the senior left with on the right is the inverse of a  Now let me comment by the way. Someone posted a good question on Piazza this morning where they did they did this with a matrix that was equal to and then the inverse was a matrix that had a row of zeros in it.  What happens if you get an inverse that has a row of zeros in it?  You step away from the desk come back erase and start again because you made a mistake.  Take the universe can't have a row of zeros in it. Because if it did it wouldn't be invertible matrices are invertible. If and only if they have a pivot in every row and every column.  But if you get that the inverse isn't invertible. There's no way it could be an inverse in the first place. Why is that we'll get to that in two slides in case you didn't read ahead already because the inverse of a matrix is always invertible and its inverse is the original Matrix, you take the reciprocal of 1 over a that just gives you a witch is if I already know that a is invertible then I should do this procedure to find its inverse. What if I don't know that it's invertible. I need to check that the Matrix is invertible on the way I do that is to see if it has a pivot in every row or every column.  But that means production on a alone so really should I go ahead and do that road alone to see that it's invertible if it is doing this. No, I don't think so. I think you should always start by assuming that they is invertible steps. The first part of the rubber ducks not going to give you the girls for the first part that you stop if it is that you've already done half the work is no reason to carry around the stuff on the right if you just checking if it's invertible, but the reality is that  It's a safe bet that any random Matrix is invertible. Okay, if I actually give you a random Matrix, like I choose all the numbers randomly generated in Excel or in Matlab. If you generate a random Matrix invertible with probability Matrix inverses of all of them all 1,000 will be invertible invertible is a special properties of matrices. Okay. So generically matrices Square matrices are invertible.  All right. So this is how you find the inverse of a matrix with row reduction. There is one sort of special case that many of you've already staying probably where you don't need to do row reduction because you can remember a formula talk about that message to case how many people know or know of the formula for the inverse of a two-by-two matrix.  Oh not very many of you but a bunch of you ask last day, but that's okay. I want I want you to see it.  So, how are we going to find the inverse of a generic two-by-two Matrix? We're going to use row reduction and this is like a nightmare version of all of those questions with an h and have all four parameters unknown here to get quite messy distractible enough that we can actually do it. I'm going to do a trick where that will allow me to avoid doing arithmetic Sofia the First the first coefficients to match the one I subtract 0 without having to divide 2 into bit another words. I want to get a zero where the sea is now when I'm doing production, so the way I would have to do that is to multiply the first row by - 4a  If that's going to give me fractions, so instead what I'm going to do.  if I'm going to multiply the first row by a spicy and multiply the second row by a loud right remember that you never / 0 * 0  I'm so when we do this weekend explicit A and C are not zero operation.  Okay, so when I do that, I'm going to get that the first road turns into.  AC DC  and then c020 a another reason that I did that is when I subtract.  Row 1 from Row 2  I'm going to get that 0 that I wanted to cuz I arranged it so that those two will match so I get a zero there.  And now over here I get a D minus BC.  The first one the second so I get them minus there.  Okay. Now that's just the first steps before I go any further. I remember finding the inverse of a matrix. The first thing we're doing is making sure that it makes sense to find the inverse which means we need to check to make sure that the Matrix is invertible in columns are not zero, but what about in the second row? I need to see that the second row of the coefficient Matrix has a pivot in it a D minus. BC is non-zero.  Okay, so this must be nonzero in order for the Matrix to be invertible.  And that is that number there that number has a special name that she may have heard of and we'll get into in a couple of weeks. That number is called the determinant of the Matrix a  all square matrices have determinants. We'll get to that later for a square matrix. It's pretty easy to compute it. Okay, it's just what you get when you multiply the diagonal entries and subtract from that the product of the Auntie diagonal entries.  so what we see here is  a is an invertible Matrix determinant is non-zero.  Well, I guess we should also technically say and A and C are nonzero, but actually if you backtrack and look at the special cases where then you would have done different operations, but you would have actually been able to do in order to get it.  Okay, I did not kiss. If we if we continue with the row reduction algorithm will be able to convert going to pay that now. We have no choice and then we do four more steps of row reduction or we're going to get his the following formula for the inverse of this two-by-two Matrix.  And then what happens is that the two die and the entries they get in the Gated.  It's relatively easy to remember if I want to write down the inverse of an arbitrary two-by-two Matrix the way I do it in front of the ID tags on trees and I divide the whole thing by the determinant by a D minus PC does it take okay. Well, let's actually do an example here. So we'll ride this went down. So here's a matrix 1 2 3 4  Is it invertible?  I heard some people whispering. Yes, why is it invertible?  Cuz they determine is not zero. That's a good answer correct, but they're at least one other answer.  although what  all the rows and columns are pivot columns are they parallel columns are linearly independent.  Determinant debt summons called is equal to 1 * 4 - 2 * 3 which is -2 so I have to / -2 and then I swap the four on the one.  And I put minus signs in front of the two in the three.  Okay, then I asked me after I supposed to do that division. So that gives me a minus to hear - 1/2 here positive one here and positive 3/2 there and that's the inverse of a matrix. How many flops die do how many athletic operations? Why did  1 2 3 to calculate the determinant  And then then I had to take that number and divide each of those buy it so I can form or Flop. So I just took 7 flops. That's what it's going to take for any Square Matrix are going to do unless you count the actual action of moving the right so it could be up to 12 flops if your computer has numbers, but it's it's a small number of flops floating Point operations.  And if we actually did production here how many steps would it take? Well, if you look back in your book and we discuss this system.  Kind with a single number of floss it takes to take it to Rohit reduced row Echelon form is about one-third and Cubed actually finding the inverse Matrix. So we have to do that all the operations end times. We're only we're doing it properly and cubed to M cubed is 8  Right. So 2/3 of n cubed.  Is about 6.  Text Lee fewer flops that takes about the same amount of time here as calculating the determinant on using the formula.  So you can do one or the other and it's easy to remember this formula.  This is the only case where a formula makes sense to be clear. There is a formula for the inverse of a 10 by 10 matrix as well Through Math 102 or math 100 the abstract algebra classes after this you to eventually see how it works involves a lot of determinants. So there is a Formula that you can use operations to calculate the inverse but 666 flops. Where is the formula that uses determinants to calculate the inverse of a 10 by 10 matrix takes more than a hundred million flops.  Really bad algorithm cuz it's really not a computational useful tool for anything other than 1/2. Can we talk to you later the inverse of that one?  Why not?  Because the determinant is zero because the two columns are parallel. I heard not invertible.  Okay, see if you wanted to terminate is 2-2 there that is always equivalent size matrices later and the determinant is zero exactly when the Matrix is not invertible. Okay, but that's not a tool determinant. That's most of the work for a 10 x 10 matrix. It takes more than 15 million flops to calculate the determinant where I was to see if it's inverse operations.  Okay, great.  So let's talk about a few more properties of inverses that you're going to use. What is its inverse is invertible. Matrix is actually a  Okay, why is that? It's just check inverse busy. Whatever. That is. That means that speed times a inverse.  Is the identity Matrix that's what it be efficient to. Just check it on one side. So let's check in on this side say  So we want to find Cena. Let's solve for C in this equation. How do I solve for C?  Think think of these is real numbers for a moment if I give you the equation 60/8 equals 1 solve for C.  I heard someone say / a inverse but I want to but that's true. But let's think of it as what it really means which is x a  Okay. So therefore I want to be very nauseatingly pedantic here. So we make sure we understand all the things we're doing the identity Matrix does and then over here. I'm going to use the associate product.  But a inverse times a by definition of a inverse is the identity Matrix.  And therefore I just get see over there.  so  is equal to pay the thing that we didn't know.  Is its own is the inverse of its inverse is itself a matrix is invertible and the inverse you get back to the original Matrix. Here's another important property. What if I take two matrices invertible matrices, is there a product invertible?  Well, let's think about this in terms of linear transformations.  Linear transformations of a I can become X as a linear transformation. And remember we talked about last day that a is invertible. If and only if the linear transformation is onto  An equivalent question here is given two linear Transformations that are both one-to-one and onto if I take their composition.  Well, maybe that doesn't make it any clearer for you. Maybe it makes it less clear, but I want you to think about that as we as we do this because the answer is yes, and if you untwist the definitions of one to one and onto you will see it must be true that both of those conditions are preserved undertaking compositions.  Okay, but for now we can do the same thing.  I'm assuming that it exists even do this calculation, but then we'll see at the end of the calculation shows that it exists that this Matrix is invertible.  So I want to solve for D there somehow was that mean to solve for D? What what is what is what does it mean verse? This means that d x a v  Is the identity.  So I'm going to do the same thing. I did before first. I'm going to use associativity of matrix multiplication.  I want to solve the first thing I'm going to do is move the be over to the other side. So I'll X  by B inverse. I know that b is invertible so I get the inverse there.  but over here  I'm going to use associativity of matrix multiplication again.  And b x v inverse by definition is the identity.  So I got that da is equal to be inverse.  that hasn't  4D yet, but now I can repeat the same calculation.  So I multiply on both sides by inverse.  And on this side, I'll note that.  5SOS but using associative  D is equal to that which is almost what you might have expected, but there's a wrinkle  I asked you what's the inverse of 8 times the answer is inverse X call? Well, that's one of the product of the reciprocals and that's true here as well. Except we have to keep in mind we have to always remember that matrix multiplication is not generally commutative. If you want to find the inverse of the product AV you have to take the inverse is in the other order.  If you multiply inverse X Universe that resulting thing is not the inverse of a b inverse of ba with might not be the same as heavy.  That's a useful property that you'll need to use and remember on your homework. For example, there's one more I want to do down here and I'm not going to do the calculation because it turns out to look exactly like the things we are here but this is just something that you should know. And you can look how it works in the textbook if I take the transpose of a matrix.  then  What if I asked you to find the inverse of a transpose? That's what we're doing here. Well, I I know how to do that. I take the transpose and then I put a transpose next to the identity and I carry it to the reduced row Echelon form get the identity on the left and a inverse transpose on the right between a transpose inverse and a inverse.  Inverse of the transpose is the same as the transpose of the inverse.  Invert taking inverse and taking transpose those operations commute with each other. So if I tell you what the inverse of a transpose is a and Perseus and vice-versa fax to have in your back pocket.  Everything I want to talk about with invertible matrices for now. We will of course be coming back to them over and over with them on your homework. Thanks for sure. I love Simon cuz Matlab, of course.  No, let's move on to chapter 4. So this isn't a huge shift and topics right now. We're going to be starting the course again. We're going to be coming back next day already. But it's a it's a big shift not just in topic, but also in thought process and I want to preface this by saying you're going to want to review what we do in this half of this lecture and in tomorrow's lecture several times, you're going to want to watch this podcast again, you going to want to read the textbook several times and you lots of exercises because this is a real shift from things you've been doing so far. We're moving from concrete to abstract the first time that you'll ever do that in a math class for most of you.  And you're you're all going to get it no problem, but it's going to take a little bit of effort and it's going to take a few passes through before it really sticks. And that's just how it goes fishing is love to love to use strange symbols help you interpret them. But you're going to get the part of what we're going to do right now is okay and figuring out how it all fits together. That's your job. That's why it's going to be useful to review over and over what we do here. So want to talk about Vector spaces. I've already used that term many times informally when I talked about the domain and codomain of a linear transformation that took what are vectors living in our space.  definition of what it means  So first, I want to be a little informal but tell you the idea of a vector space. What is it? It is a collection of objects definition of taking calculus a function is differentiable. If abstract definition of what that means and then loss of examples of differentiable functions that have calculate the derivatives giving you an abstract definition. This is what a vector space is it is this kind of object and then will show lots of examples of things that match that definition. That's your space is a set of object object of vectors.  And what makes it a vector space has two operations defined on it. What does it mean to have an operation to find out if I have the set operations are you and see I can produce a new element of that set, which I call you plus.  I mean you might be saying come on Camp. I know how to do this. I've done this a thousand times a thousand times in the case of RN, right? So that's a good example. RN is a vector space. It's a vector space here. So if I have two vectors is called them.  A-1 B-1 and C1 and the next Spector at the operation of plus I tell you is defined by the equal sign means I'm defining this to be equal to a 1 + 1 + 821 + B2 and that's the definition of and I Define there's some to be that thing.  I could have been giving you some weird definition definition but not every definition is good. Definition wouldn't give you a vector space here because they're certain properties that these these operations have to satisfy which will get to on the next but for now just want to say we have a set of objects instead of objects. And I'm going to Define to operations on it. One of them is Edition, which is some rules.  And the second one is called scalar multiplication, which is a rule that takes one of the object vectors.  Any real number and scalar product one of the vectors?  And I know for RN I know how that's defined. I told you it's defined by scaling all of the entries.  Give us the definition of scalar multiplication for the vector space RN.  But the key fact here, is that a vector space could consist of other things back to this? What is a vector so concretely at the beginning list of real numbers of a fixed-length.  What's important about that makes them vectors why they call them vectors and R and a vector space is that it has these two operations you can add them and you can scan them multiply them.  Okay, and we'll see you in a few minutes examples that are not our end. It supposed to make sense that has two operations editions get them application to find on it. Now. It's a little more involved than that, right? You can't just have any operations that you want.  You have to have the operations play nicely together is a vector space means.  I already have a particular element has special properties because we always have has played a critical role right we talked about homogeneous equations with a 0 on the right and then 0 is a solution 0 is the additive identity right? 0 + 0 is a set of objects with a distinguished member. We call the zero Vector has two operations to find Onnit addition and scalar multiplication.  And I have to define those on whatever said in that means that I take any two elements of the vector space and it must return a new element of the vector space one way to say that is that the case is closed under addition. Okay, so that some of the two vectors has to be in that same set of objects and then all of these things together the vectors together with those operations, they must satisfy all whole properties and I'm not going to write them down here. But if you open your textbooks to page 192, they're all listed there. There's about 15 properties, but they all satisfy you do not have to memorize those properties because you already know those properties does property say addition and scalar multiplication work the way your intuition tells you they should from all your experience with arithmetic.  It tells you things like alright a few of them down at tells you things like.  U + V is equal to V plus has to be commutative and that if I add two vectors and then add a third  Then I get the same result if I add the second and the third.  With the first in front like that. Okay Edition is supposed to be  Associative and also the scalar multiplication is distributive over addition that if I scale the sum of two vectors, that's the same thing as scaling the vectors and adding them up afterwards.  these kind of property things like + 0 or 0 + 2 is equal to you for every Vector you  Okay, those are the properties or some of the properties that make a vector space a vector space and there's a there's many more but again, lights them as mathematicians we would call these things axioms. I'm giving you an abstract structure and I'm placing some axioms down but it satisfies and in principle, you're supposed to drive everything you want to know about the from those axioms in practice. We get used to applying them and we often hide them in the background. So I don't have to do is a formal proof using the exact same as every time and in fact, you'll see all the vector spaces will work with in this class are more or less of the variety that you've already been working with like inside RN so you don't need to worry too much working in the background.  Okay. So a vector space is a set of objects is a distinct Factor. There's an operation Edition on the vectors. There's no operations scalar multiplication to find a real number operations produced those operations satisfy all of the properties that station are supposed to satisfy from your intuition from real arithmetic from grad school the byline hear the moral of the story. So we're going to go different ways which are list of real numbers of some finite height. I'm fixed height. Let's work with a new Vector space. Now that is not of that form. At least it's not presented in that form.  Objects of art is human work with him going to call it pop.  And this is the set of all polynomials functions.  in a single variable  that's my set of objects the set of polynomials like for example.  T-Rex is X cubed minus 2X.  And Q of X is equal to x squared plus 2X + 1 and what's called is just a constant polynomial. Those are three examples of polynomials.  If you're working with polynomials, and that's true, but maybe I'll do that and I'll cross it out right now.  That's not to say that that's not relevant for us right now. Is it things you can multiply polynomials as vectors?  Can you use numbers and we'll see how that I need to tell you what the polynomial is how to add polynomials how to scale a multiply a polynomial by a real number?  What's P + Q X? I know how to add functions. I just add their values of X cubed minus 2x + x squared + 2 + 1 I know I'll use the properties of addition of real numbers to write this as X cubed.  Plus x squared minus 2x + 2x gives me 0 there fluff one. Now. That's a new polynomial under which power of polynomials is closed.  I can take two x p a tax that means two times x cubed minus 2x which means just two x cubed minus 4X and that's still a polynomial.  So these things are closed under addition and the scalar multiplication operations if I take p  an ad zero to it at the zero polynomial it let's let's write that as Z of x.  That's just X cubed minus 2x + 0 which is just X cubed minus 2x which is p zero polynomial polynomial back. Nothing changed. That's just like the zero Vector it is the zero Vector space if I were really going to verify that the definitions, you know for addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials satisfy all of those properties, but also very easy in Hand by the way.  So I'm not going to make you do it but it is true here. That's that all those properties will hold so the space of polynomials is a vector space can take an exponent as an atom Vector operations are supposed to work.  P sub equals 3 and this is the set of polynomials.  of degree  3  cancel  This P hear that one has degree 3 power. The highest power is 3.  Where is this one of your queue? It has degree 2.  its highest power has degree to  Soapy so kieu is not in this new set piece set.  Sop is in here to is not in here. I'll give you this piece of equals 3.  And I'll Define on it editions. Is it a vector space or not?  So before we ask that question, what do we need to do to figure out if it's true?  I'm sorry.  Test all the proper. It's okay great. So we need to check if the addition is.  commutative associative distributive addition  but  we have to be careful and go back to the very beginning of the definition. We had to have space. It has to be a set.  With an additional option and it has to be closed under the operation given two vectors. There's some has to be a vector. So let's for example take  We saw that P.  Is in there.  RX  Minus x cubed minus X cubed is a degree 3 polynomial.  And so that one is in the set piece of equals 3.  T-Rex plus two bags  is equal to  x cubed minus 2x plus minus X cubed which is equal to -2X.  My stress is a polynomial. Does it have degrees three?  Now that's a degree 1 polynomial. This is not in this set piece of equals 3.  Oh, yeah, sorry.  Sakura 2 polynomials piano the set of polynomials of degree but there is not a pain. That means not a vector space. It's not closed under the vector operations.  not a vector space  But we can modify it a little bit.  Okay, so P Subs tree.  Is the set of polynomials?  of degree  Less than or equal to 3.  Okay.  And this one is a vector space.  Cancel some of the terms that have only a few of the terms left or else they would have been high degree to start with.  Degree, 3 polynomial looks like that where a b c and d are real numbers.  No to be clear here. This is what this is.  If I wanted to describe piece of equals 3 from the last slide in the same terms, I would have exactly the same description.  Except that the important condition would be that a cannot be 0 but you can't have the coefficient of x cubed to be zero or else it would be a degree. What's 410?  So this thing is not a vector space with where you insist that the choice to see that we need to be able to multiply the polynomials by 0.  I thought you can't take something in there and * 0 it's not going to be in there anymore.  Take a look at the zero of polynomial which has degree zero.  So the set of polynomials of degree less than space and it's a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication the way we usually know how to do those operations. So it might be one x squared plus one. Let's add that to  a 2x cubed + a + b 2 x squared plus C 2x + D2  So, how do I add those up? Well, I take the coefficients in front of the X cubes and add them.  I take the coffee stands in front of the x squared as an atom.  I checked the coefficients in front of the Exodus and Adam.  I take the coefficients in front of the  0 is an atom. That's how I add polynomials by adding up the like degree qualifications.  I just want to put here supposed for the moment. So this is Mirror Universe. Now look at that are for.  vectors in R4 look like A-1 B-1 C1 D1  How do I add two of those A2 B2 C2 and D2?  I add them by adding the like coefficients.  That's exactly copy over from three sides ago, except actually all we're doing.  Is we're taking the thing we saw before our for a list of phone numbers and we're writing them in a different way instead of writing them as a one-time is standard basis Vector + age of cyclist. Let's ride. So this one is a 1 + a 2 times the standard basis Vector V1 plus B1 + B2 C2 plus C1 plus C. Two times the standard back to factory 3 + 1 + 1 is the vector 1000 inches of actor 0100 and so forth compare.  What we just did.  here  with what we did over here.  All we've done is renamed equal to X cubed equals x squared equal to x + 84 equal to what?  That's really all abstract. Vector spaces are about it's always going to boil down to  taking the same thing. We've already done in RN.  And renaming the standard basis vectors as something new now. It's a slightly more complicated than that will have language next day to understand exactly how to always do the translation. But as you're going through always remember that the operations are always going to look like the ones we've seen an RN because they're always isomorphic to the ones we've seen so always look like RN for us, so we'll continue it.
