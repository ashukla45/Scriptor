I will make a decision on Friday about how many people from the waitlist to let in a little bit but as you can see we're already over full. So there are fire regulations about the number of students who can be more students in the class. That would be unfair to them.

You couldn't be this afternoon class can follow me back from my office it from here to my office and I'll be there from 1 to 3 p.m. My office is in a P&M which is over there applied physics and Math building. I would have no Applied Physics it it's the mass building. My office is 5202 and I'm happy to talk to any of you that are there any questions over here before we start?  Okay. So are there any questions before we start?  So let's get started.  We're going to start by continuing about row Echelon Form K. This is the critical critical structure for matrices that we need to get to when we joined usual questions about solving systems and whether you can solve and how far you can go in solving linear systems of equations.  Okay, so here is an example of a matrix that is in row Echelon form over there. So please try to keep it down. If I'm distracted. I guarantee you a lot of people around you are also distracted. This Matrix is in row Echelon form people have asked on Piazza Russian form for a non Square Matrix zeros below. The diagonals recognized here is the means  That you have these leading in the ones that are green squares there with is the first non-zero enter reading from the Zero Entry in that row.  Salon Forum in a row Echelon form is to say that okay, if I look at any given row and I look at its but it's leading entry has to be further over to the right upside down further to the right.  rice wine farm, but the full definition of relational leading entry of a row of the entry of the above it for each row and then one more technical thing is that if you ever have a row of all zeros, all of those have to be at the bottom  The row reduction algorithm is designed to produce a matrix in this form and we use row operations to eliminate eliminate all of the countries below their done with the so-called forward. And once that form we can answer the question.  Does the system represented by the segmented Matrix have a solution? Is it consistent or not? And if it is consistent is the solution unique or are there infinitely many solutions. Are we going to do several examples today to point out again exactly how that works the important for those are okay these  columns  These columns in this particular Matrix. That is the columns that has the leading entries in them. These are called the pivotal columns.  If they're pivotal to the understanding of this system.  And the entries in those leading entries in those call of the sometimes called the pivots. That's a bit of a pun. I think that's called tivity.  Play that's the way that numerical linear algebra and ends.  So those are the pivotal columns.  I'm in this example for a friend since there are four pivotal columns 5 rows and 9 columns. Plus the augmented column.  What's the maximum number of pivotal columns that this Matrix could have had?  Not quite that certainly is an upper Bound for it. It couldn't be more than  yes.  Exactly the number of rows and in this case when there are more columns and rows.  Explanation just have to substitute.  each pivotal column  has a leading entry in it and a leading entry has to be in one of the Rose.  There can be no more than one pivotal column for each row there. There might be a few are the last row here has no leading entry. You can have even fewer pivotal columns. Then there are rows but in general the number of pivotal call number of columns bigger than the minimum of those two numbers or you have more more variables about you can't have more pivot columns in number.  And that's going to tell us something about the solubility of the system but having the Matrix in a row Echelon form is not good enough to answer the question of what is the final answer is up. There are no Solutions.  You need to do further operations with the backward phase of the row reduction algorithm is in higher rows.  You take the Matrix to reduced row Echelon form in here is the schematic of reduced row Echelon form and that means that you divide through each of the nonzero Rose by country once in the pivotal entries.  Operation starting at the bottom, right?  Using that pivotal one down there and using appropriate multiples of that road to subtract from higher Rose in order to get zeroes above it. And then you continue back 701 and the next back and so forth because you produce those zeros above the further on one where you're in row Echelon form. There are only zeros above and below every form you can now answer the question. What is the solution sets will give you a complete description.  looks like  form and reduced row Echelon form the pivotal columns. Haven't moved.  You can recognize which columns are the pivot column and then take the ones and zeros with a single one in some.  And then the serum the important theorem that we got to last day.  is that  every Matrix  can be carried.  2 reduced row Echelon form  by row operations  and this form  is unique  so what that means operations operations, if one way and you do it another way that you might choose different orders of operations, right? There are the three kinds of operations that were allowed to use we can or we can swap two rows. No following those rules. You're going to be able to get it to a forum like this.  operations in totally different different operations  Okay, almost sure that you'll get use different algorithms along the way if you have a big enough Matrix, but the remarkable thing is it doesn't matter what order you do those operations doesn't matter exactly one reduced row Echelon form. You can never get too. It's not just that this one schematic you can get to the same numbers will appear where the stars are. There. It is a uniquely defined thing that you always get to buy joint operations and falling the algorithm no matter what order of operations.  So it tells us the simplest form for the system could possibly be in the simplest form?  So that's when we're giving a system operations on form entries in the pivot City.  That'll allow us to answer the question of is there a solution if so are there is only one or are there many if you want to actually throw excellent form that tells you the full solution to clarify.  Okay, so let's do this example equations in 4 unknowns.  Before we even start we know that the pivotal columns are going to be important in understanding the system. What is the maximum number of pivotal columns? We could possibly find in the even do anything we can figure out there are at most this many for this system. What is that number? How many could we possibly have yet?  Cuz there are 3 rows and 4 columns and the minimum of those two numbers is 3 let's see what happens in this operations.  This one already has a 0 and 1/2 entry below the first one there was a tro.  You know, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the first row added to the third row and put the result in the third row.  Get up going to give the desired 0 there.  The -7 will add to the seven and give a zero their 0 adds to -4 that doesn't do anything from six adds to giving 812.  And that didn't affect the first two rows.  Okay. I know we were starting to recognize we're getting close and the second leading entry is in the position and that's a leading one already and we've got zeroes where we need them except in order for it to be in a row Echelon form to just one more thing we need to do which is to get a zero below that leading one in the second row the third row and that's not allowed because it has to be to the right. It's putting a tree has to be to the right of the third column because the second row above it has wood column. So we need to get rid of that - 4 using a row operation.  And so that's easy. We're going to add four times road to the rosary, but the result in rosary.  Okay, and so that's going to give us our desired 0 here and then finally  and -3 * 4 is -12 adding to that 12 gives us a 08.  Okay, this Matrix is in row Echelon form.  We have that upside down staircase answer. All the questions is identify which are the pivotal columns. Can someone tell me which columns are the pivotal columns.  Yes.  Yes, that's correct column 1 and column three other people that have the pivotal entries that have the lead in them. So there's no third column. This one actually only has two pivotal columns.  Okay. Now I said that we have enough information to answer the question. What is the status of the solutions that he run to see why that is in this case. Let me go ahead and I will write down what the solution set looks like and then we can see the pattern of how everything we need to know before I wasn't a 7in that lower right entry suppose that's in the third row. We had nonzero on the right hand side 05. What could we say right now?  yes, that is an inconsistent system because  if I had had a nonzero entry in that last column.  That would mean that that third row there. It's leading entry is in the last column.  which would say that the last column is a pivotal column the right now, is that if  the final  augmented column  is pivotal  the system  is inconsistent  So that's one thing we can recognize right away look for the pivotal columns. And if the last color solution stop their locations of the pivotal columns don't change so we can stay in the original.  And those were the only two columns we couldn't tell that form format this Matrix row operations.  So now to finish putting this Matrix into reduced row Echelon form.  Oh, wait a second.  Is this Matrix in reduced row Echelon form that I cooked it up already?  And so now we can actually completely write down what the solutions that looks like.  So what I mean by that is let's translate equations now. So the equation say the first one says text 1 - 7 x 2  + 6 x 4 equals 5 and the second equation says X3.  -2 x 4  equals -3  the solution in a slightly different form  We're looking for the set of all points x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 that solve the system of equations, right? So.  I'm telling you that. Set can be characterized exactly like this.  X3 and X5 X2 and X4 are not in pivotal collops specify their values. They are totally remember what we call them. Well, let slip the late great Tom Petty answer that question.  I was just wandering around the country leaving their girlfriends. When does the next 4 and whatever we want to plug in for them. We will find a solution with x 2 is whatever we want the one sweep in those down notice equations over here. This one in this one the first equation there says x 1 is equal to 7X.  -6 x 4 + 5 + that equation says x 3 is equal to 2 x 4.  And that is the solution.  set  hey right here.  So that tells us that.  Yes, this equation this system of equations has a solution that has many solutions.  It has a two parameter Family Solutions. Those are the free variables.  X2 and X4 are free.  And what that means is that those two columns?  Either here.  Or hear. Those are the free columns or they correspond to the three.  And so now we have a complete description. So we already stopped if you have that the 3rd, the final column is pivotal. Then there are no solution if it is not to be okay. Otherwise  the system  is consistent  okay, but now the finals of the further question is okay is consistent. But is there one solution one unique solution or infinitely many solutions 7 solution. Why does it economy between one solution or infinitely many solutions because if there are  free variables  there are infinitely many solutions.  Whereas if not if there are no free variables.  Which is the same thing as saying?  every column  in the coefficient Matrix  is pivotal  Then there is one solution.  Okay. So here we see the total solution set is described as the set of points where well first we have to fry meters the two free variables and we can set them free whatever we want. So since I can choose then the other those are determined and we have a complete description of the solution set.  Know if there were no free variables, but the system was consistent then that means there's one unique 10 down solution. They're free to choose that we would just get something like 5 0 - 3 0 as our only solution  Is it has been consistent or not? And if it's consistent as a solution unique or not?  now we see we actually didn't have to go all the way to reduce trash one from  What's the weather in row Echelon form? We know where the free variables are. So the first thing we look at is. Is there a pivot in the last column? If so, no solution. If not count the number of three variables if there are any free variables the variable coefficient Matrix.  Okay. Now this case as we saw some from the very beginning because there were more rows or columns and rows here. We couldn't possibly have as many pivot couldn't possibly have as many pivotal columns as there are columns.  I throw four columns, but we could have at most three several columns and we are actually only two but there were three three variable. Is it parenting to be at least one column which is not pivotal so we can stay looking at that system just from the size of it just from the fact that there were more columns and rows that this thing can't have it might have no Solutions.  But if it has any solutions at all, it will have infinitely many just from looking at the size of the Matrix and then if you want to check if it has any Solution by carrying it to reduced to a row Echelon form.  Okay.  So here's another example.  Which I've already done you the service of converting of carrying to a row Echelon form.  I will now finish doing the algorithm to carry it to reduce Russell on form is the system consistent and if so, does it have one solution or infinitely many solutions. I'm going to give you 10 seconds and then we're going to take a three-way boat.  Please go ahead and talk to your neighbors.  Okay.  Last three options are inconsistent. No Solutions, consistent Solutions or consistent inconsistent.  I see a few very tentative hands how many people think that is consistent with infinitely many solutions that looks like one unique solution. There is one confident and in the back again, I like the confidence, but you're dead wrong.  But thanks for your courage democracy works on the way we can see that is just to say okay. Let's look where the pivotal columns are columns are the columns.  That contain the leading entries. So the first row has a leading entry in the first entry. That's the first non-zero entry reading from the left the second row. It's leading in the second column to the second column is pivotal the third row. It's leaving entry is in the headlines here to make sure where am I so those are the entries  The final column is the sixth column is not typical.  The system is consistent.  And so these three columns The Columns corresponding to free variables.  are the  fourth fifth third fourth and sixth columns and the columns are the 1st 2nd and 5th.  But to answer the question I wanted you to answer just now if you are still in your account first, he recognizes the last column pivotal the answer is no perfect  Now are there any free variables?  There are actually three variables I should say here again. We have to be careful. The last column has a different status than the other ones. So it's not that there are three free variables. The last color doesn't correspond to a variable. There are three columns that are non pivot and two of them are X3 and X4.  Okay. So now we know the answer the question this has infinitely many solutions. And actually there will be a two parameter family of solutions. Now, let's actually describe that solution, which means we have to carry this Matrix Salon forum.  Okay. Well actually it's pretty close already and the calculations we would arrive at the same answer. That's what's crucial here in front of The Matrix.  We don't make any mistakes.  Which we are very likely to be there. So that's going to give me a nice looking.  Okay. Alright. Am I in reduced row Echelon form?  Why not?  The pivotal ones to 101 don't have zero as above so we need to do operations with the later steps. We start now at the right lower part of The Matrix.  So I'm going to take Row 3 and subtract it from row to put the result in Row 2.  Okay, so that's going to give me the desired 0 above that one. It's not going to affect any of the earlier entries in that row.  Except I was going to do is affect the last column there still wear subtracting four from -3 - 7.  And you know, I'm going to subtract Rows 3 from Rogue one, but there's nothing real one it well, actually, I'm going to subtract twice free from 1 to get rid of the two. They're all the zeros mean that the earlier entries aren't going to move.  And I'm going to get my designs are there and all that matters here is that I'm subtracting two times for from 5-3 there.  You know, I'm almost done is just one more pesky not above which is the -3 above the second leading one to roll one for the result in Row 1.  Pics that will get me the desired zeros, it won't affect all of these guys.  And I'm not going to have enough space there. So let's do it down here.  Okay, so  This one remains unaffected that zero stays where it is as we wanted this for in this -3 are unaffected, but that one down there is now what are we doing? We're adding.  twice Road to Nowhere using road to so that's not going to change that but twice Row 2 is -14 in the left column - 3 is -17  And that Matrix is in reduced row Echelon form. Yes.  Third column first row. Of course. It's very easy to get lost in in what you're doing.  Sorry, we were I was looking at Row 3 instead of road to select.  that gives us the position but not have * 3  and have to multiply that by three giving me 6 and adds to -3 giving me a 3 there now, I think.  is still  is there an adding three times up? I'm adding three times row to Touro one. So let's by 3 * 7.  so that's three times -7 is -21 - 3 - 24  any more mistakes?  I'm going to pretend that I made all those mistakes on purpose. So you guys could catch them would ever do this calculation. That's why I'm making you all do it 25 times because if you want to actually get this thing to do right now, but just because you have a calculator on your phone that doesn't mean that you don't need to learn how to add before you can effectively use the computer to do it properly, which means you have to Fumble around in calculations 25 * 15 questions.  Okay. So let's quickly now looking at the registration form. We can characterize the solutions that there are five variables here.  We're going to write down what the solution set looks like first. We identify which are the three variables. That's these two guys. We saw out there X3 and X4. So those two are just in the solution set. Those are the parameters you can set those equal to whatever you want.  And then x 1 x 2 and x 5 x 1/3 - 3 equals -24 so you move over the -2 x 3 + 3x for the other one is equal to 2 x 3 - 3 x 4 - 24 you get the X2 is equal to 2 x 3 - 2 x 4 - 7 and that X5 is just equal to 4.  Nice, at least we isolated x 5 x 5 isn't just determined by X-ray next four. It's actually determined so it's fixed. The solution has X5 must always before but X1 and X2. Those are only determined after we choose the free variables X values there is the solution set.  Okay. So this is the sort of thing you need to be able to do at the drop of a hat. You need to be able to do operations to find it and a reduced row Echelon form and then write down the solution set in a farm like this.  We'll see how to use that a different ways as we go forward from here. Is technical skill that you order to do the more interesting things that come later in this course?  And those more interesting things were going to start to do with vectors.  So now we're starting section 1.3 about vectors.  So what is a vector?  Anybody in here taking now or has taken first year physics?  Yeah, okay. So what's a vector?  You've been voluntold to answer.  Thank you. Thank you for giving the physics answer which is complete nonsense.  But that you were tired. Anyways, I was a physics major. I still have no idea what that means that there's some truth to that you can make sense of it in certain ways. But anyway, and for mathematicians a vector at least for now starting a vector is just a finite list of numbers will usually write as a column. So maybe if I the kind of actors were talking about what's 1 - 2 and 2/5 is our major Seas. By the way, this is the Matrix 1 by 2 Matrix.  So those are two vectors and those two vectors are in our two. You have two components h100 -1 * 4.  Has four components just a list of 4 numbers.  Here's another Vector. Today's closing stock prices for the stocks in the S&P 500.  Okay, so that's a column of numbers and how long does it how many stocks are there in the S&P 500 but this is a vector in R 505 at 1 p.m. Today. Cuz many columns does the 505 numbers.  alright, so, alright, that's kind of a silly name for something but  Vectors are things that you can add.  And scalar multiply, that's really what a vector is so far.  1 - 2  and two five I can add those two vectors together. I'll just add them component wise.  1 + 2 is 3 - 2 + 5 is 3 Vector 3 3.  Okay, so that's what a vector is a vector is a list of numbers thought of in a way that allows us to add them together and give meaning to that.  I can also multiply a vector that first one by a scalar I can * 2.  The vectors are list of numbers that can be added to two list of numbers two vectors of the same length to be added together to give a new back of that same light X.  No, you can also Imagine ways we could to find multiplying two vectors together like we did get into here. So we usually don't talk about it. We usually don't do it will take about adding vectors but not multiplying vectors together.  Is Frost list of numbers and adding them as there is a geometric meeting are those vectors from the last flight again? 1 - 2 + 2 5  And I saw that when I add them together I get the vector 3 3 as a geometric way to make that happen, which is 2 - 122 1-2 the way I do that.  is to take that second Vector say  And move it up to the tip of the last Specter. So I take that second affect your 1-2 and I move its tail thought it was a narrow here in the Cartesian plane. I move its tail up to the tip of the first factor and then I draw  The straight line that goes from the tail of the first Vector to the tip of this new one.  Okay, I'm that Vector is indeed the vector.  three three  So this is called plus my 1-2 and there was a geometric procedure for doing that moving the second. Let's take that.  first vector  and move it down too much.  And move it down to the tip of the vector below ignore that other Red Line there.  If we draw the green line going up to the point where that new two vectors goes It goes to the same place. It doesn't matter what another shape that we made in the process that shape that has four sides.  And they come in pairs waraich are parallel to each other. That's a parallelogram.  It's called the parallelogram law.  Friday's actors  So that's a geometric interpretation of of vector addition here and Vector multiplication. That just means I make it longer in that same direction.  All right, so we can add vectors geometrically by the parallelogram law but really it's just a matter of adding the components. It's a simple simple thing that you can all do now when you first learned in elementary school how to add numbers together.  You learned a whole bunch of rules for the properties of this addition. It doesn't matter what order you add?  And it doesn't matter if you have three of them whether you add the first two first in the third one later or the last person the first one later.  Okay, so that's called. There's a number zero what you can add to anything without changing. It is a vector of all zeros to add that to a vector. You don't change it. Every Vector has a negative just by taking the negatives of all of the entries and when you add that to the original you get the zero vector and so on Down the Line rules of multiplication by scalars as well. Okay. So all of the usual properties you expect for addition real numbers. They also hold for addition and scalar multiplication of vectors.  Peso vectors are things that you can look just like you would expect from what you learned for how to add and multiply real numbers.  Okay, let me finish with one final thing here, which is the talk about linear combinations.  So here are two vectors.  -21 + 2 1  now we talked about adding two vectors before we talked about those things.  negative  the first Factor an added to twice the second vector.  Call the linear combination of those two vectors that is and I multiply them by doing an operation like that is called a linear combination of those vectors where I combine them by using scalar multiplication and addition visualize what that means.  Form if I just keep putting a scalar multiples by integers and if I want to figure out where on this grid. Factor is to make it a little easier. Let's let's not do to their let's just do minus the first one plus the second one.  Play I just look here on this grid and I'm going down here - 1 * the first one and I'm at the. Hector there.  Tophatter there is is the one that I've drawn their linear combinations of vectors and the reason why it's important than the last thing was here.  Is Spam almost every day from now on?  the span  of a collection of vectors  Is the stats?  of all linear combinations  of those factors  doctors that I can find  take a scalar multiples of the vectors in my given set and adding them off in different ways. It's a complicated geometric object is understand how to solve linear systems of equations. So that's what we're going to start with next week. There's No lecture on Monday. Enjoy your long weekend and I'll see you in "
