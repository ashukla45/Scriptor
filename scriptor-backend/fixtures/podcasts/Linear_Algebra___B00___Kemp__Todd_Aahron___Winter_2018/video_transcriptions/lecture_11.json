    "Full Transcript": "Good morning, everyone.  Sorry for the slightly late start. I got here 7 minutes ago and realized I left my apple pencil at home. So I ran to the bookstore. That's how much I love you.  Alright, let's talk very briefly about the midterm.  I'm very happy with how you guys did on the midterm.  No, I'm actually really happy with how you did. It was a little trickier than the practice midterms in retrospect. I think the trouble which was  or eggs was actually on homework.  That problem was one of the assigned theoretical textbook exercises.  I told you that the hard problem would be similar to that was very similar. But but it was tricky and you did very well.

There's one little bit of one question which has yet to be finished. It will be done this afternoon. I will release exams to you this afternoon to see the median is close to 22 out of 30.  Braids will be in the B range. Okay. So what am I to do when I released the grades from grade scope and that email will include a detailed breakdown of what approximate letter grades corresponds to what numerical grade on the midterm.  okay, as well as in a little bit of discussion of  what you should do with that information and so I'll just say right now as is written in blue up here. But today is drop without a w deadline if you want to drop a course today is the deadline for that. No, I'm not saying that. Okay, so you're going to know how you did on this midterm and what approximate grade that corresponds to the for 11:59 p.m. Tonight, which is when that deadline in  What you do with that information is up to you if you ended up doing kind of lousy on this midterm, but you expected to do kind of lousy because you had this going on or because you didn't actually study enough and you know, why you didn't do well and you feel like you can correct that then great.  After all remember the grading policy is that if one of your midterms is much higher than the other and you do well on the final then the lower midterm won't end up counting the credit from your lowest midterm can get transferred to the final if that ends up benefiting your grade in the end.  If on the other hand, you see that you're one of the few people who did quite poorly on the midterm and you don't really know why you didn't quite poorly then you might think about whether this isn't the right time to continue with this course and try taking it again in the future. This is one of those times when if you have such concerns, please go ahead and email me. Yes is probably not the right place for them. This is not going to be something that affects many of you. Okay. So look at your grade. Look at your exam. Go ahead and email me if you have some concerns and I'll try to be as responsive this afternoon and evening as I can be.  For the time being gay. So watch out for that for the time being we're going to proceed. So now we're going to go on with the lecture material for today after two more quick reminders. Your next Matlab assignment is due next week next Friday one week from today at 11:59 p.m. Next MyMathLab homework set which is a double length because it is due on Monday, February 12th.  All right, so I'd like to now proceed.  With the lecture topic for today, which is 2.2 and 2.3 the inverse Matrix are the Matrix of the inverse of a matrix next time we'll actually continue a little bit with that beginning of the next lecture and then proceed to chapter 4. So as your reading ahead you should now be starting to look at chapter 4  Alright, so here's the idea for what we're going to be talking about today. I'm going to go back again to grade school algebra, okay.  Where the first kind of algebraic equation you ever saw was something like a x equals P seventh-grader. It was right or 3x equals 6 or something like that.  And you solve for x and you know, this is very silly. But let's do it nauseatingly explicitly. How would we solve for x get well first things first?  if a  is 0  Then you can't solve for x.  If x equals zero, then this equation says 0 x x true or false. It's true statement for all X or it's false.  Okay, then we got up here. We have this equation ax equals B.  Take well where she already discussed this.  in the second or third lecture  What we do here is just one row operation. It divides through is where multiplying both sides of the equation by another number 1 / a  and then were using the properties of multiplication which say that if I multiply 1  that's the same thing as a distributive property.  I rather expect this number which has the  that's how it's defined.  And so I've already made a mistake because I didn't carry through the equal sign when I divide 0 by 8.  And so finally that tells me putting this all together that I've solved x equals be overnight.  Okay, so there that's how we solve linear equations in one variable.  What about a matrix equation ax equals B how to solve Matrix equations?  And we have all sorts of serums that tell us how it's going to go. What kind of outcomes we can expect very briefly forgot, you know, 7th grade algebra type of situation. Can we divide by a is there a 1 / a 1 / 2 Matrix a that I can use here and multiply both sides by one ready to solve the equation. That's the sort of question. I want to sometimes. Yes. We will deal. This specific example.  So here's a matrix equation.  I never said I could be over there. This is a 2 by 3 Matrix to solve this Matrix equation.  So if I wanted to follow suit what I did, I need to find one over a what is that mean looking carefully over here what it means what we needed.  Was this property right here?  We needed to find a matrix a with the property that 1/8 times a day is equal to 1.  What is the multiplicative identity of the real numbers?  So similar if we want to make that exact is find a matrix.  So that c x a is the identity Matrix.  Okay, so well, let's actually just work this out. I've cooked this one up here. Let's supposed to do the multiplication first things first. Tell me how big is the Matrix.  Two by two, right? Cuz the first one is to buy 3 second one is three by to the insides match. So the product makes sense. The outsides are two and two so it's a two-by-two matrix.  I must work out what it is.  Okay, I'm going to multiply that column by that column.  And I just made that entry and what is it? What's 1 - 0 + 0 which is 1  then I'm going to multiply that First Column by the that first row by the second column of a it gives me 1 - 1 + 0 which is 0  Next I will multiply the second row of sea by the first row of a 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 see by the second column of a 0 + 1 + 0.  That we found a one day we found a matrix X it on the left as we go forward because remember that much of matrix multiplication doesn't commit in general.  So that c x a is the identity Matrix.  Okay, so how's that going to help us what's exactly this equation?  Up here, which is a x equals B.  So what I'm going to do is multiply both sides by a  x a x t x ax equals c b  okay, because I suppose be there for c x x equals e x b and I use the associative property of matrix multiplication.  But we just saw that c x a is the identity Matrix. So this is  c x speed story  What's better?  C * B  This is I X X is a CV equation.  Well, you know that's just dumb as double-check that.  c x v  1 - 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 + 0 + 0 + 0  the second entry  Ocean is x 0.  Does that make sense?  Can you tell from the tone of my voice if it doesn't make sense? Hopefully you can also tell just by looking that doesn't make sense.  because a * 0  Is 0800 and that's not equal to be?  That's weird. I thought we solved it, but it looks like we got a wrong solution.  And actually it's even worse than that because we know how to solve this equation x equals.  A great great. Yes. We use row reduction.  So let's do that 1 0 1 1 1 2 is the coefficient Matrix and the bee on the Atlantic 00 one. So, let's do one step of production will subtract the first row from the Third.  And then exit let's do one more step of row reduction now subtract the second row from the Third.  What what is the tell me about this equation?  It does equation doesn't exist.  It's inconsistent. Thank you.  I guess I just didn't hear you. Right this is an inconsistent equation that has no solution.  So what on Earth is going on here or what is going on here? Cuz we have to be very careful about logical implications very careful about how the words we use are put together and interpreting what they mean. What we did was we followed the schematics from up there and said, I want to find a solution of x equals be so if I if an ex was the first I have a solution X  In reality, there is no solution.  Okay, so if you start a phrase with  Without an antecedent. That is false.  Okay, if it is Saturday today, I am named Bob that is a true statements because it's not Saturday today and that's what happened here. So let's look at that more closely.  So as I said we started with this system, we want to solve ax equals B.  We want to follow the great school algorithm and find a 1-over a 2 x so we want to find a sea so that c x a is the identity Matrix. I'm just about the size of the things are going to have to be because it was an n-dimensional Vector ex is an n-dimensional Vector. So if we want to multiply something by X going to have to be at the End by a  In order for this to even make sense if x equals CB that is a logically true statement.  But we really wanted was the converse of that statement. We wanted to know if there's a solution critical points of critical point. Annex equals c * B. That is true. It's just that before the implication sign the first part of the F statement is false. And so the conclusion can be false as well.  Now suppose that we had a c that we could multiply a on the right.  Identity Matrix here is a really different property suppose that a has a right one over the inverse moment supposed to be thick. Well then.  ax equals c x v  2 ax equals by well, we can just check it.  We want to know if this is a solution. So let's just check that. It's a solution.  Is equal to AC but AC is the Matrix.  so  And that is the reverse implication.  Okay. So let's check again. We knew something went wrong in this example from the last slide. So let's check again what it is.  So we saw that the matrices here the one we started with the a matrix from the last slide was the tall one this one and this was The Matrix T and we saw that and see that's the important Point here as we see here if if a solution  Now the size of this Matrix is bigger.  It's a 3 by 3 Matrix. Now. The first entry is 1 + 0 * that column that row by that column. So there I get one.  What's the next one down?  Let's do this one.  And that's going to give me 0 + 0 looking good so far and then the next one down is 1 + 0.  This is not the metrics and if we fill in the rest we find this.  This is not the appropriate size identity Matrix.  So eight times is not the identity.  Okay, so there's a huge subtle to hear matrix multiplication is not commutative Elementary grade school type of approach is not the best approach but we're going to push this little further because sometimes we really can make it work. Sometimes a CNC a will both be at work.  So let's get some language going on here for now and actually will see forever. I'm going to restrict to the case metrix.  suppose a is an N by n Matrix  we call such a matrix.  Yes following we did on the last to see if there is a c satisfying CA.  And AC are both the identity Matrix.  Okay.  And in that case we did note this Matrix. See we call it. Not one over a we call it a ^ -1 which is another symbol notation. So we use that for matrices and Matrix that has this property that we are both inverse is invertible.  All right. So we saw on the last slide that there was in a non Square case without with a matrix a where there was a season.  But that sea did not satisfy AC is the identity. Okay. So in that case  When is the Matrix going to be invertible? How can we tell when can we expect this to happen? Well, let's think back to the implications that we saw on the last slide for that. We saw that you know, if there is left if there's a c that I can mow plan the last to get the identity.  Then we get if I have a solution. It's given by c x b.  Suppose suppose that I know there is a solution that might not be correct. There might not be a solution. So what this tells us is if there's a sea that you can multiply on the left to get the identity.  The situation where we know we have no or one solution.  has a matrix of a one-to-one linear transformation will get it's all of those things later, but  So that's right direction that we just made so here were talking about uniqueness of the solution uniqueness. So  is there  At most at most one solution for each B.  for any given B  That's the uniqueness question.  and what we just observed is that this  is equivalent to their being  a c on the left side of the identity. And by the way, remember we have a mechanical way using reproduction to check is going to be at most one solution.  Bydureon rubber duction. What's the thing you look for?  Are you guys all got this right on the midterm yesterday many many of you almost all you got it, right? So you should feel confident telling me right now. Yes.  Great. Guess all the columns are pivotal.  So this is actually how we can tell if we have a c on the left if you can x a c on the left.  Okay, let's look back at our example from the first slide. There's r a  are all of its columns pivotal.  Well, we could do one step a row reduction to check but we can also use a theorem which tells us that all the columns are pivotal. If and only if all the columns are linearly independent that was questioned to see on the midterm yesterday and example, which actually was one that you had trouble with.  The Columns there are in the independent when you have two columns, it's easy to tell you look and see if they are parallel those two are not parallel and therefore a dog have all columns pivotal serum that I'm saying that they're having a left inverse is the same as having all columns pivotal.  Okay, but now let's look at the other way around the sides too much but hopefully download.  Let's look at the second one here supposed to be a x.  That's e x b was a solution is a solution. Particular solution, but that doesn't mean it's the only solution.  Having a c that you can multiply on the right. Okay is the same thing as being questioned is the system consistent.  for every B  No matter what. Do you put there at least one solution?  And that we just saw is the same as finding a sea, you can multiply on the right to get the identity.  Right inverse Matrix. We saw the beginning of the lecture doesn't pass.  Is the same thing?  As the system being consistent equals be being consistent.  Those are the two paradigms here verses on to having having at most one solution for everybody.  And now we have another condition for those which is having a left hand versus left inverse versus having a ride Converse and finally the very first condition from the beginning. How do we check mechanically using the system is always consistent.  If all rows are pivotal.  Okay, guys.  now we have a serum just proved rigorously a serum and the serum is  That a is invertible.  if and only if  all rows columns  are pivotal  and now you see why we're only talk about columns.  You can only have at most one pivot pero and four column. So there's only three columns. You can't have any more than 3 pivots, but if you got for at least one at least one in order for it to be even possible for there to be every row and every call him Thibodaux.  The Matrix must be square that doesn't mean that every Square Matrix is invertible again don't reverse that implication. This is another thing that we need to keep running by on our heads cuz it's okay and we make sure that we understand all statements.  I just said that if a matrix is invertible, then it must be square. That doesn't mean that if a matrix is square. It's invertible. If it's raining then that's a true statement implications go One Direction only typically mechanical.  is we look at the reduced row Echelon form of a  and find that it's the identity Matrix. Must be the registration form if we're going to have every row and every call him Thibodaux. So there's our condition. Now, we know how to check if a matrix has an inverse if a matrix is invertible at all.  Okay, so I'm just restated that on this life once again, so if it's soluble for any  That is the same thing as every row pivotal.  And if it has at most one solution for every B. That's the same thing as every column pivotal As We Know?  and therefore a inverse exists  if and only if the reduced row Echelon form of a is the identity Matrix.  examples 1/2 1/4  Is every column pivotal we can look at it by looking the second column is not the first there for about every row same deal to 4 is not a multiple of every road there is pivotal so that Matrix is going to be invertible. And actually I've pulled out of thin air what the inverse is. Here it is.  Let's do the multiplication. I get 2 + -1 is 1 - 1/2 + 1/2 + 0 I get to * 2 - 4 + 2 x - 1/2 which is -1 + 4 * 1/2 - 1 + 2 is if I call this Matrix a and this once we just we went through a whole lot of trouble because 2 - 2 0  -1 + 1 + 0 + -1 + 2 is 1 it does work so that one is invertible.  Okay now.  Now, let me go back and say actually we didn't need to check here. That sounds like it contradicts what I said before but we have a serum up above that. We actually proved on the last slide which is a square Matrix is invertible. If and only if every row and every column is pivotal.  Okay, we already know that this Matrix is invertible. We already know there will be a see that works on both sides. And since we found it works on one side, it automatically works on the other but that's only for square matrices. That's the caveat here by 3 by 3 1.  This one it's again easy to tell just by looking.  That every row and every column is pivotal. Okay, just make sure it's is already almost in reduced row Echelon form if I would have carried a 1/4 Mile by the second one by 2 in the third one by 3. And then I have the identity Matrix and that was our condition. So I know this Matrix is invertible. How do I find the inverse? Well, when once more I'm just going to pull out of thin air how this works and then we can double-check it in this case. It turns out that if you have a diagonal matrix like this one, meaning of that the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal then it's inverse is easy to find you just take the diagonal matrix.  And if you go ahead and work this out, I'm not going to do all 9 multiplications. But certainly the first one is 1 + 0 + 0 Let's see that the one below that is 0 + 0 + 0 son. I'm doing now say This One X that one guy gives me this entry and that gives me 0 + 0 + 0 + if you feel this all yourself.  You're going to see that you get the identity Matrix.  invertible Matrix  Then it'll be invertible provided provided. It has a pivot in every row and column. This procedure wouldn't have worked. We would have had to put a 1 / 0 there does not have it will not be invertible an inverse to find.  Okay.  All right. Now let's talk very briefly about relation to linear Transformations. I already said this out loud earlier. So remember that we have a linear transfer. We have a matrix we can think of it as a linear transformation given by multiplication by that.  and we already had some different language for the same concept from talking about solvability has a solution for every v formation is on to  Ax equals B has at most one solution for every B. That's the same thing as saying that the transformation is one to one.  And as I commented before if we have a left inverse the seagulls on the left. So having a left inverse means that t is on too and that's the same thing is every row pivotal pivotal concepts are just the same ideas using different language. The transformation is invertible or has an invertible Matrix.  If and only if it is both one-to-one and onto their lots of examples, for example, any rotation Matrix is invertible. Guess I was thinking in terms of functions in terms of Transformations invertibility means that you can go back from y 2x. It's an invertible function invertible linear transformation.  Okay, so I'm I'm not going to linger on this slide because it just says one more time. I'm just writing things over and over you can look at this again using slightly different words that mean the same thing here is that an a square Matrix is invertible meaning that it has all columns and all rows pivotal meaning that there are n Tibbetts and leaving entries in their distress. Landform. Landform. Is Matrix inverse.  Okay.  And therefore the more lies and this is one of the most important theorems of Matrix algebra. If you have a square Matrix remarkably, you do only need to check if it has an inverse on one side. Cuz if it has an inverse on only one side has an inverse on the left like at the first example we did today that implies that Solutions are unique if they exist.  Okay, and that means that the lady transformation is one to one that means that every column is pivotal. But if it's a square Matrix if every column is pivotal, then every row is pivotal to and therefore its and therefore it also has a right inverse. That's an important remarkable theorem that matrix multiplication always commute in the special where you have the identity Matrix coming out as the product if you have square matrices  Okay, I've not given you basically the entire story on how to check if a matrix is invertible what it means to be invertible and so forth. The most important part is how you find the inverse if it exists, but that part you already know believe it or not.  Okay, so not all square matrices are invertible again.  But supposing it is invertible and we can check that production. How do we find the inverse?  But remember what it is we're looking for. What are we looking for? We're looking for?  The Matrix C  Such that x c is the identity.  That was right that Matrix notation. So we're looking for the Matrix PCS.  What we're looking for is a solution of this.  Matrix equation, but it's a multi equation where the input and output are vectors there also matrices.  Some of you asked about that when we talked about Matrix equations and lecture for okay, and I said we get to it and here we are.  But it's really a repeat of what we've already actually asking for asking for x c.  Equal the identity Matrix and I'll write the identity Matrix in terms of its columns. Remember that it's columns are the standard basis vectors dh100  010  eventually down 20001  But let's remember how matrix multiplication works.  E x a matrix is columns are C1 C2. We just defined that to be the Matrix his columns RAC. 182 Down the Line.  So this is what we need. We need to solve 81 is equal to that First Column. What we need to do is solve Matrix equation Matrix equations.  That we write down the augmented Matrix to reduced row Echelon form. Now. We know that.  Right, that's the case were in here. And so when we carry it to register Echelon form.  The thing on the left hand side of the augmented column is going to turn into the Matrix and the thing on the right that's going to be our desired vectors. He won the First Column of the inverse and then we do the second one.  How do we know we'll get the identity Matrix here.  Well, actually that's pretty wasteful.  Because when I do the roloffs operations that carry me one too. I see one I look at the next system. I'm going to do exactly the same row operations. Cuz the row operations are just designed to convert a to its reduced row Echelon form. So I'm going to be repeating myself and X beef rice to the so what we're going to do instead.  We're going to put on the left hand side and we're going to put the whole identity Matrix, which is this E1 E2 E3 all together on the right side is meant by all of them together and do row reduction in parallel.  That will take us to well the identity Matrix on the left.  And a inverse on the right. That's ematrix. What should we know is we're not calling. That's how you find the inverse know if if it turns out well reduced to the identity Matrix. Well, then you're going to get garbage on the right hand side on the right hand side.  Okay, but when that happens and this is how you find the inverse and it's just doing row reduction in parallel.  I so let's talk briefly about the competition or complexity of this which is a fancy way of saying how long would it take some of you if I had just a regular old Matrix equation ax equals B Matrix with one column on the right.  Edmondson and Biometrics the number of flops the number of floating Point operations that computer needs to operations using them is about two-thirds and Cubed.  So for this system here.  How much longer does it take to do an of them all together in x 1/3 and cute which is 1/3 and 2 the fourth. Just getting longer in parallel. If you work through the calculation, it only takes 2/3 and Cubed flops in order to do this. So the computer can do that pretty much just as fast. So this is just repeating what I wrote on the last Light.  How do you find the inverse of a matrix if it's going to have an inverse at all? If it's invertible? Well, the multi augmented Matrix identity Matrix on the right and columns on the right option when you get on the right hand side. Is the inverse Matrix? So let's finish the lecture here by doing that in one special case in one example, so he was the 4th slide.  I'm going to compute its inverse. I had picks its inverse. Let's figure out how I got there.  Guess what we're supposed to do.  Is take the Matrix itself on the left and add the identity Matrix as an augmented Matrix on the right and now we do row reduction. So the first step of Road auction I'm going to do I want to get rid of the second row of the first row from the second. So - Row 2 + Row 1 results in Row 2  But I have to do that to the Matrix K2 everything including both columns.  So that's going to give me  the desired 0 there is one there a minus one there and nothing happens there.  Okay, and now only one more step is needed.  now I need to subtract the  On the second row. Sorry.  are subtracting  Oh, I'm sorry. I am.  I wrote the wrong thing. What I did was I subtracted Row 1 from Row 2 in order to make this work, right? So I subtract and so I have to subtract to get 0 and get one down below this one. That's what I wrote. And I think this is cracked. I just wrote the wrong operation, but did the right operation. Thank you. Now. I'm going to subtract the second row.  From the first for the result in the first row in the first row. So that's going to give me my desired 0 there.  And what happens so I subtract -1 from 1 and I get to there and I subtract -1 from 0 and I get one there.  Okay. Now I've carried the left hand side to reduced row Echelon form and the right hand side is supposed to be the inverse.  Should be at negative 1 on it where?  Oh here is that?  Cuz I contracted the second row from the first.  Okay, now that is not the Matrix that I got before so let's multiply and see what happens when maybe we're making a simple error somewhere. Let's multiply 1 1 1 2.  * 2 - 1 - 1 1  SOB where we end the lecture we got to -1 is 1 - 1 + 1 is 0  2 - 2 + 0 + -1 + 2 is one actually this is the inverse Matrix and we'll talk a little more on Monday about what that means have a nice weekend and watch for that email from gradescope detailing the grades and what they mean.
