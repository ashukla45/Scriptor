Okay guy on but he decided to name me Hardy new computer architecture to we are almost in the same city publishing architecture conferences for some reason you couldn't make it today. So he asked me to talk to you guys about machine learning.  Do you guys know what machine learning?  Can somebody tell me what machine learning years?  Everybody knows but nobody can't talk about this. I don't think it's Lord Voldemort.  That's actually a pretty good definition except at the fact that you know, none of the machines that think they actually don't.  They just math. They are just simply mathematical engines that perform predictions on unseen data based on the mother that they extract from seeing date.

This is actually one of the real systems that we have built and we were able to you know, Ron real-time object detection using the hardware that we have designed rights on a drone on a flying drone as you saw it. But the basic based on a machine learning algorithm called if you are left are Loosely and I have to emphasize the word Loosely or inspired by the way. Our brains are computation. We still don't know how our brain does computation there. Multiple Tau no theories and your scientists are working on it. But we still do not have the idea of how information is actually represented in the brain. Is there a lot of dispute about how rain actually represents information I'm not going to get into that from my perspective. The current state of machine learning is a  Mathematical you know, which actually does a lot of mathematics of computation to give you a simple task and you are doing it right now. I'm looking at you guys and I'm detecting all the objects. I know where each of you guys are, you know where the chairs are the laptops and bear that, you know the cell phone so I can actually do you do even more I can look at your faces and I can gradually remember your face is right there an auto parts in order.  Let me go through this.  How long do I have until 2?  115 or 50  5 Xena  So I'm going to talk to you about how we can build hardware and systems to make machine intelligence fast. And why do I care about making things faster? The reason is that we have so much computation that we need to do.  Which movie do you need the laptop performance you guys doing about performance, right? Anybody knows about MEPS? What is MEPS?  Mips is million instruction per second is a is a measure of performance how many million instructions?  You can run in a single second, right and then you know a few things about the history of computing right back in 1971 when we built the first microprocessor Intel 4004. The cost was $5,000.  What do you think? It's cost is today.  I'm taking bets.  Penny's send when I did the calculations considering the inflation in 2013, it was three set.  Right, it's gone down from that time to your kind of a stagnating right now. But like, you know, the cost has gone down. I have any question. I'm everybody please shut down your you know, your laptops.  If you want you can leave if you are in the class, please listen to me. Okay, if you want, I'll give you a minute to leave the class. Otherwise shutdown your laptop.  Detroit scissors  When you go to a grocery store and you want to buy an egg.  Do you go and take the eggs that are broken?  You don't try you're paying for this education. You better listen to to a dry. Why do you want to get a broken egg from the side you cash.  What do you have done by building process? We have been able to push down the cost of computing which is measured in terms of performance, which is the raw material for your new computation performance. We can do more.  But there is another thing that we have to consider when we are thinking about Computing other than performance. What is the other metrics that you would think when you're thinking about computer?  Just had something.  I actually I can't hear you.  Prices are good point, but that's not the latest Proxes 4 price.  Nobody is important, but that's not a metric to measure computing.  How much your cell phone Consumers power?  Imagine the amount of computation that you can do with your cell phones and compare it to the amount of computation that you could do with a desktop 10 years ago.  Your cell phone actually passed more computation power than your desktop 10 years ago.  But your desktop require to be plugged into the wall.  But your cell phone you carry almost, you know all day around and it doesn't drain the battery power and energy conch.  We have reached an era and I hope you guys have heard of this phenomenon called. Silicon. I hope that you have at least heard.  Everybody has more hair.  Can somebody Define Moore's law for me?  Exactly more predicted that the number of transistors on each chip in 800 I is going to double every 18 months. He didn't talk about anything else. He just predict that the number of transistors is going to be 22334 mess. That's me food extract from the raw material, which is this.  On which we build the transistors, right? But back in 2004 something this kind of broke down.  NBA Store that we couldn't improve the performance of our process. Do you remember like, you know Intel Pentium they were running act like, you know, 700-500-1845 and lintel was telling us that they're going to build 10 gigahertz processor. I can't give you high frequency. I'm going to cut and paste and I'm going to give you a multi-course you're going to get to court then you're going to get exact horse and it's going to go to Towson. It's never happened you're running is still on for coarse what happened is that we were not able to improve the performance of  therapist Trust  I got the multi-core Frank gave us Elizabeth. Everybody was excited. I'm going to get to Coors and things we have reached an error that may need more computation 20 by 220 pixel. It's not even  SD. Let alone HD not even close to 4K. Just you want to look at 2:20 and say what is this in. Photo? You need and 150 billion Oakridge.  You need to bring it on 500gb.  Ab machine learning model onto your tip.  To be able to discern whether or not in that picture. You have a cat or a dog or a duck.  make sense  That's why Google went ahead and built their own Chef call tensor processing unit.  Anybody knows what tensor is?  It's just a fancy word for multidimensional arrays.  The whole idea is that if you want to do computation with machine learning, you're always performing computation a multidimensional arrays in mathematical terminology. These are called Michigan physics days are called tensors in mathematics think they called hyper dimensional vectors.  Because you can't have more than two Dimensions. So I hope to be able to provide better services for you guys.  You know, why don't ya plication Savage you have Google home Alexa?  Cortana  opposed it city right? I hate it.  She never understand my accent. I don't speak proper English. So she's just I don't know but I blame her anyways.  Let's get to it. Let me give you a little bit of a glimpse of what we are doing the video today about I open source. You can actually go download and implemented on fpj's everybody knows what fpga is are.  This is the first time we're here here in your boss if peaches.  WhatsApp  Okay. Great. FBG is our short for field programmable gate as they are literally oceans of gates. You guys know what dates are right and Santosh that you can actually design a hardware for example of a process and program it on the LPGA and then you can run your coat on the first day that you will have Ron you have design you have implemented and actually interface with the word. That is what we designed a machine learning processor.  And implemented on a field programmable gate array these algorithms list machine learning object detection on the process that we have design and Implement in January. I moved from Georgia Tech. George to take the stairs of the south of France Computing Center. And those are my students from Georgia Tech. These guys are the new kids that I'm playing West in UC San Diego. They're doing the hard work and I get to blah blah blah.  Let's understand that we are living in a new era at which I actually upset students for asking them to close their laptops and you are very eager to get out of this, you know, this class so that you can play with yourself. We are at the air of ever-increasing connectivity. In fact in the world the Black Friday. I bought so many smart things in my house, right?  And what is. Give me a tremendous amount of data in the one minute that I have been blabbing about smart things about 2 million. Facebook login has happened 56 million email has been exchanged.  What half a million tweets have gone up maybe some of it is from the president in the history of erased.  our species  why we did not have this amount of digitized data going around saying that I'm talking to you guys. My Fitbit is measuring my steps and it's coming into my cell phone and my cell phone is connected to their you know, if a potato centers which is collecting data across everybody who is wearing Fitbit and they can the hope is that we can extract the insides we can actually determine which is reality now whether or not I'm going to have a heart attack in the next 20 minutes or not.  Black based on what you know how I walk.  And so this unprecedented amount of vegetation, you know, making the date a digitized right has given us an opportunity to provide.  targeted  Any specialized services for each person?  Amazon is it still a little bit down, but then you go and buy some things did he you know Amazon she starts giving recommendations that you should have bought. This one. I would have liked to know that before I bought the other thing dry. So we want to get to that point that you know, the services can synthesize knowledge for us and give us the recommendation instead of telling us that you know, you know, you should have bought this one. We should have bought that right. That's one example, if you are searching for example Google history by Facebook abuses your data dependency. I don't know there's something going on there.  Let's look at the you know, the real strength. If you look at this graph the x axis or the years starting from 2008 is gross normalized to the year 2008. The bars are the projections how much data?  Users are going to generate and the life is based on a paper that I published in 2011 and was providing your times and it's the most highly cited paper from a Witch Project how much performance Improvement we going to get from general-purpose process?  If you see the 2018 we have a tremendous job in terms of how much performance we can provide and how much data this guy is actually achieving in an exponential map.  What happened?  Something didn't go right.  So we need to close this performance Gap, but I can ask you to carry a power plant with you instead of a battery and tell you that I can solve all the problems in Universe with the computer that I'm giving you a way of the end. It doesn't matter where it says right I give you examples of mobile devices or Internet of things like home connect with you all of the data, you know today if you can save 1% of the data center energy.  That's millions of dollars.  That's so good for the planet.  I'll do if you don't know if there's a you know.  human-induced environmental change or something  designing general-purpose processors  I'm exposing a very unique abstraction to the software which is called instruction set architecture pop up desk instruction set architecture. I assume you know, what instruction set architecture. We have been able to provide a compositional.  Stock of computing where algorithm designers who designed their algorithms, then people who know how to do programming. They do programming some people develop.  some people develop operating systems  And then what we have done so far is that they have been able to maintain?  these abstractions  for some reason my  My Thang is acting up  Avis  unless everybody just to think about their own problems without thinking about the others right and then we have guaranteed for you to think. I'm going to run it on my laptop. It doesn't matter right? I don't care what algorithms you using. I don't care what kind of you know applications of programming languages you were going to use. Are you still going to be able to run it on your laptop or your cell phone makes sense? Also be provided this ability to give you precise repeatable answers whenever you ask me 2 + 2  My laptop is going to give me 4.  And there's no doubt about it, right?  We have maintained this abstraction of generality and precision across the entire.  Except for you know Microsoft PowerPoint apparently which you know behaves Galaxy City allows errors happen in Precision to happen during their computers, you know is what you said.  And by doing that I have been able to reduce their power consumption. I'll give you an example.  I do a lot of Instagram friends see, you know, it's still used but you take a picture.  You make it Scrappy.  Are you posted online and that company sold for 1 billion dollars?  Why do I need to  When I'm actually converting the images on Instagram and applying the filters on it. Do you know what you're going to get out of each filter?  But if I would you know, you might even think this is a feature. It's not a you know it but it gives me head room.  To save a lot of energy wouldn't you like to have a device? That doesn't let you know that doesn't work like this. Actually you're not lost me to do.  forward progress instead of going back  So that's one of them.  Allowing Arrow to happen during competition. Okay. I'm not going to talk to you about it today. I'm going to talk to you about an algorithmic approach to accelerate machine learning. We want to run specificity machine learning algorithms faster because if he can run them faster you can have devices that you can talk to you can roll. If you can have robot that can come and do your work. I would love to have a robot which dreams my kitchen counters.  But let's depart with machine learning it.  Are there multiple groups of machine learning algorithms today? I'm going to talk about one of the most important ones which was called supervised machine thing idea of supervised machine learning is how you actually teach addition to kids.  You show them you have two opposing right-hand. You have two offers on the left-hand. You put them in the basket. How many apples do you have?  You say for what you do you say you have inputs.  You have a golden outfit, right? And you say forgiving these Imports. This is expected out and you provide multiple examples of strikes you talk to about oranges to not just a pose. Let's be fair. Okay, and by observing these examples and the relationship between the inputs and output. Actually there's a mother  Which me later on call it addition to machine learning models do the same thing. We have two phases one is called the training face in the training phase be present training data, which is labeled samples of the reality which means you have input and you have golden outputs that you respond to those inputs and the Machine learning extract.  A model from this and now you can use that mother and apply unseen data after a kid, right and then you get British. That's what we call machine.  What they have done in our work is that we have actually accelerated makes these faster and less power with less power consumption.  So  this might be a little bit too much but I have to tell you this. You're now because the amount of data is so big right now. We cannot just have a single computer a single note in a Datacenter or a single node in any kind of setting learn a proper model.  Listen to something real so what do you usually do? Is that the partition or training data across multiple multiple nose and multiple computers and develop Solutions like Apache spark. Have you guys heard of a cheese park or not two years ago by tensorflow is another one which actually came out from Google. Do you know a few years ago Facebook is kind of pushing pushing you to give you a distributed environment that you can program a new Partition and a lot of people use these environments to do machine learning because data is baked and you can't hold it and process it in a single.  at the same time  anybody completely destroyed effort people have been trying to design these specialized Hardware's that you can't just run any program and run on these specialized Hard back, but you can drive on  Machine learning algorithms the ones that are reading MAD I give you an example, right? For example iPhones bionic check from you know from Apple is a specialized Hardware which is designed to run neural networks the kind of which we actually ran for the object detection on the Drone specialized Hard brexit is just design  To run these kind of August right after it happened. What is that? We developed a computation to start a program, and computation Hardware architecture unit off a compilot everything that you can imagine run time.  to run machine learning algorithms  Any specialized Hardware, which is embedded in distributed systems.  I'll give you an example of Microsoft Azure now have a BJ's which you know, you can use to implement, you know, specialized Hard Rock at BJ's to Microsoft Datacenter Amazon AWS. You guys know what about about Amazon web services, you can actually a cloud from Amazon before, you know for Amazon the lots of that, you know applications. That's how you know cloud services for you even games that use Amazon web services Google developed their own specific chip for just machine learning call TQ. And they are they have announced that they are inversion to but then they say we are in version 2 version 3  So and listen to yesterday Amazon announced that they have built their own ship with Hardware so much. I think I'm crazy.  Bart most of the companies that used to be softer only companies, right, you know right now are moving towards developing their own sexual downstairs chip, you know, very soon. That's my privilege, right?  Google doing the same thing he's doing the same thing like the bionic chip is designed by 4:10 to get for the future of that funeral.  Future Wicked. Okay.  Doors as we did actually is called scale at acceleration for machine learning. I have to Define two terms for you guys. Do you guys know what is scale out?  Skate off means. You take one note. You add more notes that's called scale.  Okay, Wynonna Computing. You scale it out to multiple sources example and you add more close to it. That's what he wanted to do is to provide this infrastructure so that you can instead of setting you can ask machine.  We have to address three different challenges. We have to figure out how to distribute machine learning algorithms and yet provide oxidative design a customizable accelerator that can this is a specialized process that can run machine learning algorithms and also because we are running in this is Caleb distributor setting me how to reduce the overhead off communication between them because now I'm working on multiple, you know.  We need is a Computing staff. You guys know what the Computing stock is Right application programming compiler, you know reading system architecture Denmark's architecture circuits transistors Adams design our own specialized Computing star, which comprises a programming language I left and we would give you the second and the software that can run on this, you know.  We call it Cosmic Computing stock for machine learning acceleration in the clouds.  This kinda shows the complexity of the stack that we have designed. I can't go through all of it obviously today, but I'm just going to give you a little bit of a glimpse of how we actually came up with all of these components in the you know in this stack.  Challenge that I mention is that how do we provide a an abstraction a programmable a structure that allows us to distribute machine learning algorithm. Has anybody of you guys written any program for distributed fat?  When I say writing programs for distributed password, do you think that is an easy thing to do?  It seems like you're very gruesome task to do actually, if you asked me to write a program for a distributed environment, I would cringe a little bit first.  Try writing a program event for the single know this hard. Let alone you want to do it in the distributed environment. I'm going to show you that we have designs. You can actually use it right now. Okay, but how did he do it?  WWE event after the system design and that's what I'm advocating right now. So for you guys to also understand if you are interested in systems.  Instead of saying that I don't want to know anything you bought machine learning course. I told these I was with him. We said no glue and understand it Foundation of machine learning that people are talking about.  It's not Black Arts, right? It's something scientific going on. Somebody came up with it, right and  Hopefully we're not leaving until you know, Middle Ages that people used to sell snake away is everybody would you buy it? I'll let see what is happening when it comes to machine learning model. That's the most important thing that you want to train your mother to be able to do something a collection of data set. This is actually divided into Parts. You have a vector which is the input for example and image is a vector the suggested two-dimensional vector.  And the ultimate table is. Orchard, right?  And then you assigned a number and ID to dog cat in a chair person that would be the golden of that's becomes the training data the same example, as I said to Apples to Apples on the other hand, you put them together you get for the apples are there in perfect collection of these which constitutes you training data. You have a machine learning algorithm that you want to try. Each machine learning is defined by toothaches a transfer function which defines the hypothesis space.  That you are thinking that it takes I'll put it on I'll give you an example. You guys have done physics experiments dry you have measured, you know, for example current and voltage. I'm from that you insert the amount of resistance. That's a resistor have right? What do you do you do linear regression?  So your assumption is that the relationship between the current and the voltage is linear that is your hypothesis.  space that is the transfer function definition  The second thing is that the parameters of that transfer function when you're actually looking at this example of voltage and current.  There is one parameter that you want to find, you know a priority that when you apply voltage zero you're going to get current little and that's what you're going to get dry. So the line actually is going to go through the origin make sense.  So what department are you looking at to get get from the data is the slope of the line that's called the parameters of the machine learning. It doesn't matter if it is deep neural networks or is the simple algorithm that I just told you we nearly Crush so you want to discover these parameters by knowing the examples in the training makes sense.  So what you do, you take your mother you randomly initialise the parent flyer to the machine learning model you get an outfit called. Why didn't you come to the golden outfit?  You compare. To the golden out what that you have in your exam. For example, you show literally you show two apples and two apples to a child and see how many apples when they when I put them together chances five for mistake. You gave me one more than I need the answer, right? So you actually literally calculate the difference between the output that you're generating from the mother and the golden.  In your training this difference is called loss punch.  Right. So then you calculate this loss over all the elements that you have in your training data, right? So if your mother was perfect.  If your mother was genius, what would be the value of this loss punch?  Show impact while you're doing training you're trying to solve an optimization problem. You trying to find the parameters of them, although in such a way that the Lost function is minimize. It's close to zero. Am I making sense?  So as I said at the beginning machine learning is not magic, as you said, it's just trying to extract and mother from the danger. It's just optimization. How do you find the minimum of a function? That's what is machine learning things that you see these days in terms of talking to phones during object detection.  All is this finding parameters in such a way that the loss is minimize. How do you minimize a function?  OK Google  tell me what is gradient descent.  That's that's that's excellent. What do why do we use granions?  Because whenever you wanted to find him in high school the minimum of a function, what would you do?  directions to calculate the gradient  You know put it to zero and any point that makes the guardian zero that's when you have any point the best way to optimize a function.  Is to use gradient descent from Yolanda mini Shell Point you start walking.  Try in the opposite direction of the gadget. And as you walked in the opposite direction of the gradient, you're very likely to find Optimum if your function is convex convex means that you have only one Global Optima Point non Commerce functions have multiple optimum points in those cases you're guaranteed to  You know find one of the optimal points not that global.  I'll give you an example of how Guardian sport should I if there is a food source over there and I have a fish swimming.  If is the fish wants to find a food source.  Which direction should the fish swim?  It should swam toward the direction to smell increases.  Isn't that the opposite direction of the gradient of the smell is an ocean of change?  try the fish minutes swimming right is trying to find the direction which actually  increase as the change in smell dry to increase asthma. So if I find that then I'm going to find her food. This is actually a an algorithm that is used to find light sources to find food sources.  So if I have the last function, then I can update my promises gradually in the opposite direction of the Dragon. There is a parameter here you see this is the gradient of the last function. This is called meal or you breakfast called learning rate the speed that you descend upon the, you know gradient reaction upon the opposite of the dude. It's called learning French the rate that you are actually learning from each example.  so  I hope I have convinced you guys to see if I want to Train Your Mother.  The only thing that I me just to gradient of the last match.  If I know the gradient of the last function, I know everything about the machine learning model.  because that's the only thing that I have to  update my timer to Swift.  So what I'm trying to say to guys is that I actually doing you don't need you to go and Implement machine learning algorithm from the only thing that I want from you is the mathematical representation of the Lost.  Is that I can actually Define a new abstraction between hardware and software and I called it the sgdh search.  Instead of telling you that compile your program. Give me the binary in x86 or are you no instruction set architecture.  I'm going to just tell you just give me the garage until the last month. I don't need anything. I don't want you to buy chocolate.  I only want that the mathematical mathematical formulation of the gradient descent. I can generate code that runs on CPUs. I can actually generate code that runs and you know GPS and I can actually generate specialized Hardware that's wrong these kind of algorithms very efficient.  right  and I can actually distribute this across multiple note without you knowing what I'm doing.  So this is kind of a different way of thinking about system designed right to Hugo understand the mathematics of the algorithmic, you know how girls Champs that you want to design systems for and based on, you know, mathematical representation and properties who designed the system and provide abstraction. I have to  If you look at this, you know this graph and think about what I'm doing, I have a current set of parameters make sense.  I'm going to apply one training data. I'm going to update my mother in the opposite direction of the track at I'm going to get a new set of parameters. Then I'm going to get in and then update my mother take the next procedure.  Don't you think so I need the previous Junior update to show that I can do the rat, you know current update. So, how am I going to paralyze?  This doesn't seem like very paralyzed and how can I actually run it on multiple, you know how to do this he or she is a mathematical genius.  The good thing is that the gradient the operator, which actually calculate the gradient is a linear operator what that means is that if you are calculating the gradient over a collection of data points, you can go calculate each gradient an individual data point.  an average citizen  And your mathematically guarantee that you're going to get the same answer?  What does that mean?  That's it really tells me that if I have a big dataset.  I can't partition this dataset put it across different notes.  Tell each note to calculator on dragons and then after they can send that to another note that brings them to aggregate steps to average make sense.  Wright's that's exactly what we did. We said we can Define two groups of note in a distributed system.  One of them we're going to call them sick mother was the other ones were going to call them what they do. They just talked to a partial partition that belongs to that make sense.  The sigma animals not only can do partial gradient calculation average results.  And after you've obviously results you can send the results back in Olden. What's Kansas view doing another situation over the date and as you move forward, what happens is that you find the parameters You're The Stupid Test. You said the cosmic program and he's supervised two things for us is the mathematical formulation of the Guardians of the last month.  That's this one.  second one  she needs to give us the aggregation function depending on how you walk over the data. You might want to address the results or you want my you might want to add the results together there different ways of walking over the data that requires different kinds of aggregation. So we allow you to express that function in a language and the language that we have designed has one-to-one mapping to mathematical formulations. Has anybody done Matlab programming?  Some of you guys have done Mass. Programming programming is close to mathematical representations, but it is not mathematical representation you defining linear algebra matter what we have designed here. Is that the way that you write formulas, you know, right? He's going to text you on Manor so it's like your program.  So you might think that I'm be a sink, but this me give you an example.  There's a technique called logistically Gratiot, which is trivalent flu used in Juneau Enterprise systems to do prediction and analytics their sigmoid. Sigmoid is tan H. You know what time it is right sigmoid is tan H 6 * W transport X I subtract from at why which is that, you know, the golden outfit that you have multiplied at 2 and then that's the formulation language that we have design.  You can see how you represents this mathematical formulation in our language song.  Take mind over.  Then the defense, you know the difference the abduction multiplication and formulation in our language. You don't even have photos.  You do their implicit for Loops. They are traitors or indices in group operations like 6 or big part to be provided for you know. Indices and its writers for you that's called a traitor and if you really look at this statement that I have here, there's some over i x i x, you know, this is a phone.  But I don't let you express it as a photo. Why do I not let you express it as a phone.  That's an excellent dancer in reality when you actually write a summation in a for Loop.  Yeah right for  That's how you write this, you know the multiplication right the summation is Sigma fish.  Is this a parallel operation or is it a sequential of fish?  It's extremely sequential action.  I have to always do one edition at a time one multiplication One Edition at the time and we can do it. But you and I know that that's not the only way that you can do. You can do what?  You can actually build a binary tree of others to implement the salvation.  And then you can actually run those additions in parallel and when you do things in parallel.  They go faster.  with the language of Elizabeth City  the wages of cheating is that it's still asking you to write you a program in a conversational language, which you going to be forced to write it in a sexual manner. There's no other way to write stop in any of our language. Is there anyway you can write some?  You can probably break it down Drive multiple for loops and things like that. But would you do it you would never do is try and then I have to do so many compiler gymnastics to actually understand that this  Is literally present represented at quality of address.  So I have that buy a new presentation the tree representation for this song.  That's if you want to do Norm you guys know what Norm is right? You must fight the elements and then you at the unit. You must buy the elemental, you know Western and then you add them together.  That would be there.  Do you know the tree that actually does. Computation?  So I have a question for you guys.  Do you guys know what a dataflow graph is?  Do you know how your programs get compiled and executed?  On your crusts. Yes.  Define your data inputs it just like one of the pack.  That's a good proxy for a formal definition. I'm going to actually switch gears now.  How can I  how old is it?  ham  wish I could.  I'm going to stretch cures to proper computer architecture course from there to 8 past execution.  The rate that we actually compiled programs.  You guys have heard of llvm.  Lldm is the C compiler that Apple uses that was came out from Vikram Advance group and University of Illinois. They actually design and now it's commercially used, okay.  Let's say I want an executive.  Erratic Behavior. I talked about the approximation and apparently didn't know the screen got excited.  Yeah, I'm sure I don't want to.  That way that's actually execute any program is that we take their program in compilot to an intermediate representation, which is called.  static  Van Gogh  at sign  call SSA.  Okay. What is an SSA SSA is a representation of a data flow graph.  How do you define a graph with a set of vertices and set up edges vertices are the operations?  Play example if you look at that, I have an addition.  I have a multiplication.  Then I have another addition.  And then I have a division.  These are  vertices are the notes in an eighth of a gram.  The angels are they dependencies between these operations?  thank  death goes here. And then I guess. I hope I got the prior to strike.  If I didn't don't think about it.  What are these the edges are the dependencies between the operations?  between the instructions  How do you actually Express dependency between operations in a program?  You guys have written, you know mips assembly code or you have seen it, right you use registered you say my dad is going to read from these two registers and I'm going to ride to that register Now application dry is going to take Dad's register.  Drive and multiplied with another register and write it to another day. Literally when it comes to a data flow graph. The edges gets the edge. Skip.  two registers  The operations are the ones that you actually execute in the process the same goes.  For machine learning algorithm the program that you have written.  Now I can switch back.  Now I have to.  Town Hall, okay.  So we got that dry. The nodes are the operations. The edges are the dependencies dry. So let me just go back to  what I had  these are actually dataflow graphs of Sam Horn or or a segment on a multiplication any of these statements that you have in your program and I convert it to the date of representation of that statement.  And then as I walked through the program, I'm generating the date of a graph that represents your program. This is what they text me SQL your python quote anyting and compilot.  Troy dataflow graph and then now you can actually executed any  any machine  Any specialized Hardware? It doesn't matter.  or even a CPU  make sense  show me how to sell fisticated compiler which actually Mobsters to an architecture which looks like that.  The architecture that we have design for machine learning is a massively parallel.  Yeah.  unbelievably simple hard drive  It is a two dimensional array of PE PE stands for processing engine.  Right, and he's processing engines perform the computation.  Why is the memory interface actually feed them date and today's processing engines?  You guys know what is multi-threading?  multi-threading mean statues Ron multiple  active programs on the same park  for example, if you buy a laptop these days they have four course, but when you count the number of processors you see 8  the reason is. On each core. You can draw on a track in Hardware terminology Chad is a running program.  Which has an independent program calendar?  Makes sense and who invented simultaneous multithreading?  Dean Tulsa the chair of your department  Okay, so we actually extended the concept to machine learning accelerators and we can run multiple sets of Guardian calculation on the same Hardware by allocating these frosting engines to multiple checks. Okay?  These processing engines are connected to each other.  Some of them in when you look at the roles, they have neighbor to neighbor communication. They can actually talk to each other. There is also a common database that allows them to talk to each other if they are not neighbors and this, later boss actually connect that connects all of them together through at 3 bus connects the two rows first and then the rose from the Frozen dead rose from the rose. And that's how you get connectivity today. You're now to defrosting engine so that you can actually you know  I talked about the processing engines, but I didn't tell you what they are. Right. This is what they are.  They're literally and are you in a 5-stage pipeline?  To each of these processing and we don't even have, you know, Bryce predictors or anything like that. It's just an Anu  A lookup table which we call it in a linear units you remember invite formulation. I had tan H signal. Signal is a nonlinear function. It looks like that the way that you would Prosper is actually in cement, you know, these kind of mathematical functions is to Taylor expansion. You actually a series of computation and you get to that point, right?  Goodbye, but here we just give me the X. I'm going to let you know in Dexter to look up table and give you the why for those kind of you know, but I'm just going to skip over some of the details. I'm just going to show you a few examples.  In the ghetto in the five minutes, I hope to show you how I actually deep neural networks work, right? We actually ran a set of benchmarks. That's what you do to make your major benefits from one of them is actually a Netflix recommendation system that gives you the Commendation. I don't like the good news. Is that tr20x faster, but let's skip over that.  Let me talk about John's. If you want to know about Thrones, you can come and talk to me. We do a lot of system design for robotics. I'm just going to show you.  A trait that we used to be able to run massive amounts of computation that deep neural networks requires that you can do object detection. You can do voice recognition. You can do all sorts of crazy things.  So, please keep your left work.  They perform.  Most of their computation if you look at this table, these are different kinds of different letters more than 99% of their operations.  They don't do anything.  99% of the time when you're running an object detection of speech recognition is actually multiply and write the good news is that I've been I'm doing X usui multiplying two floating Point numbers together.  And I was in shock but no we have reached the point that the multiplications the operant. They don't need to be floating point. I can actually reduce their breakfast. So dramatic see that I can actually run and do object detection and all of those applications with multiplies that are taking two bits four bits one. That's these are two different neural networks. They say is 410 digit pattern recognition for writing digits. The other one is actually for categorizing images different layers of the computation that happens in the last day in the Alex net.  Is Apex the layers in between one of your friends is 4 bits the other a friend is one. That's okay. I can do all of these operations in just two bits.  So if I design an app, you know X, which only does it with multiplication?  I'm leaving a lot of food on the table, right because a lot of my competition is going to be the world that you know two bits.  Reset when you are actually doing multiplication. You can break the multiplication to lower bed with X. You can do that when you're doing multiplication 2 digit by 1 digit multiplication, so I will busy Hardware.  Which has only one bit by one before supplies.  And then if you're late or competition requires more than one bit, I will compose them together to get it and give you higher visits. It's gives us the performance of server Drake Jeep used which operates at 250 watt in less than a volt.  Just a simple.  Ikea right, which I assume that any of you guys could have come up with if you think about thank you very much "
