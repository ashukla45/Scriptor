Gary midterm midterms  Very well.  All right, Serena got there as quickly as I was hoping to have Barrel graded. I was hoping to have the distribution of grades and all that kind of stuff for you today, but that did not happen.  because of some  Google Sheets issue that I had.  so I'll have those up for you by Tuesday and  What are the distribution surprised you can serious? It also know sometime probably on Tuesday will release the grade sheets for the class will receive an email with a randomly generated number and then you can look at the grade sheet to figure out which grade is yours and I'll show you where you are in the class with your current greatest while your projected grade is.  We will some time before that. We are going to release the will release the  The grated midterms on gradescope. If you have a question about your grade, I would like a re-grade then you can submit those through grape soda grade scope and you need to submit them by class on Tuesday. So you have until the beginning of class on Tuesdays to submit regrade request your grades go after that.  It's done. You're going to the midterms not going to change.  Are any questions about that?  Alright playing to go to the midterm. I'm pretty quickly if you have any questions raised your hand and I will and I answer them. So this was just the truth. There are two version of the midterm. There was a nice section to be section. They have the same problems in different orders on this is midterm a but that's exactly the same problems on midterm be so if he's in a different order a different numbers in your members, and that's that is why so few years that is true sis guy says typically have uniform instruction length. That is false.  Can I get a difference?  Strive enables fast Hardware implementation is true ideal CPI for a of a pipeline C2 smaller's Falls planning and reduces the time it takes to execute instruction is false Amazon only applies to Performance Falls performance equation of flies. Most of the risk is a haze.  false  CPI can never be less than one false.  By carefully designed is a suppressor mutation can affect all the terms of performance equation.

Paul will it be cool if they want to the deer lease shiny and when evaluating assume Amazon argues for focusing on the common Caseville ignoring the impact of income in cases false. I try to say they're good at spitting up operations on linked list false. Yes.  every what every 18 months  Yeah.  How is 8 / 3?  I will consider that fair question. Yes.  Farting can resolve all hazards.  Sorry, that's right.  Jay  call  Sorry, yes.  Quiet, please.  The instruction counts so you can design the is day and that will change the different the instructions you have. So the reduce or increase the number of instructions required.  Anymore questions. Yes.  I wonder why so I just said that you can affect the instruction count by how you design the I say so for instance if I had Vector instructions and I'll have fewer instructions than if I didn't have Vector instructions.  other questions  Yes.  They are the same.  Gabriel CPI for a pipeline CPU in a non pipeline CPU is volts one.  Because they produce in on the in the best-case they finish one instruction of recycle.  x86 between 1 and 15 instructions  Well, that's enough. I mean there's the vax instructions said it went between like 1 and I don't know how many a lot.  I know but I did talk about the characteristics of risk construction sets and I said they usually a fixed-length instructions.  It was in a discussion about Fisk and risk. I think if all the examples I gave you look that way than I think you could say. That's generally true.  next question  All Right Moving On  All right, give the phone off Randall's why no don't look at that.  What was that? That was your clicker scores? Uh-huh? Okay.  that's totally equals 1 / x / x + 1 - x  terms are  I asked tote s and X total speed up.  Speed up.  fraction of execution time  hankerson's on gnats  alright Farmers equation  Execution time equals I see time CPI times CT so itchy this is execution time. This instruction count cycles per instruction and Cycles cycle time over there any questions about that? Yes.  Well, you did it correctly. Yes, so some people wrote this.  Overclock rate or something. That was okay.  precautions  all right.  S&S code  so I'm  this is one.  Throwing number not one has not won.  73 + 18  So this Saturday that's cute. One time these executes four times each. This is 3 3 3 3 3 3 and the kitties are branches.  This is a load.  Are you getting this for your dad?  this is greater than or equal to so if it was different than they be all these these numbers are all one Higher if I think if you'd greater than or greater than  I'm so then we have tonight is the code. I'm not going to ride it out if you have questions about why I mean basically we looked at it.  And make sure it looks right and then the best case was 6 instructions.  I was sort of the shortest version of those someone I guess got five so good job by using some other instruction and basically the fewer instructions you had the more answer.  This was Mister Vista pended on what this answer was up here. So we didn't actually grade this because you needed all the numbers down here. So we just took whatever numbers you gave us here. And then we checked your math was right down here, right so that if you messed up this code, like if you miss optimize that you wouldn't get the wrong answer down here. So this is the original CPI.  For all of these you just take the so if the original CPI you take the branches times the branches you take the other should be aligned right there he take the memory time is the memory you take the l u x e l u and you take the average of those and I'll give you the CPI.  Then the same thing for your code the instruction counts calculated either in the first part of above and then you could use those two with the performance equation to calculate speed up. So that would just be CPI times. I see cuz those are the cycle time doesn't change in this problem and you take B  What's goes down here? Actually / c p i x i c for the old and the new and I'll give you the answer for total speed up.  So I guess you're on your on your test grade scope and make sure that that's the math you did and that you got the right answer. If you got there any of these gradescope is very nice for a variety of reasons. It's sometimes a little bit fuzzy. So sometimes stuff is not very visible. If you're sure that you did something right and it didn't show up in the Great's girl be just think I made a mistake during Semana grading request. We have all the hard copy. So I feel like it really says on the paper will go look at the paper and I will give you credit for that, but do go back and check the degrading.  So this is the ranch picture so this so the silver Branch won the first Branch with the one good predictor, we start off in the not taking State and branch.  One will continue to predict not taken forever.  I taken so it's consistently not taken until the end of this is not taken taken taken taken taken all the way out to the end. The actual sequence of branches for branch ones is no no no..... Taken. So this ends up being 90% accuracy. Could you get the last one wrong? Because you switched all of a sudden from taking to not taken because I was always saying put a 10 for the two bit predictor you start off in the  Strongly taken stayed so it actually says taken taken at the training time is it's learning and then it goes no no, no and then eventually it gets this one wrong to and so this one's end up being 70%  for branch to down here. It is taken forever. And it's basically taken until I close 10 and 4 one bit. This looks like not taken taken taken taken. To taken. So this is it's wrong here and it's wrong here. So that's 80% and for the two bit predictor, it just has taken taken taken forever. And then that gives it 90% because it's wrong then some of you missed the number of branches branches. So we just basically if you got the prediction right for the last and the first two then we said you we did the math and you got the answer right? Even if your percentage is Roth. Yes.  If you do if you read the question wrong, and then did the Run question, that means you probably got some point.  independent  All right angles law.  So this was what's the speed up? This is too far to handle a so we have low so  So the answer here, so we have 1 / x 1 / X1 + X2 / is 2 + 1 - X1 - X2. The equation. So x 1 equals 3 x 2 equals 2.5 equals 15  50% which is 2 m S2 equals 2 if you do all this.  Let's Get Set us toad equals 1.66 repeating  pretty much everyone got that one. The next one is what's the maximum possible speed up for the Edition unit. So the equation here is 1 / x / infinity.  Plus 1 minus fact. I'm here x equals 3 and that tells you that coach.  equals 1.43  turn all these questions on we did tell you to use animals law.  If you do not use handles laws in your license plates.  The last one is supposed to be. Oh you want to reduce the overall total run time by 30% you restricted in making changes to either the addition Hardware or the location. However, not both. Which would you alter and by how much to retrieve your color is impossible?  So  So if you just did the math and figure this out, but there is a sort of the limit the kind of limiting characteristic of animals law is that if I want to speed up program by 30% I need to choose something that takes up more than 30% of execution time. So that means it has to be what I say the addition to the addition instruction just can't do it because there's not enough then I still wouldn't be Michael supposed to do the math and I was fine just saw this.  We need we're going to solve for.  Sereno as tote so I stowed is 1 / 0.6.  since we're going to reduce overall run time by 30% that means  70s on 7 Minutes 1 / x / us and X we know is  .5. + 1 - 25 and then we're going to solve for that and this is 2.5.  FAFSA and speed up you need to get for the Edition instructions. Yes.  Oh, you're right. Sorry. Sorry, right, so it should be the X.  any questions  All right.  Scuse me.  All right.  Do you want to just the two defenses? So in this case we have a true dependents from  the add to the subtract  and we have a true dependents from the subtract to the load Word.  Henry dependents from the load Word to Deck Store.  and then you hear  set my garage on all the letters, but basically the subtract runs.  your blood word  run  how to hear  and the XR runs  and there's the the longer delay here is because of the the load delay.  for Arthur's forwarding  that's easier.  Gordon takes care of everything.  Dependent on the load because of the long delay slot.  and then the speed UPS  CPI for B is 1 + 3 + 3 + 2/4 equals 2.25.  and so one plus  three three  279 East this to the base case has one right? So this is one this is three because it should have ended right here and it went to farther. This one should have ended right here, but it went to farther than this one should have ended here, but it went one farther.  and then the CPI be  icpic is 1 + 1 + 1.  + 2  4 equals 1.2  if you miss the last arrow and you all and then everything was wrong after that and it was a whole cascading problem. Yes, so I would so this is like I would check and then submitted recoder Quest explain what you did so you submit the recreator quest be specific if it's like, I think I got this right. We're not going to probably grant that you need to say it like you did this sooner than I think I got the right answer so we know what we're checking for.  But I've had that will definitely do our best. Alright, this one was a victim of gradescope. So when we scan them all this blue didn't show up so that the key and all that stuff and all the flight gray stuff in shops of the solutions are almost illegible.  So, otherwise we regretted this part.  For correctness and then we started to this part on completed. So if you attempted and do some stuff and then  Not the right answer.  So this this one?  Ho Hey, Cortana  Go away, Cortana.  All right, and I realized I I don't actually have the key for this one. I'm not going to sit here and do it but we can go over this one next week if people have questions. Yes.  Do you want to consult load Word the one solution having issues logging into one of the execute memory right back, right?  Show the upper one. Okay, so this is  So dry on the the letters here, so this is fat fat.  Fetch decode decode execute memory right back the next one wait for the FED sets patch.  That's fetch.  decode decode  execute  Memory, that's all right.  What did I do wrong here? All right, there should be three because of here.  Decode execute memory right back fetch decode execute memory right back.  Why can execute because the  Oh.  I think you're right. I'll look at it as my tears and I will sit down and Ponder and if it's right, then we will go to accordingly.  I forgot to listen to problem. It was to fill in the second page of the Greensheet and nobody did it.  What the heck? Okay, so that's about that.  Overall people did reasonably. Well, there wasn't some people got perfect scores, which is a good sign like a friend of her people and then there was you no tail obviously, but I think it went pretty well any questions. Yes.  Which one?  The problem with this solution. Okay. So the problem is if there's no forwarding.  Yeah, I know for it.  AR questions  alright, so  the midterm is behind us.  The floor of the final is in front of us. So that's you know.  so  let's take a moment to consider Where We Are.  So far in this class we have studied.  We've covered two things. Really. The first thing that we talked about was I guess 3 so we we did a lot of review of instruction sets to get kind of nip back in your head or giving introduction to MEPS and then we spent a bunch of time.  We talked about performance measurement. So how would we evaluate performance or talk about Ambrose law and the performance equation and then those tools and set off to figure out how to execute a program and we saw kind of the Basic Hardware that you need to execute a program. We saw how we how instructions to execute another control password password forgot about a bunch of optimization. There were all about  I hope this is true.  Optimization to look at all three terms with a performance equation, right? So we looked at where you can reduce the number of instructions. You need the floating point if you're coming from and falling find hardware takes a lot to your instructions CPI, cause an increase in RCP. We talked about how to reduce the CPI pipe lining.  The first part of portion of the class all of the instructions that we were concerned with had their kind of CPI individual CPI. I don't know. I think the maximum was like 3 or something right for a branch or something that took a long time to resolve is going to really be just focused on one particular set of instructions. And in fact that they have on one particular term of the performance equation, which is the CPI turn in the instructions are interested in are the memory  and it turns out that memory is super important people who work in computer architecture are some of them are fond of saying that processors nowadays are nothing more than address generators, like all that they do is they generate the sequence of loads and stores at the memory system needs to process and that's  in some ways the performance of the car doesn't really matter what they really mean is that we know how to make processors so fast that they can generate they can generate memory operations way faster than the  Why don't I have my pen?  Way faster than the memory hierarchy can execute them.  Oh, man.  Last time I taught this class the number one complaint on my case was how broken my laptop was so I bought a brand new laptop.  And I'm afraid that it's also going to be the number one complaint of my cage this time.  She's going to be very sad. I don't know. I don't even know how to get I can't even see that window.  That's not a good sign.  I've lost the ability to write. Can I write in a white? Can I write?  Oh my gosh, I might as well use a Mac if I can't write okay.  Bill Gates Auto enable editing that's the problem.  Be careful.  The contents of the slide deck might blow your students Minds.  All right.  Excellent. All right.  Perfect. Alright with all that memory so that kind of conceptual outline of the class. So we wanted to know how she fuse run programs or talk a lot about that and now we're going to talk about some of this stuff. We're going to cover. This is Well written part of how the CPU does this is that has to do with the memory system. The operating system also has a lot to do with how the process that deals with memory and we're going to see kind of what technologies go into making all this go.  So here is the model of the memory system that we have been working with so far you appear to be a P4 and it hasn't memory. We said us to Memories instruction over and did a memory that I actually kind of the same.  Abstraction is that the program sees right isn't there just a big array of bytes. So I have some number in a register and I can say load and that number and it goes it looks in this Figure 8 by the contents of the slide that correspond to remember what the model memory can be really big this could be.  Potentially terabytes riding a big server in your laptop. It's like I think mine is 16 not this little  Pipsqueak, I'm podcasting. It release cramps my style. My big laptop has like 16.  But it's a lot right? So they're big big lots of memory. And the problem is is this is really hard to implement because it takes a long time to get an electrical signal from the CPU over to the memory has showed you before early on in the class. I showed you the CPU and then it's like this thing sitting here on a motherboard and answer the size of it. Are these big long cars in these are the Dems on a big server. There's like looks like a TIE fighter or something, right? There's Like These Wings sticking out on each side of it. And this is like, you know, this is like 5in or something, right? It's a substantial distance. And this means that like the speed of light delay, which is like the absolute best case that you can get is always an action reality. It's a lot worse because I have to propagate an electrical signal that is pretty big.  So the wires inside the the CPU that are like 7 nanometers now or 9 nanometers wide there super tiny, but the wires on the circuit board are like, I don't know. I know it didn't Mills which is super you slept thousand Seventeen just like six Mills which is like a 1.1 mm vs. That's like seven or eight orders of magnitude smaller and the bigger the wire the longer it takes to propagate a signal down here is a long way away in terms of time. And then once I get there, I will see you in a moment. I actually have to do some work to get the data out of here. So the whole round trip here is something like 60 nanoseconds or something.  An appointment at 4 if I'm at a 4 gigahertz machine which is at the high end today. But even your phones are running in probably one or two gigahertz, you know, this is you know at 4 gigahertz.  Gigahertz, this is 240 Cycles.  All right, so it's going to take 240 clock Cycles. At least for me to get the data out of my bigger right advice if I want something just like this play Destroyer CPI, right? The CPI is going to be in a loading start instructions or maybe 20% of instructions. So that means that you can divide this by 5, and it's going to be like the CPI is going to be  I don't know a big number. I can't do math 48. Thank you. Like 48 the first we don't give up we try to do something better. So important is a cool quote from John Von Neumann who invented one of the very first kind of modern notion of a computer and he actually lays out this idea that there's going to be this hierarchy of memories some of which are big and slow and some of us think of the CPU deram gap which is why why memory gets more and more important overtime. Sorry about locality, which is super important all different kinds of a bunch of a cat. Cashing so we can talk about how this works.  So here is the source of the problem. So this is a graph it ends a while ago.  In 2004, this would go up here and it's her level up like this and what were his performance and I apologize. I have one of my graduate students gave me this graph. I would I would give them some constructive feedback at the vertical axis is not very meaningful because I don't know what performance means is latency or bandwidth or whatever. This is probably wait and see if I had the gas but I'm not sure any case it doesn't make a lot of difference in case this is a log scale. This is normalized to 1980. So this is how much faster using gotten over that time. This is how much faster dear I'm just gotten over that time. So this this is basically linear the gap between these two is basically growing linearly, but it's a log scale which means that actually this is an exponential.  So relative to the speed of the processor is getting slower. It's been getting slower quickly and by this time, I mean, maybe it's tapering off a little bit but this guy is still big right that is this is also tapering off but this is still like three orders of magnitude or something, which is the factor of 1000.  But things have gotten pretty bad.  How to fix this before we talked about how to fix that. I'm going to give you a little bit of background about the memory technologies that were going to use their two main memory technologies that we use today in Silicon.  So what do you want us to destroy things are nice things in Silicon. So the first reason we chose silicon are the reason fast fast processors compatible with logic. So it's very easy to put some silica memory next door silicon processor. That's very convenient. So the goals with memory is the main goal of memory is to be cheap. So you want to have as much as possible in like to pay as little as possible to needs to be dance. That means we need to make the individual bits as small as possible. So we're going to go through at least a couple of structures and Hardware is 0 in silicone. I would like us to be as small as possible.  The way they were going to measure size is what this thing called f-squared.  So F squared is a smallest feature. You can create in a given process technology so back when I was in graduate school. We had the processors were built in 99 of technology and what that means is that the smallest thing that I could put on to a CPU the smallest little thing I could draw would be 90 nanometers on a side.  Right now days, I think until just released today.  We are at 9 nanometers. And so that means that the smallest thing that we can draw is 9 nanometers on the side.  9 on your side. So this is this is called the future size is the name for this like unit and so is technology gets better for the area of an F squared shrinks, right? It's going up Square now you now to meet her is like 80 100 square nanometers and in 9 millimeter, it's 81 nanometers.  What is true though? Is that the number of f squared for bit for a particular memory technology is basically constant. So this you know if I were so NS Ram salad 19 animator takes I think it's like we'll see I think it's like a hundred and twenty-eight f-squared and it still took 128 s squared and it's a lot smaller because the future sites went down but in terms of this a square number, it's the same. This is a device-independent measure of area for circuits.  And this is a function of the memory technology. Not the manufacturing technology. That's the key.  All right. So the questions we'd like to ask if we're going to build a silicon memory is first of all what quantity should be used to represent the one or the 0 so we could use voltage or charge. That's what is Randy reiman flash memories. Do we're going to talk about today at least two for ones and zeros, you can use the orientation of a magnetic layer. So you could use the crystal structure of a metal people have heard of Intel's 3D Crosspoint memory.  A few of your sew-in tell us about to release a new kind of memory. They're not saying what it is, but the consensus is that is a phase change memory. What they actually do is they have a little piece of metal flare metal actually and they have electric contact to the bottom and electrical contactor the top  And they run a whole bunch of currents from the bottom to the top. It actually melts the metal in between those two electrodes and then depending on how they arrange things. They can allow that metal to cool slowly or cool quickly if it cools quickly and solidifies into a glass East and if it cools slowly it crystallizes there different resistances, and they can they can store a bit using that  It's very cool. This is why one of the things that I study in research life, you can do the orientation of the Rings of carbon and buy if you arrange things populi properly, you can move one from one position of the other and you can detect atoms for a bit that way people working on that. All you need is something you can turn on off in some way that you can then convert that into a voltage so you can send into a digital circuit actually work today and then turn out once we know how to what we're going to use the store if you want to maximize density and they want to make them as fast as possible and there's going to be a trade-off between density and speed.  So this is how all memories work.  For the way to Memories work is you have you want to make them dance? And that means you want to have as many did bits as possible into a small an area as possible. So you need to make a little bigger a this is the big storage array.  And it's the the contents of these individual cells that varies between one memory technology and another array to be as large as possible because the larger it is the more bits and can hold and this other stuff. We're going to talk about in a minute. It's sort of sits on the edges and it's not memory. It's not bits. And so that's wasted area that's overhead the bigger the array the less of the overhead. We having a larger overall density that we get the challenges is that does this gets bigger? It also gets slower. So the distance across this there's going to be wires were going to see him at the run all the way across and all the way down the array and the length of those wires are going to determine in part how quickly I can access the contents of the array because I'm going to have to set an electrical signal all the way from one side to the other and all the way from the top to the bottom.  Been around that or I'm a big star Jay. We're going to have some other stuff. The first one is a row decoder.  And what this is going to do with it's going to take some of the address if you're going to come in here the hired of its are going to go into the row decoder and it's going to light up one row and we'll see what light up means in a minute and a Metro is going to get coffee down.  Through the sink top 10 say I'm still talk about in Romans and they'll actually stored in the sentence sort of and then the other the lower-order bits of the address was over here until the Colin decoder which switch vertical slice of the array to extract.  I am so that's how you access a particular set of particular word of memory inside the storage Ray Raymond Flash from real work. This way PC on also works in a similar way. All the details are a little bit different colors are pretty big but they are coming to take up a fair amount of area size as logarithmic in the size of the array so we can double the size of the surgery and the decoders only get a little bit bigger.  All right for density is King in the storage, right? These are highly engineered. So if you think about this, I'm going to build.  I'm going to build this huge array. I'm going to Stamp Out a million or probably a billion or more of these little tiny cells. So I'm going to pay some very very talented analog circuit designers to make him is dense and is highly optimized as possible because every 1% I say on the cell size translates to more density has to be big but the making a big make some sort of those wires that run across and down there on the order of millimeters long, which is really long for wires to delay for electrical engineer is large. So I'm going to take a while the row decoder has transistors and they need to drive a signal all the way down that those long wires, which also takes some time.  And then for the bed sales going to be as small as possible, but no smaller.  Very talked about density.  All right. We're talking a lot of squared.  Well, it's alright for the very useful piece of Hardware. So usually we think about the usual kind of ones and zeros are think about it electronics. Are there called single-ended and what that means is that there is a ground potential so is 0 volts that we know the way that you determine whether or not it's a zero or one is whether it's above some thresholds of the threshold voltage, which is about halfway usually between 0 never maximum voltage is above that threshold voltage at the one if it's below the Threshold at zero. So is that  If I have something if it is 0 and I want to raise it up to a 1/2 to raise it all the way from the low potential to the high potential and that's something like one bolt on modern modern memories as well. And we have these two long lines and have a large capacitance which means it takes them a long time to move so you can start driving at 1 on to them and the voltage will rise up slowly. I'll take a long time to get to that threshold voltage in a, one instead of a zero the same thing as turn on the way down to get to drive a zero. You have a high voltage in you drain the current off for drink the the charge off and we'll come down slowly if the capacitance is large. So the symptoms do they do this very neat trick instead of being single. I know they're called double ended and that means that they have to influence and what they do is they look at these two inputs and they say, okay.  What's a the input is above zero fencing? This is the sense of an amplifier. Did you run the two reference lines into the symptoms and it watches for this little tiny shift? And then as soon as it is constant of that shift takes those two guys to the rail got a really big powerful transistor that can drive a lot of current on that. I can pass items and get it to go up or down really fast cuz we're going to see is we're going to have these cells in our memory array and they are going to be able to cause a very small change on the output of these bit lines that run up and down in the sun. Camp is going to amplify them so that we can read them in a Digital Life.  So he's a really useful. They also are the basis for a how things like USB and pcie work and so forth. So now we need to look at our cell.  For the first time ever going to look at is called Static random access memory or S Ram.  So we're going to store the value of the voltage into cross coupled inverters inverters are sitting by themselves and we have you know, the opposite of this one goes into the back of this Summer's goes in to the back of the other one. And so these are sad and as long as you have to those inverters, this will sit there very stable e holding its value basically forever.  and there's a one and a zero and we're going to use both of those in a moment to read this what you do is you  Recharge the midline the deadline for the ones are in all the way down there, right you recharge the Beltline and all and all my group. My slides one is blue and 0 is 1 is blue and zero is red. And so the pre-charged is purple because it's halfway in between. This is basically halfway between 0 and 1 if you want to read what we do is we activate the word line. That's the line that comes across as he want to read. This Rosso in this case. We're going to read this style of here and not this cell and that's going to close these two transistors.  That's going to connect the zero side to the right hand bent line in the blue side to the left and Beltline the sentence of these transistors in here are quite small. They don't they can't drive a lot of this much as they can in the same thing as going to see that little change and Driver to the rails and that's why they turned bright blue and bright red. So we get both the output on the complement we could say that this the right hand side is the actual value that were storing or we could each other one doesn't make any difference and we have to put here is going on. I chose the other one and see stored on the side. And so we get the one out before you read it as RAM.  The Adventures of this super fast  because we have these transistors that can drive current on there.  And for some other reasons as well.  Are there probably the word line and then we drive a signal in through the fence and please tell us to drive one side high in one side low. This is a big transistor.  Big transistor, he's our little transistors because we want them to be as small as possible. So ask him can be a dense as possible. So this one basically just overpowers the transistors inside the S room sell it just dance so much more current on their sucks out so much more current the new transitions can handle that overwrite the values and then you turn off the deadline.  Turn off the Beltline and you get your new value and it said that's how you write around.  how to build a nest Ram  looks like this is a little bit of a tightly-packed diagram, but here is one inverter here is the other inverter and you can see that the has ass work the output.  Where's the up in here goes like this in the output of this one runs back here like this and supposed to cross coupling transistors here as well.  So this is called a 60s Ram because there are six transistors today. They actually build 70s Rams. I'm not exactly sure why I haven't looked carefully at the circuit for one, but they they stop working when I got you done.  As a result six transistors is pretty big for memory and Sebastian games are not dense, but they are really really fast. So she doesn't want to throw that trade off here is a drawing of one cell. This is in 65 nanometers. So it's .52 Square microns with turns out to be between 123 and 140 squared.  So that's pretty big. We're going to see if that is actually really big in a moment. But that's how much space it takes to go to mess around self.  So if things get worse.  Because you might want to read multiple time multiple things at the same time for me to scram and you can do that by adding multiple courts support. If I have to pour that means I can read to independent thing at the same time on the same cycle. I have three word lines.  And they're connected to three sets of deadlines.  And there is three sets of slight transistors and so I can apply these will be replicated so I can apply this is like Port one.  This one is port to and this one is Port 3 so I can read one line on Ford 103 the fires and three sets of everything else down there at the bottom three row decoders all that stuff and things are realizes that the density decreases quadratic. So when I add one poured my array both gets wider.  Boss gets wider and it gets taller, right? So if I had one extra extra times x squared term  How many ports does the MEPS Odysseus I can how many ports does the Mist register file have?  2  3  you can read and write in the same cycle so I can reach you and write once it's actually a 3-port register file if I make it to wide how many parts do I need?  Six, right we could look in and I think I in town after like 5, I need something like 15 ports or something else register file.  I think I got it when you can like multiple Reasons by from the same song, but what is me to like right off of things at once?  To initially be you wouldn't be reading or writing multiple things from the same cell so there will be another one down here and I would apply for one which is this.  If you hear I got us.  So draw a little irate of cells over here with two ports.  I thought here's three memory cells with 2.4. This is P1 P1 V1 P2 P2.  YouTube so I could read this one on P1 by lighting up this line and I can read this sell-by on P2 by writing up its P2 line.  I'm actually reading from different cells but a different places in the array.  different different ports from different lines  And then the writing works the same way.  All right, so it sounds really fast.  Turn up the hundreds of picoseconds to read a reading mess around right? So if you think about the register file in a modern processor, they say it's running at 4 gigahertz register file rights, and I don't have great numbers, but it's something on the order of price of cycle or two. So we're talking about a handful of picoseconds are a couple hundred picoseconds. So you can imagine something a hunter the gigabytes per second is pretty easy. The L1 cache were going to talk about is also a mess around and it could be easily, you know around a hundred gigabytes per second.  Search for items are not very dense, but they're super super fast.  the ram  so dear and we are going to use a different mechanism to store or a bit and we are going to snow I should tell her it's called Static before I go on to charge to the as long as you apply the voltage to the to these two inverters. It will just sit there. I won't change unless you wanted to  So dynamic random-access memory, so that's how we're going to store the value of a capacitor here connect to the ground on one side. It's going to do is Select transistor. We just connected to a bit line. Transistor is controlled by a weird line.  So we're going to do is we're going to store a voltage here on this gate of there on the thing the plates of the capacitor and then we're going to dis disconnect and open the switch. And that means of the capacitor should sit there electrically isolated in a perfect world Forever by quantum mechanics charge will eventually just sort of dissipate it will tunnel off electrons will tunnel off the plate of my of my capacitor. They're also usually that the charge will go away and I will lose my value. That's why it's called dynamic because over time that I use changes.  So I let cake sit on the order of microseconds tens of microseconds. So it's about 20 times better than S ramsell. So we're going to give up going to gain a whole bunch of density and we're going to take on this problem that we have this 2K thing we have to deal with at the dealer.  so if we want to read  so here is our front of typical right here. So the first thing we're going to do it's very good lines that are next to each other. That's the safespace only one bit line per column. So I'm going to a pre-charged my bet lines.  Then I will open my world liner set my world line High I will close this transistor and if you noticed very carefully the color of these two lines shifted just a little bit it became a little bit more red and it wasn't going to happen is it my bit was destroyed. So this used to be bright red, and now it's pink because I dumped all the charger I had on the Beltline the bit line as much higher capacitance then my capacitor. So the average is quite low.  Now the sun Sam comes along.  And it drives those two lines to their to their correct values. So it's going all the way there. So Dover completed the transition that restores the bid on my capacitor because it's going to drive the charge on there as well. And then I open the transistor and my value is stored again on my capacitor.  All right, so that's great. Now if I wanted to ride I just closed the capacitor. I drive a value on there and I just over I would turn the capacitor. It's pretty easy. And then the final thing I do is I need to refresh very few milliseconds. So sexually I didn't seem right. This is like milliseconds.  Every few milliseconds have to go in and rewrite every bit in your dear am so is your computer's are sitting here right now. They all have deer and Main memory. Your computer is sitting and are busily going through periodically reading each line and d'ram every like 15 seconds or so to maintain all the values that are to keep all those guys from the King away narcos on Riverside means that the Consumers power and also takes time because if I need to do something else on my dear, I'm busy busy doing this.  There's some interesting security implications there ahead of cold boot Call of Duty tax. So if I were to ask you to leave the room.  I could take one of your laptop's I could open it up. I could take some canned are you know like the canned air that you used to like clean stuff? So inside there if I turned it over and squirt I'll be really really cold. I can take that music to squirt onto your dims inside your a laptop. I can pull the dim out stick it into my laptop or into maybe a little test rate that I had turned it back on and I can read the values that were left over in your dear am so I could extract your encryption keys or your passwords or your text messages or whatever from your do you have?  Can I call the quantum mechanical effect? And so if I make it cold colder, it happens less quickly and I'll actually hang around for a long time. It's also has a wide distribution of how quickly the cells Decay so some of them will be good for minutes. But some of them will Decay pretty quickly and are some cool animations. You can look at a store like a picture of the sun. You can watch as how the bits Decay over time if you stop refreshing sticks around for a while and so there's even work on trying to extract data from people's laptops have been off for a long time and so forth. All right.  So this is a slice through a ID Ram chip.  So the key here is the way that you make a deer and a good deer am is you make the capacitor as large as possible capacitance to be large so that it can drive the bit line pretty hard and also seem to have to refresh it is often to the to the area of the plates write the two parallel plates in the capacitor. So if I want to build a big capacitor  The only the only choice I have is to make it. All right, if I make it big like in the plane and I'll beat you won't be Dance Center. Also they do very tall. So this down here. This is the boundary the boundary the boundary is down here. This is the surface of the Silicon. These are some wires and up here are these giant capacitors that they build these are really really tall?  Turn the truth around here. They're very very tiny. This is big towers of material appear in there should have laid out like this. So this is a silicon substrate. This is basically a conductor that runs up here shooting thing where you have these two big spiders that go up. So this is one plate of the capacitor. This is an insulator this black thing and then I hear we have another II play the capacity to be grounded. And so this makes the  This makes the capacitance really.  Hi.  Even cooler. I think this is how they do it. Now. These are built up out of a silicone be used to go to this or these are called trench capacitors and they would dig this hole in the Silicon substrate.  Ready for this thing. Like if you look at the aspect ratio of this whole it's like what 20 times deeper than it is wide and it is this scale bar is 2 microns to dig a little tiny hole. It has to be very deep. And if you look at it, the walls are very straight.  So the way they do this is insane. So what you do is you have the surface of the Silicon you put down a mask.  Write down. This is where I'm going to take my whole thing that goes on in photolithography is done with like bats of caustic chemicals. He like dip it in and rode away stuff. So if I did this and I just dumped some like hydrofluoric acid on here something you would eat this away, but it would sort of it would undercut right?  And you would end up with like this big bulbous whole that's not what you want.  So what you do instead?  did you use a gas phase actions and you make it really hot there flying around and they're flying around randomly up here and the only ones and you make this layer of  I've resent stop here this mask pretty thick. So the only the only molecules that actually make it down here or probably more or less perpendicular to the surface of the of the silicone and the deeper get the more selective it is so this will just dig a hole.  All the way down and then you played the inside actually don't know if you played the inside with metal.  Play silicon goes in here. That's a metal or a conductor. At least then you played the the you put in the conductor as a dielectric and then you fill the hole with more Paula silicon CertiFit Office Depot. And then you get this big deep capacitor is like  You know, it's insane. It's amazing. All right.  Amazing what money can do right this is because d'ram is like I'm used to be the hottest test about your newest best process technology. So people would make people still do make billions and billions of dollars selling deer and sleigh we can spend a lot of time making this work so fast, there's a bunch of optimization that they put in 2D Rams to make them kind of cover up the fact that they're not very fast. So there's a couple of stages you go through when you open a deer and the first is called opening a page. So this is a page across the deer MRA address you send the address to your dear and Chip and it says I want to read this row.  That will get all of the capacitor the 8,000 bit. So he killed its wide. So whatever I do a reading from a deer on every date kilobits and then I can apply multiple column addresses one after another Sia playlist blue call him a dress that goes into the column Dakota and if I apply in our green column address than the than the Green Day Will Come Out And so I can take different slices of the of the row buffer and I can leave the door open for a long time. So I work for a company that built the officer that did HD HD HD video decoding and so that when you were reading a frame of video  You would read the entire contents of a row buffer. So I just have to do the open page part, which is pretty slow like 30 nanoseconds are so and then I would get the maximum benefit out of opening that page cuz I would read out all of that data sequentially on so this would be much faster. I'll see you a lot more bandwidth out of this thing called Burst Mode access, which is where you suck out stuff through the column decoder.  I'm afraid I have another all right. So this is what I die looks like old now, but they look basically the same you a bunch of a raise. This is one array.  These are each copies of what I showed you on the previous slide. They're called banks in each. One of these Banks is more less than independent memory and I can open separate pages in each of these bank. So in this case, I know I can have like 16 Pages open at one time and I can also you know, it takes as I said, it takes like thirty nanoseconds to open a page in One bank, but I could open up a page in bank one and Bank two and then makes three so I can overlap those the process of opening those pages so I can save a lot of those a lot of that delay and then I'm clever I can schedule things. So I'll open a bunch of bank then go back and read from the first one I opened and so forth and modern memory controller is on your processors do that kind of thing as drawing from memory. Not really not at all this just to give you an idea of how complicated this is. This is a block diagram of a modern Z Ram chip does a bunch of banks.  And this is sort of the core of what we've talked about so far is a bunch of porifera logic around there for doing controlling power and doing automatic refresh and some other stuff. This is a state machine for deer and chip is a whole bunch of state so you can go through and you know is you total the pins on a dear and cheerful transition between these and these are different a different Power properties. Some of them are reading and writing or free charging bunch of different things that you can do or almost out of time.  Oh, man. All right. I guess I'll pick up here. I have more time that I can pack into last minute.  Yes.  Yes. "
