It's more than I can process while standing in front of a group of 40 or 50 or how many people you are.  Hello.  Sure. Why not? What could go wrong?  To hear all the Google employees are walking out on Google today because they are.  are not dealing with  what?  I don't know what I'm doing. Where am I going?  I got like five of these open.  All right. All right.  You know what? I'm going to use chalk.  All right, so I have bananas first. You can't see the other cuz I close it wonderful.  All right.  Now I know how to take a screen capture screenshot or whatever it is, but I can actually run the screen. All right.  five instructions  And so the question is how many cycles are going to take we have I was going to ask you for a long long time. So if I could lie forever the branch of the result in deecos, that means there's one load 161 cycle to resolve the branches branches are predicted not taken and the processor has one load to lace lot. So  Let's go throwing just count how many instructions each of the how many cycles each of these instructions is going to take in the best-case. So how many cycles will the load take?  1 cycle and is there a data dependence between the load Word in the following ad?  No sew does hello delay slot come into effect.  No, so that means that is fine. So how many how many instructions will the ad take?  one how about the store and they had  And the branch will take at least one cycle. The branches are going to be predicted not taken. So we're going to say we're going to walk off the end of the loop. So we're going to ask you the branch after the drop two. One, two, three, four, five Cycles to execute that Loop. The branch is going to predict not taken. So we're going to fall out of the loop, which is incorrect, right? Because we're going to go back to the top of the loop because we're executing a 10,000 times. So we are going to fetch one instruction past the end of the loop how many instructions will that thing to take to execute?  What are so it's going to add? It's it's one wasted fetch lot. Right? So you're right. Whoever said it'll take several instructions to several Cycles. Execute is right, but it's going to be going to fetch one instruction that we don't need to execute and then we're going to flush squash out of the structure and jump back to the top. So there's five instructions here. So it's five Cycles Plus one extra instruction that we're going to fetch that we don't need slats 6 cycles per iteration.  Say it again.  So the extra cycle that we spent a flush.  so remember in our  so there's just one. There's just one fix once I thought I was off the branches. So the next cycle after the branch, we're going to fetch an incorrect instruction. And then as soon as the branch was all you're going to will squash that instruction at the same time will start fetching the correct instruction.  It'll be 6. Yeah.  the branch of the branches resolved in decode  the artist  this is what about execute?  Instruction to Northwest resolving execute it which means because the branches have to wait for our two.  That is a good point. All right.  Come on.  some sort of  so I think that  How does a good point all right?  so if we have  1 2 3 4 5 pipeline stages when we get to the branch the branch.  We'll need to when the branch that will resolve the problem.  Add call the speaker ad.  It's goes fetch decode execute memory right back. And then here's the branch.  Rights of this Branch gets bashed here. It gets decoded hear the branches are supposed to resolve and they would like to resolve in decode but we don't have the value here because the value for R1 or R2.  R2 is getting crowded right here. So this is a backward arrow in time which we can't do. So that means that the branch needs to delay for one cycle and then we can forward the value to decode a message will go decode execute and so forth but the branch resolves here. So that means that we are stalled the front of the pipeline is stalled and we  FATZ the next instruction here  I actually sent true we predicted so we fetched instruction here, right? This is the  Nest protect  Construction. So in this resolve, this will get squashed and on the next cycle. We will fetch the next instruction.  And that means that there is that right?  Yeah, this will be the load Word.  I am so this is one two three.  Slots for the branch of the for the out of the branch and then plus three for the stuff for so we still get sick.  How do I manage that?  HD Kodi code  I'd say there's a stall the front end stalls.  Best biscuits squash I fed chair and that gets us to 7.  Justin is frictional get fast, but then we go after that. There's a gap right here where we're stalled in the front end.  Yes, I shouldn't touch that and then it stalls here, right? That's the store. That's right.  Yes.  What If We Had a Brain still a slide and then we in this case since branches resolving decode we wouldn't have them if prediction  Sophie Hannah Branch delay slot we would have to do is  we have to put something after the branch.  I am and  what's we can't bring the ad down because the branch is dependent on the ad and we can't bring the  Store word down why can't we move the store word into the branch till I slide.  What is that called?  What kind of dependence?  Driving after your radio. So it's a yes without a false dependents or a true dependents false dependents are two.  They renamed I'll actually it's it's actually harder than that. It's Loop Cary they call it because our two gets produced here and gets used up there in the load. So we have to add another copy to duplicate the value of R2 somewhere play slot. That might do it. Also, so grab something from the following adoration. I don't know I wouldn't quite be safe. Yes.  If there is no forwarding no because there is no data dependence between the odd one in the store word. No true dependents.  Oh wait. Sorry. You're right. But send text restore word always messes me up cuz it's backwards, right?  Sorry, say that again.  Oh.  If we said that there was no for if there was no forwarding there would be a hazard.  That is correct.  I got a question like that in the midterm. Please ask we will try to specify stuff completely. But sometimes it messed up good.  cycle class number four  Donna Christian stuff  sure, I think yes. I mean we should get the same answer either way.  So, you know if you get the right answer and you may be right down how you calculate it. They will probably be full of credit.  Yes.  If there was an independent there what would happen to the execution time?  instructions  So in this particular case, we have a we have a load delay slot. So there is nothing to show you really write. So if I had an infant that was are not there would be a day to defend their way to this is all the tricky you might think that there is a day to dependents, but because there is no dependents.  Send it. Is what it means when I write that down if I have a slide in my right down our 9 right here.  It is not an it is not a day to dependents because I know that I'm the spot right after the load that the the output of the load is not available.  Yeah, I get the old value of the of R9.  Yes.  Honest say homework.  the venerable pipeline diagram  Alright, the figure below shows the pipeline datapath with a control registers connected blah blah blah forwarding is available wherever needed and use a forwarding value. Even though the 40 Legends by the figure also assume there is no load delay.  Consider the following set of instructions for assuming that the inspection stage of the first for the of the first instruction execution cycle 1, what are the values of the following control signals on cycle 5 you must stayed if a single a090 or don't care. All right. So the way that you do this  I really wish I could write on my screen. So the way you do this start with one of the one.  Probably so that the load Word fetch on start on cycle one.  So that means that  Incycle five  That's going to be in right back. And this isn't right back in. This is in memory in this is an excuse. This isn't deaconesses in touch. So the ad  The actors going to be in effect this add up here is going to be in Fetch. So what we're going to do and are there any control lines that we need to set in French?  There is this one PC source.  And what do we know about the source added to the source for the PC for?  The add instruction. So where is the address for the Adam session was going to come from? Is it going to come from this thing the incrementar or is it going to come from the branch Branch Target calculation?  I am so we're going to do the instruction. That means we're going to take the instruction word. We're going to send it up to control control is going to do all the logic about what the hell you was going to do for this instruction and how the different boxes are going to be set. So the only control I know you just said here.  Is what does that even say? Okay. So I load Word. This is going to be the subtract. So this value comes back the right back pain comes back from the from the subtract. Is this going to be a 1 or a 0?  Does the Samsung tractors down here in right back? Do you subtract instructions right to the register file?  Yes, they have a destination register. So what this going to be?  One. Alright next cycle that I will go here. And now we have we have to configure it's going to execute to have to configure the ale you so that they can figure out what's going to come into the ALU. So what is the value of the ALU Source mucks going to be for this?  add  does it come from the immediate or does it come from the register file?  We're doing this ad right here.  Santa comes from the register file, which is this line here. So this control line should be a zero.  We need to there should be a nail you off.  Types of this is how you control this is going to be whatever the right code is for add, right? They'll you can do lots of stuff. Yes.  Start a streak you can think of the subtract is here the first load where does here I need to go through this process for each of them easier for me to keep track. So he said this where it is the  Register their stuff. What's the setting for the register destination box?  I think it's zero. That's a good question.  I bet it's going to come we want the register destination to come from the  The output of memory right here, right? I don't want to be coming to the destination of the stores. Are we going to write to memory?  Now we're going to read for memory know this is a don't care on actually feeds back. Anyway, I don't care but if he's back into the earlier, there's no read and then when the final inspection gets to the right backstage and it will select the output of the ale you which will be zero.  Yes.  Remember I should be there. Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I recommend coming to class listening carefully doing the readings.  I should have a better answer this. My mom is actually reading and study skills teacher. So of course, I know nothing about reading and study skills.  I mean those problems in the back of the chapters in the book.  I mean, I think  So if I were going to study for this, what I would do is I would probably get together with some of my classmates and go over problems. And the reason I say that is because there's a lot of plans that shows at the way. I really good way for it to learn is to explain stuff. And so teaching is a good way of learning and your peers in the class or actually a little better than that better for that than the Tudors or me. And the reason for that is that I've been doing this for a long time. So the way that I think about computer architecture is difference. You guys are also struggling with the same problems and have the same kind of troubles in her thinking of things and kind of the same way. And so you're really good at teaching each other. That's the basis of the underlying science for like the clicker questions that we doing stuff worth more of that.  That is my advice. Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  What are we glazed over?  glazed over  You know, the level of detail that we're going to expect on the midterm is commensurate with the amount of time. We spend talking about it in class roughly speaking. So animals law, I would be prepared for Randall's performance equation prepared for the performance equation. This problem is one that a lot of people this is all that more of a conceptual problem. So the key thing to understand here is the question about whether Branch Petition is important for a particular processor has to do with how many instructions you fetch for a thread.  Before the branch resolves, right? And so for MEPS, it's like one. So Branch mission is not very important for doodle issue. It's like to write so it's more important cuz I'm fetching farther out of order processor. It's a lot right? Because even even if it's a process or even if a to White out of order, there's two members to new pipeline stages that we had it right? We had to register a name and re-edit schedule. Right? So just takes longer to resolve the ranches smt. We're going to feel normal out of order processor. We fetch a bunch of instructions all in the same thread. I'm so every cycle or making a lot of a lot more guesses about what that's right is doing for spreading out across multiple threads. So we're going to make less progress along each of those individual threads. So that means that it should be less important thing out of order.  Right because of this guy is inspecting for instructions all in one thread. And this one is fetching one instruction from each of four threads. Each of those threads has to speculate less instructions before the branches going to resolve.  But it's going to be more important for the sn2 in the delicious frosting because the smt processor still has the rename and schedule stages. So it will get this one will get farther and have to speculate more but less than that.  Yes.  I was under the impression. You just said smt processor.  I'm at the Crossroad of what of threads.  That's actually that's that's that's clearly on Imperial. Just to be clear.  No matter what.  Like we didn't talk about like a SMG scheduling like I wasn't whatsoever. So you can always make sure that your  grab another way  And you would not in use.  So you just invented something called Hardware multi-threading is the technical term for that thousand threads per core.  so dispatch from a different thread each cycle actually, so  I think this problem would be clear. If I said it was a four-way SMG that stretched from 4th resy cycle if the SMC were very very wide and lots of very very large number of threads. Then this question would be not as clear-cut.  But are you can't emulate that lie, it's actually less sensitive than even the single issue the question.  Well, nothing. I mean this we can get by with no Branch furniture at all. So we can't be less sensitive than that. You could build an SMC process server. The branch structure is not very important people do.  so  you're right conceptually, but not practically a common problem and I can be me. Yes.  Well, you do have other you have other choices, so that's why you don't speculate as far as you would with an out of order processor. But if you're imagine you're catching like to instructions for threatened smt you will speculate more than you would have to do is your processor because the pipeline is deeper.  You can always fetch him a different thread, but that's red might also be speculating.  So you can always like smoothly executing the next instructions not like you need to squash something.  So you you still there still no guarantee that the that you will know there's no guarantee that on a particular cycle. You will have at least one thread where the PC is known for sure. That's not a guarantee that you can make.  now  next question or more innocenti  registering a meeting sample  Sure.  Alright, so here is a registered name. Exactly didn't class. What is there a particular part of it? That is?  confusing or confounding  concussion. When should you do the new physical register you always using your physical register?  When should you recycle them? Okay, that's a good question to so I go through this example here so that everything has been renamed sorry on every instruction in a list of the renamed registers. We use the new one and every cycle. So we just reuse them forever. Now the question is when you recycle them, right? So when can I reuse P4 and it's a little tricky. So originally I said that pee for correspond architecture register are three examples of fonts architecture register are too when I overwrite the value of our to hear that means  As soon as this instruction has completed.  Are actually the previous instruction we can do this instruction to as soon as this construction. I'll be called commit but basically gets to the right backstage has committed that means that everything prior to it is also committed because things complete in order and if that point since this one we used our to I know that I can recycle the old physical register that represented are too I can put it back in the free list. Yes.  all your available Navy Christiansburg Windows 9  Well one of those things as early as possible cuz I kind of question. Yeah, the reason you want to do that. It doesn't make any difference really like as far as the renaming of get rid of all the dependency just the same the reason you want to recycle this is because you have a processor is doing this all very quickly and it wants to remember a few things as possible. So this is the moment when we know that are two or that the thing that represented our two can be reused if we wanted to like wait to reclaim it. We would have to remember that somehow. So this is what we know it's so in this gets to the right backstage that is when we should release it.  Yeah, it just you know, we're here we know it. Let's do it. I don't know. I mean the implementation details are probably quite complicated about how to implement the free list you can think of this as just as rap5 being dropped into a  fight over something to get reused at some point later.  So I mean who knows this is like a the question here like three of the controlling question about what how you implement that has to do with like how you're going to make the rename stage be as efficient as possible with the lowest cycle time. And so I mean circuit tricks. I mean, who knows what they do? It could be lots of different things depending on  You know the details very deep details of the design. Yes.  Every register is written.  So if you're only like three games in the  so what happens is I try allocate a new register on every instruction for the destination. I guess if you can start if the inspection doesn't have a destination and every time I write to register and then I use this mapping, which I've updated down here to rename that the source.  Thesaurus registers when I get down here, I rename are too and I make it PA and I choose that arbitrarily I can use any physical register any free fidget physical MP4 because I can look back and see that R1 and R3.  R1 and R3 map to P6 and T4  department stores Thursday  78th and so they were never  Are there never written to in the in the in the example in the problem? Is that you mean?  Well, the thing is because we don't have the entire history of the program in the homework. So those instructions were those registers were written at some point in the past and they were Reen and that they were renamed at that time. And so there's an entry in the table and they would be renamed. Yes.  Yes.  No.  Yeah, you're you and dependents would be broken.  Yes.  Sorry.  Let's see here.  All right homework for question 3 which part?  But also what's your question?  I just kind of confused about how he was resolved for the day.  Gotham  You got like gigawatt-hours out of it instead of speed up. So what is the question here applique? Let's go back and look at the  How do I can I just have one?  Single patch. Thank you.  Alright, so a problem 1 we have this code.  Draw some arrows. So this part makes sense sense.  All right down the pipe line diagram draw the arrow starting date of forwarding that's good.  All right, if I application spends 80% of his time in this code how much speed up in the data forwarding bring this application soon date of flooring is going to pick another part of the application. You may need results from the previous Parts. You can receive full credit for it. If your work shows what numbers you use and how to drive to speed up. All right, so  we have this version of the code, which takes  I'll see you then. LOL. You said it went weird i o let's go through and doing the performance equation first then will we can  see what happened, so  So the basic has one that make sense of that new cells using stalls in Part B. We get a CPI of a little bit more and so we get 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1  1 + 3  so the CPI for this instruction is one because there's no stalls for here. It is recounted is 3 because there are two stalls right here. There are 1 + 3 + 2 there's one still here. So that's the two and this one has no stalls so we can add that up and we get the how to 658 / 5 is 1.6.  All right, and then we can do the performance equation.  So the speed up for the version without forwarding of the CPI without 14 is 1.6.  Oh and your samples on so then?  All right, so you got something other than 1.43.  Yeah, cuz I think the problem that I had was at RCI end up with tentacles rather than okay.  Brain Part B, I guess.  Okay.  Yep, right there.  next question  shot clock is ticking. All right. Yes.  Yes.  And what is the question?  Okay, so it has them branches considered our usual. I find processor has all possible for running pass and ID.  As we've talked about the example code looks like this cuz I had it which we haven't covered.  Dunt Dunt Dunt assuming there's no to provide the logic and ID to detect a stall in this type of Hazard occurs, the logic should be some of that given in page 334 of a textbook  All right. So does anyone know where the hazard is that? We haven't done this before. Yes.  That is right. So this is why we ran into this earlier and that's really our problem where there is a the branch the input to the branch might be available in the ale you are in the execute stage, but it might be needed back here to do the comparison. So this is the branch resolved comparator and it's possible that the one of the inputs for that comparator is being computed over here in the NBL you so that is the that's the stall or the potential hazard.  Give the logic and I needed a text to stall in this type of Hazard occurs on the logic to be silly. What's on page 334 in the textbook. I have course have memorized every page of our textbook so I know exactly what that looks like.  Give me just a second. We can look at page 344.  Really? Thought I said 344.  10 + 34, okay.  311  I like that. All right, so we can write down. This is like, you know, they're like pseudocode or something so we can write down logic is instead of going to that and also because I can't write on my screen own ice.  That's super.  Okay. Alright. So let's think about how we will detect this. How would it take this Hazard? So we're here in decode. And so the question is whether or not we want to know whether or not the destination register here. Where is that where we get the destination register for the for the instruction that's currently in where do we get the destination register for the instruction and sitting in this pipeline register and so I can get it right here. So this is like the destination. Destination and we want to know if that is equal to either one of the destination registers that are here.  they just check whether you know, if  this isn't it in the kind of Sudafed that they give you.  you know if  Something like this. So if the thing between ID  between so here's i d e x so f i d e x  If i v e x register, I think it's is a d or T. I cannot remember the destination register is equal to the destiny thesaurus register for the First Source registered for what's in i f i d come on.  Thank you.  All right, if those two are equal or the destination destination register for idx matches the other stars register for my f i d then there will be a hazard. Does that make sense?  kind of  Yes.  Yes, all possible forwarding pads.  Because this is not a possible forwarding path seem to get from here back to hear I drew it up over here. Right? So this is the same situation the execute stage just hear it needs to provide added value to the decode stage because that's where branches resolved and so is pointing backwards so you can't possibly forward because the data just the value just doesn't exist yet for all your important as the value exists, but it's just not in the right place so we can have some wires to get it to where it needs to go.  Yes.  architecture  You might want to know why they exist.  how to craft a good start why they exist how they work in the ISA what they're good for  I think so. Yeah.  The assembly programming problems on the midterm will be simple and you will have access to a reference that tells you about all the instructions you might need.  You don't need to go memorize that stuff.  adjust  Last lecture this lecture to I guess.  extra credit  Do you think we're together is cool. Do you think the lead designer wave School It's Kayla was really cool.  Yes, or no a very cool be slightly Cool C. Pretty cool D extra super cool or D. Just cool. Those are your choices.  Click all that apply.  I don't know if there is vitiligo. I don't know I have  Probably not and if there is something to look over though, I didn't post the slide. So no no weights. Good questions.  Now, go ahead.  Yes, so I homework 6 is coming out tonight homework 6 the goal is there's actually not a lot of extra material since homework 5.  Sensors not really material today. We just talked about some kind of clean up stuff on Tuesday. So the goal of homework 6 we prepared as kind of a practice study guide something for the midterm.  So I will be graded as well, but I would recommend that you pay attention to it. In fact, most of it is problems that we made for the midterm and then we didn't include so we put them to the homework instead.  Yes.  Yeah, the Peugeot me a sign is running some technical problems. I'm not optimistic about the programming assignments happening this quarter.  I got a sad about that who's sad about the lack of a programming assignment?  That's cool. I'll be sad about it, too.  It was going to be really cool to I will see what I thought. The problem is that I was going to be I was going to give you some Sims like this simple machine learning code and asked you to optimize it with vectors. But in order to do that, we needed access to a machine and then take some measurements on it. The problem is we don't have access to the right kind of machines because I need to be in the cloud Lane to be bare metal and that is turned out to be more complicated than we had hoped. So if we can make it work, then we will we will do it. Otherwise, it probably won't happen. Yes.  You can already drop one homework.  drop the beat Rathalos homework anyway  No, no practice midterms.  I'm giving you the key. I've always feel like seriously the same people that built the homework's and the reading quiz questions are exactly the same people building the midterms not so creative that we have like a completely different mode of thinking that we use for the midterms. Yes.  I'm going to post a key for those.  There's a question of here somewhere. Yes.  Yes.  It's for studying for the mid-term.  It's like a twofer you get to study and get credit for it.  Is it why?  Credit no credit. No.  You're going to go straight on the one hand people want to practice midterm really had I gave you a practice midterm described as homework 6 and you like I don't want to do it. So like I don't know what to do about that.  That's a good question.  No, I can have it do on Monday night. Would that be better though that doesn't help to I could have been due on Sunday night. I can give you the key on Monday.  I don't think that's a good idea. Yeah. Alright, I'll see if we can make that happen. So I made it home record video on Sunday night and I'll give you the key on Monday morning.  Yes.  Oh.  Should I plug in the hair? We can do a clicker quiz?  Yeah.  August 2nd  Alright everyone get out of your Clickers.  Oh, actually I got to fire up the the tool here.  I was hoping at the base station. We just let me click but I guess it's going to take a minute. So you had a quite what was your question?  Creativity I like this.  Are all the questions be completing this?  1/3 way, I'll pass out of our divisive politics.  Alright, well, I'm firing up. The Clicker app doesn't have any other questions.  Or what is the next question?  You guys all registered to vote?  No, yes votes. It's fun to get a sticker.  you have the right to complain for the next two years and complain anyway, but  know that questions  everyone's too worried about this this issue of the  of the homework  Alright, so here are the options.  I was just thinking okay. I was just thinking earlier. I was like putting on my personal laptop on the screen is so harrowing but worrisome on their due.  Sunday night  bedo  am I podcasting?  Oh, no.  So this is this is very this is just a cow. That's okay. This is this is what I put on to my I have a 2 year old daughter and she wanted a cow on her Jack O'Lantern. So I got a template of a cow, cuz I'm not that artistic. She was very excited. It's really hard to find a simple. She had to get the better. She was going to start screaming so we had to go to simple cow. All right, I do.  All right. So those are the two out. Those are the first two options.  Are you can't see?  All right option A is do Sunday night's option b is due Wednesday night vote now or forever hold your peace.  All right. So 5 4 3 2 1 not very good attendance at our review session.  All right, so they they ye the cell that that's 47 and favors or the sounds. This is a 47 vs 17.  inow  All right. Hope so now I just dropped a laptop.  I do Wednesday.  all  correctness or completeness  vote again  Yes.  What's a quark? Is there some confusion?  Oh Sunday and completeness.  Lo and behold everyone like that answer?  Oh, I see so dude, Sunday. Do you want Sunday all completing this and then I give you the key.  Why why is the weight wires?  Aside from the fact that it's all completeness.  Why is that better than just having it all due on Sunday?  Well, that's just like a Buenas card. Okay?  Yeah.  Okay, we're going to call this.  completeness plus plus  Oh, yes. I know now.  So what this means is that we are actually going like we are going to hold you to a slightly harder bar on completeness than we usually do.  So it actually like I don't know you can just like Scribble in some garbage in like hell that is complete ass like you need to show that you like such a serious stab of the problem. Yes.  The gentleman here in the gray cast has just made everything in the future completeness plus plus.  No, you should not just scribble in garbage. But okay, so no.  All right, so we will have it do on Sunday all completeness and we will post the key right after it might be do a little bit earlier on Sunday Smith can post it that night rather have to stay up until midnight.  Alright, are we out of time?  The shot clock is running.  All right, I will start shutting everything down if you have someone else for something, and ask them at all around. "
