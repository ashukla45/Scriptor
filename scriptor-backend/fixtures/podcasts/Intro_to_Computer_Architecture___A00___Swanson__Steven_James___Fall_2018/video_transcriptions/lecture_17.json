So today we are going to talk about Thursday run if I guess speaker other Professor from the Department. This is really loud today. Is that  Is it just me? I can't how do I do that?  I don't think there is.  Maybe  all right. I'll wait here.  Oh well. Oh God worked in that now you can hear me at all.  Hello. All right. So I think they're going to the guest lecture. So how do you smile today is another professor in the department? He does he builds processor is specifically for machine learning. So he's going to talk about how you can do that will be responsible for the content of a stock at least that a high-level so you should make sure to come I will ask him to podcast it, but I'm not sure if he knows how to podcast so our mileage may vary.

Next Tuesday about security issues in architecture try to explain to you how Spectre and meltdown worked with your two big security problems it until it had to deal with over the last year and then if there's time left and there might well be then we will start the final review and then next Thursday. They will be more final review was just like the earlier final review store come with questions and I'll answer them until you stop asking him.  Many questions about that. Yes.

This is more or less like what we did with the midterm. So homework 9 will probably be a little bit longer than usual, but it'll all be for completeness. So I would recommend doing that to help you study.  Any questions about that?  So what are they saying is that so the final will be on Friday. We are going to Great it on Friday night because we know how to party and then you're the regrades if you have regrade requests are going to be due.  Sunday  at noon  So you're going to have like a day if you want to regret any of the problems on the midterm or the final my grades are due on Monday until he's just very little time to resolve any problems. I will also released a version of the grade. She that is totally up to date until the final and maybe a little missing homework 9, I guess I'll see you in the battle be up so you can check and make sure everything looks okay, as far as that goes then we'll just drop the final grades in and it will compute your grades and then I'll upload them to the university.  Any questions about that?  All right.  Venue special arrangements for the final you should know who you are already. I've talked to several of you. The time is coming to nail down those Logistics or come down and talk to me after the class today and we will figure that out.  All right.  You know just to go questions.  Comments or concerns. All right, so they were going to talk about  Set alarm so far. We've been talking about it talk about the CPU and then we talked about the memory system memory fast by building an array of Cash's how we deal with main memory and we talked last time about the timer for about 30 lbs and cmp's a little bit about a multi-core until programming but that is just part of the computer system has the colonel around which everything else that orbits but there's a bunch of other stuff. That's kind of stuck on your computer. And that's all those are all called IO devices. So we're going to talk about the basic structure of the other computers cut for time.  And soon as I go about with the basics of Iowa, and then we're going to spend some time talking about discs, which is where we store all of our data why they're slow and then we'll talk about flash drives and how they work because they're also have a lot in common with some of the other architectural stuff that we've talked about because they're based on a memory rather than a spinning piece of rust.  So I got a nice is there lots of kind of devices devices as a few on here, right? There's a monitor. There's a mouse with a keyboard. There's a hard drive. This is the this is the Large Hadron Collider right here in generate State about 700 megabytes a second when it's running.  There are hard drives that can do about a 5:50 to 120. Megabytes per second are pretty slow. I should have an SSD on here early ssds can do it about 2 gigabytes of second. I hit a self-driving car self-driving cars generate David about 1 terabyte per day. I'll let you know when I guess plug them into your computer cuz you need a really long cable. Actually, you know self-driving car is really a big fast computer system attached to a whole bunch of IO devices, right all the cameras and sensors and everything that needs to sense the world around it. All. Your monitor is also an IO device like does 60 hertz of the stuff 30 inch display is about a gigabyte a second.  Pencil is lots of data flowing all around your computer system in a lot of it's going very fast.  So what are some characteristics that you would like to have in a computer system as far as hooking things to it?  What do you want?  Yes.  Graphics card, so that is a will call that high-speed.  accelerators  what else?  Your liver have any frustrations about trying to hook things up to your computer's.  Now the hands come up. All right. Yes.  Universal  Like for instance the universal serial.  bus  what else?  How Universal is the universal serial bus especially USB C?  I have like six dongles in my bag.  What else? Yes.  minimal  Drivers, yeah, we like stuff. We're going to call this plug-in play right? You just plug it in and it just works so used to be there when you got a graphics card because we didn't have graphics cards instead. You would buy like a sound card, right? Cuz you want your computer to play sound and you would drive to a parking lot in the middle of Puyallup Washington to meet a guy in a car that would sell you cuz you was on eBay except there was no immediate back then so is Craigslist and he was going to sell you a sound card wrapped in aluminum foil.  This is a story. I just definitely didn't happen to me and you take it home and then you would have to like move these jumpers around on the card to like configure it so that your computer can find it. I don't know you feel like a Saturday afternoon doing this because you definitely know how to party and at the time of the end you could play like a bad sound through your phone to your computer, but now you just buy a new graphics card to download some drivers remove the drivers are already there ready to go and then kind of configures itself any other desirable characteristics  Do you want to try Rio to be slow?  High-throughput, I'll just call that fast.  Try that again fast.  There's a few things you want to have a longer that's their stuff. We would like to be able to hook up keyboards mice displays Network Cartoon Network digital camera scanners scientific equipment. Will I get to be plugging play the fewer wires the battery like it to be Wireless right? Like Bluetooth is pretty cool works. Most of the time no drivers just works. It should be fast low latency high bandwidth low power should be cheap. It's really easy develop hardware and software for on there should be good development tools. We need to have good. I also makes it easy to build the particular Computing system that we would like. So this is all based on a pretty narrow interface on the processor. So the processor knows how to do basically two things that have to do with il the first thing he does is something called programmed. I don't know what this means is that the io devices basically everything all the I all the io devices that are attached to your computer. They communicate with the processor.  By mapping these things called control registers into the address pay into the kernel address space. So we've talked about  so here's a physical address space for a processor in a bunch of it is d'ram.  And that's what I actually did it goes but over here, there's little slices of it and one of these will be USB and one of these will be your GPU your graphics card. And one of these will be your you know, you're sad a controller which is how you hook up your your hard drive. And these are magical the store actually gets it goes to the memory hierarchy just like normal and eventually instead of going to dear Amy gets tense of send over the system bus. I think I'll pcie then we'll talk about it and it gets sent to the car in the car does like hey someone just rode for to this address and then the the the hardware knows how to interpret that shift from USB 3 to USB 2 or something like that and something big and complicated like a g fuel have thousands of these control registers used to control basically everything off.  About the interaction between the CPU the direct view in the hardware is that there's a big cashing hierarchy in between the processor and these magical addresses and some of these addresses have properties. Like if you issue a store to them, they might actually do something or if you should read it and they might actually do something. So if you issue a read to a USB device, it might actually go and read some data or it might trigger, you know, an LED on your dog or something to flash.  So is Logan stores actually have a fax means that if they get stopped by the cashing hierarchy of the things won't work. So there are ways to turn off caching over parts of your address space. So the access is all old go always go all the way down to the memory hierarchy and never gets held up anywhere.  First works for small acts of Citizen works for kind of setting things up.  But if you want to move lots of day to use something called direct memory access and this allows is it allows your GPU to reach over into your d'ram and copy data to and from its the weight of this artwork is that if I want to move some data say to my GPU to load of texture or something use some of these people are request to send a message to the GPS says Hey, I want you to read this slice of d'ram over in his house. This has the picture that I want to use and the Jeep you will then initiated the Ameriquest will go and pull that they are crossed. And so this is how we move lots of David. So most of the day to actually moves by but it's all kind of coordinate it with this program died out. It's a pretty clever unreasonably elegant system in any case is definitely the system that we have in our sort of stuck with it because of all this way over many decades.  The next piece of something called interrupts.  Is basically like a hardware device raising his hand and saying hey processor. I need you to do something for me. And so what will happen is this the processor is running along the front of your program and something happens like a dma one of these big transfers from one device to another finishes. And so the GPS a hay processor. I'm done doing that transfer you ask me for and then the process will need to deal with it or a packet might arrive over the network. So tell the see if you had a package arrived you needed you need to deal with it or maybe the processor set a timer. So inside your computer is a little piece of Hardware that the timer until you know, give me an interruption 4 days or two hours are 20 milliseconds or whatever I want.  So the basic way that interrupts work, is it the CPU is running along all of a sudden the center of Cups and comes in and it basically acts like a branch.  And all of a sudden control transfers to something called the interrupt Vector are true north Handler and interrupt Handler takes a look at the inner of the vector and it says out. I just got to interrupt. Where is it from it? I can look at it be interrupted is kind of recorded information about his record in the processor and the processor can say no this isn't enough for my GPU and then the owner of the vector will transfer control of the GPU driver and a GPU driver. Will they know what to do? Because it initiated the original being a request and I'll go ahead and finish it.  This is disruptive. So if you have lots of interrupts, it's like a contact switch for a system call sonar processing take some time. And so if you have lots of interrupts coming in, I can be pretty expensive.  That's how we communicate with Hardware kind of logically the way we actually hook things up is we want to get stuff as close to the processor as possible. So this is an Intel Sandy Bridge processor for about 5 years ago. It has four corners and this is a machine for a private desktop desktop computer may be a laptop and actually has an integrated graphics card.  So Never chords up here. These are the cars are talked about as a graphics card over here and actually share the L3 cache that I can communicate very quickly. This is nice because I'm really close so I can communicate very low latency very high bandwidth. It reduces the cost of the system because if I buy this ship, I don't have to buy a separate graphics card so I can go to for laptop. You restrict some flexibility, right? Because this is not a great of obviously if I want a new graphics card, I can't go and replace it because it's bacon in the Silicon.  But this is house in this is how I know. This is something like what you're the chip in your cell phone looks like it doesn't integrated GPU as well. I don't have a bunch of other stuff in there an addition to that. There's some other stuff over here. This is the memory controller is how you talk to dram and then write a box they talk about communicating over what's called witches direct memory interface and then in a more modern processor a big Silver Machine, there'll also be a bunch of pubes spell pcie right seems like it should be easy pcie2 all the stuff off of a dry.  Off the ship. There is some more stuff. I just called the chipset. It's a lot slower because it's takes a lot of time to send data over wires that go to the process turn over to another piece of silicon because they're slower clocks because it's hard to send a clock a long way over big wire. I was also longer latency because there's extra logic involved and also it just take some extra time to drive the wires with his much.  You need to get a good down at the cross the bus come over here in the chipset is where all the really slow stuff happened. So USB is actually really slow by the standards of the rest of the machine. Just got out of slow power management the real time clock status monitoring and it's all connected to the CPU by a connection. That's about 4 gigabytes a second. So all the start of slow IO devices hang off of this site chips that thing  so here's a picture of a cartoon of a modern a processor. This is Intel E 1200. This is thinking about a year ago.  Maybe less this is a sky like if you follow that kind of thing as chipset over here. So if you look at a motherboard, there's like the big giant thing under the giant he think it over the size of a little chip on the side without a bank of the brain that much power they're connected over something called Emi which is a chance for direct memory direct memory interface, I believe and then we have a bunch of stuff hanging off of here. So there is there's the Audio car that I bought from the guy in the parking lot bunch of PCI Express Lanes are some hard drive ports. All the other stuff is a bunch of other small peripherals. There's things like fan controllers in temperature monitors and all kinds of stuff that are hooked up here in a grated ethernet and a whole bunch of USB ports.  All of the girls in the South Bridge in this used to be called the Southbridge appear on the processor. We have a bunch more pcie Express Pizza Express Lanes. That's where the fast stuff goes and there might be like 80 of these atpc lanes and I'll be a bunch of deer and that's it. Stop there as well.  Hold on.  So we're going to talk in particular about 1.  particular kind of IO device  psych not really close. Don't worry.  All right.  All right. So so persistent that we talked to in big servers their disc there are graphics cards and their network cards talk about storage and M disk data bytes of data in 2008. I think that's something like 23 zeros or something after the after the 9th. I think this was increasing apps.  Does increasing at something like 20% of years, so I was 10 years ago. So it's 20% of your means. It's doubled like three times since then or so, so maybe 30 Bennett 30 petabytes petabytes of Zeta 30 petabytes of data processing and  give me a prayer.  Find somebody somewhere to store it.  To the place where I started for a long time was on disk. So this is a graph we have a Christmas production year going from about 1955 in the IBM Remick was the first hard disk drive. It was a size of a refrigerator and nowadays since then. This is a log scale up here and we have been this ends in about 2009 or so friends are actually more or less continuing and you can see this is density increasing exponentially over the course of like 50 or 60 years now and so things have gotten about a factor of 8.5 million which is pretty impressive. And now we have I think the biggest Drive I saw when I was looking at this for some really resides or something like 14 terabytes in one package about this big man original Ram at calth. I don't know I guess we can try to figure it out on here, but it was I was like, I don't know 40 megabytes or something.  This is the cost in price for megabytes measured in dollars over from 1990 to 2010. What kind of interesting is that this yellow bar here. This is the cost of paper.  And so sometime in the early 2002 became much cheaper to store stuff on disc going to do the stored on paper. And now you know, what kind of screaming toward zero and sewing in short order cost almost nothing to store stuff. You can go and buy from a cloud provider. You can pay I think I pay like $5 a year for like a hundred terabytes of storage on iCloud or Google cloud or maybe both of them because it's so cheap so hard drives are really amazing if you want to store a lots and lots and lots of data.  The problem is that they're really slow as a couple of reasons that they're slow. The main one is at the Disco itself has moving parts, right? So we have a spinning platter in there if trolling around at between between like 5,000 + 15000 RPM. So it's going really really fast and then this other thing this piece right here is called the arm at the very end of it. There is a little thing called the rehab to read and write hard and as they are moving back and forth. It can sweep that had across the surface of a disk.  So they move really fast by the standards of physical things that we move but they're actually pretty slow by the standards of like electron zipping around inside of copper wire or something so they will be around so you put in like a big high end server the date of a revolution away. So I sat average it's over there, right and sometimes it's worse and sometimes it's better. And so that ends up about two milliseconds away. So just waiting for the day to do you make the long trip around the disc to come back to the one place where you can read it takes quite a while.  How do you say all you can spin faster turns out that power consumption limit spindle speed So the faster you spend the platters the more drag their is on the platters and they have to spin faster and faster Dragon creases from like with the square of the velocity. And so you don't mean a lot of a lot of a lot of power to make it go faster. If you go fast enough the the start of actual actually flutter, which is really bad for a ways away from its more power. So one very interesting question is why don't we run the hard drives in a vacuum and the answer to this when I found this out completely blew my mind.  So I have a disc.  It is extraordinary lie flat on its finest actually made out of it's like a little bit. I'm some kind of metal or ceramic then on top of that. There's a layer of iron oxide what you can on your thighs and then there's a layer of this very highly engineered lubricant actually and then on top of that there's nothing on top of that right head is basically a little electromagnet and what you're going to do is we're going to bring the head right down next to the surface of the disk and we are going to talk all that electromagnet back and forth and it's going to magnetize a surface of the Disco little bit the closer we can get it the smaller the bits that we can right onto the disc because the more focused we can make our a magnetic field. So we want the drive had to be very very close to the platter.  Tell the platter that for this the kind of analogy that I've heard is that if you imagined.  If you scale this up so that the reidhead was a size of like a commercial jet that it would be flying about seven hundred miles an hour and it would be about a half inch off the ground and it wouldn't very by more than about an eighth of an inch. Right? So it's going really really fast. It's very very close and if it touches the platter it will tell the head crash and it will start destroying Davis. That's very bad. So how do you maintain this like perfect Gap and the answer is at the head flies. So the head is like actually are dynamically designed to Coast on something called an air bearing which holds it at just this right level above the surface of a drive. So if you run it in a vacuum, there's no air bearing and the the hard drive or the head will crash into the drive. Yes.  They do sell them with helium this year saw the first appearance of a helium-filled drive, which is the the the cause of a lot of like, you know, interesting conversation of the big hard drive conference. How many of you have ever owned an iPod that actually had a hard drive in it?  A few of you. So if you look on the specs it tells you that there is a maximum operating altitude for your iPod.  And the reason for that is if you go to High the air is too thin and your head will crash into your desk because they are bearing isn't strong enough. So you can't take your your old iPhone iPod up to the top of Mount Everest or or bad things will happen. All right, so we can vacuum. Unfortunately, we can't put helium in which will help a little bit. This is probably out of date. This is probably about 3x higher now on this is how many track Sprint so this is how precisely I have to position that reidhead and so it can it can position the head within about a hundred and seventy-five. Nanometers is probably there's some reason this at this number is actually not decreasing as quickly as this number is increasing not going to go to that with any now a hundred nanometers are sound and it's able to do that in between between 3 and 13 milliseconds.  And I can sell it back and forth. This is maybe the the distance here is maybe a 2in or maybe an inch and a half with a hundred meter accuracy in a small number of milliseconds glacially slow compared to the rest of the computer system. So we go through a lot of effort to make it look faster on the way we do this is using your old friend of a cash. So everything tries to cash just accesses because they are so terribly terribly slow. So there is a disk or there's a there's a there's a non disc deer and buffer that does a little bit of cashing on if you have a high in system. There will be a hard drive controller and maybe hooks up to a bunch of hard drives for his we'll talk about it and it will have a battery back dere am on there. And that means that when I write some data and I say to my hard drive controller used to make totally certain that you're not going to lose this data because it has my most recent bank statement in it.  The hard drive controller say hey, no problem. I just wrote it in gear and but I have a battery. So if things crash the system goes down the date it will stay here for a day or two and hopefully your systems administrator will come back and restart everything will be okay the operating system that also does a bunch of cashing in the middle. Also go to the operating system also goes to a lot of trouble to try to schedule accesses so that it tries to arrange things so that if I have several access is around here. It will try to schedule them so that I can kind of hit them as I go by as the disc spins around and that'll save me some time.  All right for this are slow to start to slow. So the way to make them fasters to use lots of them. This is very much the idea of using multiple cars to drive to LA to go faster. So you're not going to get there any faster, but you can get more stuff there in the same amount of time. So the way that we do this is called raid since for redundant array of independent or maybe inexpensive the acronym acronym is changed over time discs in back in late 80s early 90s. Please many you'll get a multiplicative increasing bandwidth. You'll get a multiplicative increase the number of operations you can do for second. We won't have it won't give you any help for latency. And the other thing that they were particularly interested in a first design. This idea was there instead of increasing reliability because the death of the time we're big and very expensive the reliable just for big and very expensive, but they're really  Upstart Drive manufacturers for making these cheaper drive it's worth so reliable and so it was like well, how can we use some of those cheaper drives to build a reliable storage device? And so we'll see we're going to replicate it across disks. I'm going to be clever about how we started this with one of the disks dies. We can recover some of the data we can recover all the data that we lost.  Describe this taxonomy of different raid levels, and they are all kind of different ways of organizing data on a disc to increase reliability and hopefully increase performance.  I'm So Into regardless of what what r a w using the whole rate of Ray appears is like one big kind of virtual pseudo disc and so dangerous are still appears as one big long kind of linear array of bytes or blocks that you can that you can access. The first grade level is Raid 0 and the way this works is I have 2 discs this year in just one and I just sort of stripe the data across the desk. So the first block a one goes here a 2A, 3A 4A 5A 6A 7A 8.  If I have in discs are the ends black vegans block lives on the disc, this is actually worse for reliability. Right? So if I have two drives, it's more likely that one of them if I just have one drive and so if I lose one of the disks, then I lose half my data and it's like every other page of data, right? So good luck recovering Your Word file if you're missing every other 4 kilobytes for reliability, we can do raid 1 and hearing mirror the data so 18th two copies of everything.  That means you have 2 discs, but you only have the capacity of one disc. But if you have a disk failure you are okay because you have a second copy sitting there ready to go you get double the bandwidth for Reed's you get the same down with four right? Cuz I could read from either desk right if I need if I want to read a 1 and 1/4 the same time I could issue those requests to two different drives.  The next one of the one that people have the first of the people really is not in practice is called raid 5 so I don't remember actually don't know what Raid 2 and 3 are rainforests kind of a dumber version of r a v i v works is you have a bunch of disks. And we're going to do is we're going to strike the date across to a 1 to 3. And then the last disk we're going to start the parody of that data and what the parody means is that I look at the first bit of a won the first bit of a 2in the first bit of a three and I add up those bet I can actually count the number of ones across those corresponding bits of each of those of those pieces of data and I put a 1 or a 0  In the parody drive to make it so that the total number of ones across that stripe is even or is even and then the next one. I have a B1 B2. I put the Perry on different drive and I'll beat you over here and I should have continued this this plant inside of the parody of sort of spread across the different dry and the date of the stripe across the drives. I like it. A lot of drugs. I could have a hundred Drive is in my RAID 5 array and it worked just fine. Now the cool thing is that if I lose one of my drive so one of my drive to die, so just happened. I turn on my computer and data doesn't turn on since I have this parody information. I can recalculate the contents of this drive by looking at the contents of all the other drives. I'll just look around look at those bits and I'll say oh there is an odd number of bits on the drive that survived. So this must be at 1 so that parody is preserved.  And so I can very easily regenerate the date of that. I've lost right that makes sense.  Yes.  So for each bit, I know so far the first bit of all the drives rats. Look at the very first pic. I I wrote my data.  Which is this orange stuff here and then I set the last bit so that the number of one's is even so if there's an odd number of there's an even number of ones I put a zero there.  And that's out in varying on that those that set of Bits And if I lose one of them I can tell you. Oh well because I know what the other ones were I can tell you this one must be a one or a zero, whatever is necessary to preserve parody. Yes.  No, you can make amends because you want why did you why do you think it would be limited?  Remind them all up cuz I keep at least one very good and I say you run out of II just in case I will never run out.  No matter how big my drives are right, so I'll go like this and I'll just start over again.  Play the parody of stripe across the drive.  so  You know, there's each of these types of this is like analysis chunk one actually called strips. This is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 + strip. I have this parody invariant that I maintain and so I can have as many strips as I want.  terabytes in terabytes of them  So I'm so this is what people use for a long time. This works really. Well. I like I said, I could have a hundred drives. The the storage overhead is low right? It's one over and if I have them drives have a bigger write a very little wasted space. I have a lot. I don't know. I don't know if I have a lot of bandwidth. I don't get a lot of extra so I can get some extra bandwidth on Reed's cuz I can read from the drive independent in a lot of cases of things that happened was it just drives kept getting bigger and bigger and you'll notice that I didn't show you a graph of improving just drive performance over the last 50 years because this guy performance has not improved over the last 50 years. So just try performances basically constant, but if you look back at this graph  This graph tells me that this capacity is growing exponentially. So if I have a situation or one of my hard drive dies, one of my hard drives dies and I lose this disk.  What do I have to do? Right I have to go and I have to read my entire array. I have to read all of the data across all of my dry so that I can recompute the parody. So if I have a hundred discs.  And they are 10 terabyte each. I have a petabyte of data. I have to read and do computation on then I have to write out another 10 terabytes of data are two problems with this. One of them will take a very long time. Right? Cuz I'm reading are like two hundred mile have a hundred drives. I really like to gigabyte II it'll still take maybe a day or so to recover the drive. The second problem is that the reason of this improves reliability is because I say, oh well, if I lose a drive I can just recover it. But if I have a hundred drives and if drives fail once every five years, but me and you know, the chances of me losing OneDrive are pretty small, but it'll it's going to happen. Then I can go into recovery mode. But what is the chance that I'm going to lose a second Drive during the day that it takes me to recover the first drive.  Thomas drive to get bigger that probability actually goes up exponentially because my drive capacity is going up exponentially. So what they've done is they have a second grade 6 in Paradis drive and if you go and try to make this work with normal parody where you're just adding the bit to make the number of lunch or not to be even you'll find out that doesn't work until they do something complicated with like galois Theory galois field and number Theory and stuff that I really understand but it's basically the same idea so I can lose one drive and then the second spare drive that I had the second redundant Drive protect me while I'm recovering the first one.  Yes.  Charade for doesn't start prepared events rain five stripes and the reason is that in raid.  If I want to do a store or right let's I want to update a one.  Write a one that means I also have to update a p in fact anytime. I have to say to A-1 a-2 a-3. I have to update a p and tell him I put all the parody over here. I just have a parody Drive the parody Drive is getting pounded on all the time because every right has to go there if I stripe it like this then every time I ride I have to do every right has to go to to drive but it's going to change the disk 0 industry. If I have to be to I have to use disc to disc 1 and disc 2. And so that spreads out that concentration of parody traffic parade for does exactly what you said. And of course they said well, that's a bad idea because of the  That's right. That's how we store data reliably upscale.  It's still slow. This are still like glacially even Raider razor glacially terribly slow.  So the new thing is Splash used to be new or now. It's kind of old all of your own flash drives when I started teaching this class in like 2007. No one on flash drives and they really really taking over. So they're everywhere they are in your media player. That's kind of where they got their big stars. They are in your thumb drives are in your cell phones are in your ssds in your big servers and your laptops then your tablet and everything else.  So flashes really fast.  So this is some data updated this in my home out of date.  2018 this is 2.2 GB per second. This is a hundred and this is 500x.  So I can have a raid array. This is a RAID array of 4 drives.  If I'm doing random for Club, I read between time reading data at random, which is something just happened to be really really bad at I will get a total bandwidth of 2.6. Megabytes per second out of that raid array, you know, this is a drive now that you can buy for I think they cost like a hundred bucks. You can stick it in your laptop ittle Dew 2 gigabytes a second. It's a hundred times faster in terms of latency. 500 times faster. The flash is like everywhere the cloud runs on flash. Now for the most part of at least the stuff that you need good performance from all your laptop's all your desktop machines. It's actually on a hard drive.  A few of you. Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now I'm saying what?  I have so many hard drives fail on me. I have three felony in a month. It was like a running joke in my lab. Like I kept buying these backup hard drive. I just keep buying them. They just keep dying. Like there's a couple of different ways of things can fail.  So hard drive is usually fail mechanically. Well, actually they do often fail. Mechanically that happens a lot. It'll just stopped working and you can open up in the head is like sitting there like shaking like a touch too much coffee or something or just don't spin off. It'll make the click of death. So hard drives fail a lot. So it was I think 20 or so drives in it. We have it loaded with so you build this real so I put some things in called hot spares another hard drives are not using but the RAID controller can tell and hard drives fail to automatically start doing a rebuilt if something goes wrong and we have to replace them probably once a year. So we're losing out to drives a year out of our raid array.  How to spell irate seems a little bit hi to me. I don't know why it's high but it seems like it is so and when you lose a hard drive, you lose all the date on the hard drive the mechanic stop working at Dusty's can fail and the other thing that can go wrong in a hard drive or SSD is there is actually a lot of software running on any storage device owe hundreds of thousands of lines of code are running on your hard drive even more is running on your SSD and there can be bugs in the software that can cause your hard drive to stop working or the corrupt data are for real things to go all kinds of Haywire.  So I can happen to have natural experiment that happen when people switch over from hard drives for ssds and the big question was like our is at the mechanics or is it the software something else and hard drive is failing all the time. It was about half of it was mechanical because the failure rate kind of went down by about half when he went ssds right cuz only mechanical stuff went away on the software is way more complicated seasonal talk about what it has to do in a moment. And so I don't know how you balance that out. So they're question that you were like, that's true. I don't talk about why that's true in a couple slides.  So if you are a commercial storage provider you will be dealing with reliability multiple levels. So try to find Reliable hard drives in raid on top of them and it probably replicate your data across like data centers on different continents ride in case a meteor hits or something. And so that's kind of value start thinking about that money thing about us a sneeze is it if you fear a person like an individual and you want to save like your pictures of your kid or something like a flash drive and up shoe boxes a really bad idea because the life time is like the rated lifetime is 10 years. Like that's the the like light up there telling you and the actual reality is that it's much worse.  So, you know, my dad has probably like what size should I store my data on a CDR? Do you know the city are as anymore? Right? And I was like nah, those are actually pretty susceptible to oxidation. They go bad drivers local hard drives can fail like what about flash light flashes really bad? Like what should I do like you to put on Google Drive because Google Drive has a bunch of really smart highly motivated people keeping that data Seyfried and that's really what it takes to preserve data. All right.  So we're just share everything on Facebook. And then the whole world will have it'll be fine. I'm really cool storage systems. Actually. They have a giant Blu-ray juke box that holds the deep deep Cold Storage photos and no one ever looks like looks at the favourite click on a photo in Facebook and it takes like 30 seconds for it to load. That's because there is a robot in a warehouse somewhere screaming down this aisle picking a Blu-ray disc out of a little slot and then sticking it into a Blu-ray drive so they can read the data out of it.  I'm alright, so here's how flash work so that flashes of memory technology which means of restoring data and silicon.  Almond slices pretty clever so that way it works is we have a transistor. This is John and as for the symbol for a transistor and a normal transistor, we have the control they don't have the channel and if we apply a voltage to the gate we can turn the transistor on and off right that's just basic transistor stuff. We talked about the beauty of the course.  In a Flash device reaction something called a floating gate transistor another piece of metal sits right here and as the picture suggests this piece of metal is electrically isolated. So it's surrounded on all sides by insulator So in theory, there is no way to get charged on and off of that floating gate.  But in fact, we live in a quantum-mechanical world. And so if you apply a large voltage to the gate like 20 volts, which is a gigantic voltage in terms of like a silicon devices like your CPU run the like 1.2 volt volt electrons through the ventilator on to that isolated piece of metal and then if you turn off at 20 volts will just sit there because there's nowhere for it to go right? It's for the better and that's how you persistently store data inside a transistor.  So we have this funny operations in a flash of a program operation. And then we have what we call in a race operation where we applied 20 volts to the back side and 0 volts to the gate and I will basically pull the electrons off of the gate. Now. If you are a couple different kinds of flash flash devices, they work in different ways. But the basic idea is it you do some violence to some electrons and you force them on to this piece of floating of isolated metal and then the trick is it because there is discharge sitting here or an absence of charge the presence or absence of charging this phone and gave effects of switching characteristics of the transistor so I can go and I can try to turn the transistor on and off and if there's charge and it's kind of depends on the particular device be an author's charge here. Maybe that means you can't turn on or you can turn it off or one of the other and then that means if I run out of a small I try to run a small current through the transistor I can see whether or not  Data came through that will read the value that was stored on that floating gate.  And then it can get stuck up. It ends up looking like this is how you build a lithographic Lee. They're the source and the drain is a floating gate. Here's the external gate and there's the word line that attaches to it.  We talked earlier about memory eraser. We're going to build a giant array of these and again just like with all the other memory arrays we're going to try to optimize for density. So what we do in Flash is first revealed something call Dan and Shane. This is a whole bunch of these floating Point folding gate transistors attached and in the end because this is what it looks like in seamoth.  I'm going to start date on all of them there two transistors of the top. These are normal transistors are called select transistors. Look at what those do in a minute stamp out a bunch of chains in parallel basically pave the world in this way with floating gate transistors levels of organization in Flash. There is one thing called a block that's his blue box here and that is all of the all of the these flash change that we stack up next to each other. They're probably  What's it going to be at 16 x a this is 128 + 128000 will stack up next to each other in a row and then we'll be one slice across all of those chains on this will be something like I think now there's like 16 kilobytes or so.  And so that's the sort of units of access. It was also we built for the basic building block for a flasher relay is one block at a whole bunch of blocks from the Block movie 16000 blocks on one flash dip and then  Down there. We have it. We talked about word Lions, they'll be an infant lines will be weird lines that run across the the blocks and then there are bit lions are in all the way down and they select transistors hook One of These Chains up to one of those bit lines. So you kind of like a little switching yard or something you connected some of the Beltline and that's what's going to get red out at the bottom of the array atticus's the sentence just like we had was d'ram restroom or whatever. The reading process is. Basically the same as much detail as we're going to go into  So what I do is I light up a word line. I write up the select transistors look up to the midline. And then I try to drive a current along that Nan Shan and I try to turn turn all of the transistors on so the data can flow and I try to turn one of them off and the one that I read is when I try to turn off and if I can turn off now if you want if I can't turn off in at the zero so I can I can read one of those pets.  So they're in dire a mess around there are two different memory operations, but in Flash there are three.  So we have these blocks. We have the pages that are striped across the blocks.  So we have two different pages. This is one page by page on their page. So their operations we can perform our first we can erase an entire block and erase for reasons, which I do not understand but someone made the decision a long time ago iRacing set the block tall ones the entire block all of the transistors get erased it one time and then you can program individual pages, but you have to program them in order starting from page 0 episode of right now, I have to go down there tomorrow and once you're done with that one, then you can go and you can ride into some other block, but you'll have to do it in order.  So this is a big pain.  Friends will get into but that's how it works program and read.  Forget the little bit more complicated because you can actually store multiple bits in each of those cells. So this is another terrible naming convention. Mlc was totally not invented by a computer server flash was totally not invented by a computer scientist to the names are terrible. The first option is called single-level cell with Shores one bit at already run into problems because single because the one bit actually requires two levels  So single of a spell already doesn't make sense, but still holds one bit multi-level cell which has actually four levels will two bits. So they like went from two specific to way to General and then I went to Triple level cell which will 3 minutes but actually has eight levels. So that means actually that there are more there's bits for multiple Pages stored in each each of these floating gate devices.  Casino level sells the most reliable in the fastest. You may have heard that flash has a reliability problem. It totally does.  So if I go back here here is the problem.  The problem is it as I'm I'm abusing my flash device by pushing. These Giants are voltages around pulling the current through The Insider actually damages the insulator and so the other night at the more I erase and forgot my flash device the more likely it is that the electrons will just sort of tunnel off or conduct off of it is sitting there and after a while the flash device becomes so unreliable it wants to date anymore.  Because of this there is a limited lifetime. No boy. Totally got ahead of myself.  Prairie lifetime for Flash device is so single-level cell you can program in the race about a hundred thousand times. We had dinner attention time of 10 years. It takes about 25 microseconds to the right.  These graphs I'm going to show you this is the distribution. This is like a histogram.  Epoxy likelihood of there being a particular number of a particular amount of charge on the floating gate. So I'm going to try to pull these electrons until I get some distribution, you know, sometimes I'll be a little more supposed to be a little less but they did I say something is over here in the high and there's going to be so I make sure that I can always tell the difference between the two.  If I go to two bits for salad for levels, my endurance goes down by about a factor of 10. I date or tension time jobs by three real agency is basically the same in my right latency goes up like part of that. Also. I have to become more precise. This is why rights are slower because I have less I have to have a smaller Target the gaps become near where this is why are reliability goes down because they're getting closer together. And if I got a triple-double sell things get even worse right now. I have eight levels.  I can ride a triple triple oval sell about 500 times before it becomes pretty unreliable detention time is 3 years free time is now pretty long. And now the program time is getting pretty high as well 660 500 microseconds that is 6.5 milliseconds to see things are getting very very slow. Nothing good happens at the difference between 0 electrons and a lot of electrons is like a hundred electrons when things get really tiny. So we're talking about the the difference of the location of a single electron on and off of that on top of that pudding Gabe know these gaps are super tiny and some things get a little bit hairy back kisses like in 2009 or so, we built a little test rigged and we were going to measure the bitrate and performance and memory energy consumption of class ships.  We built this little Pastor card and we put a multilevel cell flash device on it.  And we were selling leave at the spill soda and they came back in like there was like they are it was like 1 x 10 to the -4 sounds something. So like one and every 10000 bits we got back was wrong and I was like graduate students and then was Joel. I was like Joel something is wrong with your PCP. You need to go and fix it. And so we weren't any work and trying to fix it and try to fix it and he couldn't fix it. And finally we talked to some folks initials like hell. Yeah, of course, that's the error rate for a flash joke like brand new Flash when I get a 5 is really really high for an hour a day just do error correction on top of it. So things start up pretty bad. It's not like, you know how to get to 5000 the wheels fall off the wheel start falling off a long long time earlier. It's by the time you get to 500. They've almost certainly all come off is kind of what this means.  All right. So for a while things are looking pretty dire for Flash member actually wrote a paper once called The Bleak future of nand flash memory the most embarrassing thing I've ever ridden because I totally didn't happen things went great because we went 3D  this is really cool. So the problem wasn't the flash sales are getting so tiny and the number of electrons was so small in the leakage off of them was so large that it became really hard to see how we were going to go to make things go farther. So but never count out never bet against, you know, a hundred billion dollar industry rights of people worked on this for a long time and what they've done now, they've stocks of the bits vertically is one man chain in each one of these sets of Stripes is one of these floating Gates transistors and this is like a drawing this is actually looks like a few slice to one of these things. So these columns there a little bit bigger than individual flash sales to the density of this is a few years old now is between 2 and 4x. So you get a lot more bits into place. You can go buy ssds Basin Us. In fact, it's probably in some of your phones and laptops right now.  They've got this is again all their 24 layers. People are talking about a hundred layers stacking this up higher and higher. So one of the key this is really cool because one of the key pieces of reasoning behind this paper, I wrote was that if you look at total semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the world and you look at how much disk capacity is built. There is no way that flash is ever going to replace this because we need to increase the Silicon manufacturing capacity like a factor of 50 right in each of those Fab's cost like $20 with a B20 billion dollars.  And all of a sudden you get like a 24 X increase in effective siliconera that your building and now pow like you can think about replacing disc with flash because you can move into the third dimension. This is you know, this thing's got everything got better. They got faster liability and proved it was like magic and so things that look for Flash looks looks know. It's a lot lot better than throwing a lot of a lot of devices. They're replacing discs a wholesaler still uses for archives and so forth, but the future is not especially bright.  All right.  The wingspan of a couple of ways we are program a race where there talked about. I was also something called program disturb. I'm going to cuz running out of time, but I want to tell you how you make a flash SSD flash strips for the basic problem here is that we have a disc disc is how long to actually still how machines are processors want to talk to persistent storage and you can read a desk and you can write a desk to have a flat address space. It's made of a things called sectors are usually 512 lights are getting bigger. Now, maybe it's for kilobytes limitations. You can write it as much as you would like anyone ever wear out to a flash device.  Which you read pages white pages in a race blocks hear this weird hierarchical addressing scheme, and he also the problem that if you write to the same thing over and over again, it will fail and I'll actually feel pretty fast rights of Madden are files on your computer that you have overridden easily 500 times and if it was always wrote to the same piece of flash that file would wear out and you did it would be gone. So, we have to fix this we have to use this which is a big mess and we have to somehow emulate this disk, which is a lot cleaner. So this is basically how this works. So the operating system when it looks  Add a hard drive if these what's called a logical block address base. I'm not as a linear array of blocks blocks 0 1 2 3 4 on a hard drive those blocks map directly to pieces of the hardware on the fixies on the outside edge of the disc and block, you know, 12 terabytes is on the inside of the reins very nicely across the across the entire Drive either way. It's going to work is the operating system is going to see a linear block device. But the solid state drive inside is going to be completely emulate that kind of create that illusion didn't really finish playing very different. So it's going to maintain a mapping between these logical block address is an actual physical storage location.  And so when I do a right, it's alright this bluedata. Yes. I still say OK you rode 2/5. I will store this here and I will make a note but I Store and Lock 5 into location zero and then if you write block 5 again on a hard drive with leftover write the date of it here, I will say, okay, I'll put your new version of block 5 in Block 5 into page and I'll update my map to make sure I know where that date is. I'll keep doing this eventually. I will run out of space, right cuz I'm storing all the old versions of your data and I'll have to go through and start reclaiming this stale data.  So it looks like we have the software up here and user space says the application or the or the or the operating system. There's a thing called a flash translation layer, which is a very complicated piece of firmware that runs on the SSD and it's actually what axis is The Flash?  BFDI yellow is responsible for making things fast. It's responsible for being aware of all the details of the rules about accessing the flash memory. It'll write the pages in order. I'll do the deals with the mismatch between a race and program granularity and also should guarantee that your SSD is not going to wear up. I started spreading out all the right that you perform to your device.  So here's an example of how does this please? This is actually my first baby slide. This is kind of state-of-the-art and now it's super simple by comparison, but the basic idea is we have a map.  And it Maps logical block addresses to physical page addresses and I mean to the block and some page inside the block. The block is erased. So this could be an empty block. It has no data work and have data and I'll tell me how many times it's been erased. This is how worn out that block is. It'll tell me how many valid Pages there are because we go in and we write new versions of data the old version of the day to become invalid and so we can get rid of them. And then it'll also have a bar that says whether it's a bad block because blocks we're out and they die or they stop being reliable and so will mark them as bad and I don't use them anymore.  Also maintain rid of an ocean of the current block which is where we are currently writing and we don't have a thing called a right point that points to the current next page that we should write to inside that block.  So if I wanted to read it, very easy. I just look up in the stable and then I go and I read the data that I want. That's no problem. If I want to do it, right and my right point is pointing to the middle of the block. Well the first thing I do.  I'm going to write to this block right here. The first thing I do is I invalidate what I had before so I have two kids of the address to K. I change it from being blocked a002 being blocked too far. Cuz that happens to beer. I wrote to adjust then now in the old block zero I go in my block info table for black zero and I decrement the number of Valley Pages because I just replace something that used to live in Block C rowson. I have one less valid page and block zero and I increments.  The number of valid pages in Block 5 because I just wrote something in the block 5.  And I can keep going eventually. I'll run come to the end of the aisle come to the end of the block down here.  But eventually I will run out of blocks. And so now I have to go and I have to find a block to erase and said I'll look and I'll say what which block should I erase next really good choice would be one like block to that has a lower race count which means it has gotten fewer than its share of erases. So it's not very worn out and it has a low valid page count. So it's not a lot of useful data there a little while do for blocked too as I will copy all of the valid data to the current right point right amount will mean that the number of valid pages into goes to zero and now I can erase to I don't need it anymore.  So this is interesting because what this means I had to spend some time doing this right. I wasted some internal van with copying the old validated into my into the Kern right point.  And that has some unfortunates performance consequences. So one thing that happens if the hard drive won't think about the same time, I can plot the distribution of latency vs. Latency and it looks something like this.  Ride, this is how long it'll take they're actually look quite like that. It look like this.  Also right in that means that you know, it's never going to go super fast. It'll be a pretty narrow distribution of how long those accesses will take for an SSD. The picture is pretty different. I can be so for an SSD most of the time it'll be really fast.  long tail  Let's tell an old crappy ssds this congratulate 3 seconds.  Because you can get to this place where your hard your SSD is totally out of pages of block the Rays box and you heard a bunch of rights to all the go and I'll start doing this garbage collection process to free up blocks will do this for a second and second or two and you're driving just for the go out to lunch and come back in a while and service your request. So this has long tail. This is been a big problem for people that want to use ssds. So for instance Facebook on Facebook or anyone else they got their going to build a new, you know, giant Datacenter going to have a hundred thousand machines and it takes a couple years of planning and one of the things I do in planning is they put out a request for products to hard drive hardware manufacturers and one of them is for SSD that says we want ssds we're going to buy a whole lot of ssds, but we want them to have these characteristics. We would like them to have an average latency that is 15 microseconds and we would like to have a tail light and see which means that the slowest  1% of accesses. I would like to pay Lindsay to be less than 1 millisecond. And what happened was failing to become such a big problem that in these requests for products what the what they started saying was you can make the average case significantly slower. So 200 microseconds is okay as long as it's hailing so you shorter so I want a tighter Distribution on how long it takes me to do one of these accesses and the reason for their said that if your Facebook right, so I'll see you go to Facebook and you click on your profile and it's going to go and it's going to load pictures. I don't know what the number is with us. Probably like a hundred 50 pictures that needs to load a hundred a hundred fifty things that needs to load to give you a Facebook to render one Facebook page.  So how long does it take that page to load? Will the total load time is a German by the leave the time it takes for the slowest thing on my page to load and if one and a hundred of my things takes 3 seconds, and I'm quoting a hundred things that on average a low time is going to be like 3 seconds. So because you want to have you want these web web services to be super responsive. You actually need to bring in this tale agency and make it as tight as possible so that all of your exes will finish within some reasonably short window and so is a Consul, you know, this is been this kind of ongoing Evolution and arms race over the last 10 years or so of people building more and more complicated at y'all's trying to reduce high latency increase reliability really make things can work in Sisseton and better and I've got enormously complicated usually several million lines of code running inside of typical.  All right. We are out of Time. Come on Thursday for the guest lecture about machine learning accelerators and come next week for security and final review.  And if you need special accommodation for the "
