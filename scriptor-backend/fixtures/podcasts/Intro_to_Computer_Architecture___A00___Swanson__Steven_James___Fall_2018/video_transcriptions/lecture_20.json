Otherwise, it's a girl gender for my mouth.  Chick-fil-A sandwich  homework 7-1, I just had my pencil.  Oh, no.  So while I'm on her gum.  Is that homework 7?  All right.  Homework 7 which one? Sorry.  Is right here.  All right.  Who cashes that is 32 kilobytes to a block size of one word through two bits for a back policy and 1 C is how many bits are needed him Samantha D cash  All right for the phone number of blocks?  All right. So the D cash is  a box has that one wears is 32/5 or 4X?  So the first thing you want to do is finish for trying to calculate the total capacity of the are the total number of bits required set includes both the data bits for the storage and for the tag.  telephone number of boxes to the 13th  Does that make sense of data bits and Hold Us 32 bit so there's going to be 32 times this many bits in their the tag is 818 vets in the valley. That is the valid is one valid bit for Block. So that's a total of 1 + 18 + 32 bits for Block + 1 + 18.  And it's one additional bit to say whether the block is dirty because they're doing it right back policy. So that brings it up to a total of 52 bits. And so the total number is 2 to the 13th * 52, whatever that add up to be.  Does that make sense?  Next question. Yes.  I want to start before I get back. See you on the next one, right? All right.  And we don't know the difference is that we don't have to write we don't do we don't ride into the I cash so it needs one less bit for lying. So there's no a dirty bed. Otherwise the map is the same.  All right.  I have two processors and UNC.  Is a faulty call to hit rate times has Miss colors asking for is not using that for me. So I'm wondering why.  All right. Well, let's just look like so we're going to try to calculate the  Tell her I'm trying to calculate the total memory CPI.  Which is the sum of the instruction the data cpi's. With the data CPI. So if we go up here, we will see that here's our Miss rates for the data cache 6% and time is 5 nanoseconds and the access to memory takes 99 seconds.  also start with P one  he won. So what is 180?  motorcycle called a puppy  Okay, so this is the  Of Cycles S6. That's our  cycle counts X by 2  2%  20% of the instructions are memory 20% of them good memory. So that's the number of Cycles times a number of instructions that I can get a memory.  so  Why is this why is it 180?  psycho 4  180 cycle 2. Why did we add one to this?  Or if I if it's what kind of color is Miss Grace comes Miss plus fit red pants fit under entry. Add one more term saying it read his.  We didn't include it. We didn't use this number anywhere.  Gotcha.  So I think my default ahead time is one cycle. I don't see where do we get there?  Where do even incorporate?  Okay.  So I think there's been a little bit of confusion about this. I think about the exact whether you add in the bass the bass time so on that the bay cycle time, so just be clear about this on the final to make it clear what we want and we'll be a little bit lenient probably a few are off by 1 or something that you understand that to get the total memory CPI you add them together and that you were taking into account the fraction of instructions that are affected and the Miss raid and access time. Yes.  Usually you add the base has always wanted it sort of usually as we talked about. It includes the it's been kind of included by default because he instruction goes to the memory stage notes way through the pipeline.  yummy sandwich  I don't know questions because our final is so far away.  It's like eight days away. Yes.  Undetermined. As I said last time what we do is when we make them when we take the when you're crazy homework questions and then we take some of those we put them on the midterm. We should take some more of us left. I put on the final so I'll be some biased towards post midterm material, but probably not very much.  sandwich  Yes.  tequila B&L wine Cairo  That is a good question.  The answer should be there should be so this so this is the cash. This is the L1 access time which is 10 nanoseconds in the tlb access time, which is 700 seconds. And so it should actually be the  The max of those two, so it should be 69 seconds inside of 1500 seconds.  Yes.  It is it's not a rule of thumb so much as it is what happens when you have a virtually index and physically typed cash so ideas that I can use a virtual address to look up in the tlb. And so I can do the translation that he'll be at the same time as I do my cash access and then I do the tag check when they're both finished. So in a virtually next physically tired cash, it is always the case that you should take the max. If you have a physically index physically tag cash so that the translation is already done because it happened before so then it's just the access time for the cash that you don't have to pay the tlb time again.  Will never saw the final better than reality. There's actually usually a nail to tlv also.  Which makes it a little more complicated, but don't worry about that.  Yes.  Sure.  Wow, a two-way set associative tlb. That's crazy.  What is the question?  I was confused by.  I'm just confused by how to properly lay.  We had our virtual memory access and I was it.  Okay.  Sorry, we have our entries up here on top.  We are going to fill in this table. I guess what it would we give you do. We give you the First Column right? Just the first one.  I can't actually tell cuz I didn't highlight that the key in the second two columns. Is that right?  I was just going to miss.  We didn't okay, we gave you the result.  That was nice of us. So we start off we're going to be Dad, too.  And so what do we do? Well, first of all, we need to calculate the index.  So what is the index index for b-dub to a translations to a four?  Oh my gosh. Does anyone know offhand what the  taggiz  That's a terrible set of values to give it's like what there's two way set associative 8 translations.  So we need two bits.  so this is  so the UPS  Okay.  Please go away.  So what is Consignment M20 now handle the indexes for be Dead 2?  3 thank you. So we look here and we find that.  The we have Services the basically the tag.  any check  what is why is there no tag how to sign out of tag?  Is that your question?  mostly  chili dip in the bottom  So, okay. Thank you can use that. We didn't look good.  I guess the way I reason through this is at all the answers in the table have a 20 minute tag and that their last fits correspond to Deb in Dexter at so I just assumed the last weekend.  Yeah, I mean that's like  so I'll just walk through how this should work. I'm not exactly sure what the tea has had in mind cuz this it seems like there should be a tag but basically said if the index for B12 is 3 then you would go and look here and you would find all right, cuz this is this is the this is the source translation. So if I look up here this doesn't match right because the fish this is a the higher-order bits are the page number so they should match that they don't but I also don't match over here in the second column. So that's a mess. So that's a mess.  The second one is also a mess and we can just check we should look up by visually inspect and see that there's no matches for that tag for 98743 12v.  That's not at 743. So this is a heads cuz I look up here and find that we would extract the index from the border between here and we would look it up and then we can just keep going but I would say this is a poorly structured question cuz it has to be a tag.  Latest didn't label that very well.  next question  sandwich  I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Yes.  I think it's raspberry.  Solid Amber. It's a crunchy all natural peanut butter to on a whole wheat bread healthy.  reasonably, so  I just think this giant peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made on this like molasses Walnut raisin cinnamon bread.  with homemade raspberry jam and  Adams chunky peanut butter  so good my 2000 calories a piece.  how to stop that when I turn 30 or something  They were really good. That was like having cake for lunch.  Yes.  I think that you should read the instructions carefully.  Remarkably small number of people get that question, right?  Yes.  homework 8  how much is his homework 7?  I don't know what I have.  It's Google drive right now.  After like an hour Google Drive is decided to synchronize all my files.  Hello.  Alright, I'm okay.  You said 1 B?  Consider a dual-core processor each car has its own private data cache.  each element symbol  64 bytes cache line size in an induced for bites the following data search for food is stored in memory on a line to a cash leinbach boundary.  Answer the following questions. So you want to be  which one of the given axis has causes a cache Miss on any of the quarters?  All right.  So here's what happens. So we start off everything is invalid. So that's what happens in a an invalid State on each quarter RV Cash live scores. When I write to Foo X or X. It will grab the cash into a known state which means I have the only valid copy of the state on I'm allowed to update it. Then quartullo read from food that will cause that the transition to a shared State on both processors, which means they both have a copy but only  They can only read it and then of Court to write so why then it'll do for a non-state Encore 2 and then if core one reads food on the back to a shared State on both processors. So which of the given access can cause a miss honey of a Corso if it's invalid that I have a mess soak or 1 will cause a miss Core 2  does not cause a miss.  So is afterwards right? So if I am when I do I perform this access everything is an invalid state. So it'll be a mess for further courthouses to be a mess for for one and it because that's your excuse though. Start and then for to this is a Core 2 accessing it Core 2 has it is invalid and so I don't be a menace on for the course of action suit against at the hit or one access is it and it is invalid before that? So it's also a miss.  Oh.  So I guess we should probably say this is a write allocate cache.  Which means that writes to cause Cashman Cashman says there's two choices, right? So you can either there was no I don't know if we talked about right do we talked about right? And I think we just said that its write allocate which means that when you do a right you bring the cash line into the cash before you do the right. Otherwise you can't right to it cuz not there.  Yes.  Is it going to rain in Paris? This is number two is aqua score one instead, of course to state.  And this would remain invalid.  Are you can read or write in another state?  So here what's the number to so what happens is if this core says I need this cash line and it will look up with something called the directory and it will find its Core 1 oz of total send a message to court one and it'll say hey, I want that cash line and Core 100. Okay, I will downgrade myself to a shared State because I'm making a copy and then I'll send it to you or two and then you will have a copy as well as people should stay.  Yes, if it does 441 read through the eyes, is it going to become share or here? That's a good question. So.  so the truth is that there is actually an in a real coherence protocol is probably another state which is using which is  which is called exclusive which means that I have another one that has a copy of it, but it's clean. So we're going to the East State which was an option this question. So I guess if we had said that we would accept either owned or shared.  The Omni more often last thing I do it be just going to a known state.  In court to remain in valentia.  That's for sure cuz car to you don't broadcast your updates to every one of the lies that would you have to broadcast broadcast every update to every memory location, which would cause a lot of extra traffic among the course.  Yes.  Heterogeneous design of this was a good one.  Luke Alvez and I like this question. Okay. So what we what's your question?  Sure. So here's the situation. We want to design a new processor. It's going to be heterogeneous, which means this case that was going to have multiple cores, but they could be a different sizes and different levels of performance. So that idea here is that you can take a if you have a lot of space you can stamp out a lot of little processors or you could stand by one bigger processor. Both of those are ways of taking it more transistors stamping out more little processors is probably better if you have a lot of threats because they're more power-efficient and if they have and if there's a lot of parallelism performance scales linearly, but if you don't have a lot of threads then building a bigger processor is probably better but building a process that is twice as large won't give you twice the performance.  So that's why we have the square root term. So he said that the area of the performance of the processor is the square root of the  area  Yeah, so basically scales with the length of the longest side if it's square of the length of the side so is it sort of looks at the different possibilities for the fast car in the small core so we have a total of 16 units of a 4 by 4 grid that we're going to fit into so the first case that you can have one fast score in 15 small Kors, which I think means that they will be the same he'll be 16 basically uniform cores in that case one fast car that took up for blocks and 12 small Kors or I can have a three-by-three fast score and seven small course, so be kind of one big chunk and then cover on the edge of the smaller course and so you can just go down there and if you calculate the speed up  What's the deal?  come and give you the  give you some.  application characteristics  Oh, okay continue from Q2 to calculate the speed of its really that are like dual optimization version of sandals LA, but there's nothing left over. So there's only two terms on the bottom and then you can calculate the speed up at a turns out that the middle option is the best.  Largest bass poor will be participating in the paralyzed. Oh  Yeah, I assume. Oh.  Darkforce a did you just pick that term.  Yeah.  Well, we're not cuz of the actual term is dark silicon. That's like what we call it in like research. So I'm taking a question. Yeah, so I guess  oh, let me make a note for the final.  Of course we date on the paralyzed. Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I mean, I think that's a reason given their the the given their conditions of the question. It's a little more complicated because really that's actually really good.  Depression just keeps getting better and better because if you do that, right, so one one way to think about this is that you should have more you should have one extra cord to speed everything up, but it's actually going to be a little bit faster.  But at the same time if you're running a bunch of stuff in parallel, you would have to wait for the slowest thing. So it's not going to pay off one of the challenges in modern Foster Design is that  So what's happened is that I used to be there's this really beautiful paper by the sky name Dennard back in.  probably  the sixties or seventies amazingly what he said is like if you build your transistors in a very certain way when Moore's Law increases density, but if you design your transistors in just the right way as they get smaller the amount of power they dissipate goes down as well. So that the power consumption for us a whole processor remained power consumption per unit area remain basically constant even as you scaled, which is great cuz you get exponentially increasing transistors, but constant power so your Energy Efficiency kind of went up exponentially, so Dennard scaling ended in like 2004 because we had some fundamental limits about how transistors work. And so what's happened is that the number of transistors kept growing but the power budget now attracts the number of transistors Soper transition flowers are constant, which means the / Core Power is increasing exponentially.  What are cooling capacity of Captain like a hundred Watts for die or something? So the consequence has been turned dark silicon. And so one way you do this like how do you spend transistors in such a way to make sure programs performance or Energy Efficiency better? Even though you can't turn them on all the time in the main answer is heterogeneity. So I can turn on you know, I can turn on my 7 small Kors or I can turn my one big fast score and they'll be better different parts of the program or I could coprocessor. So like if I have a graphics thing I got out or if I do a lot of factory stuff. I could have a graphics processor and graphics processor or the main core so that my max power consumption is still low, but I get the benefit of having this kind of heterogeneous.  bunch of computing resources  pictures of some of that. I like pioneering work on that stuff here at UCSD.  Back in 2007 and a torso.  more questions  almost done. Yes.  homework 7  Okay.  M488  All right. What is the question?  If this is a tlb does the disc also count as a page fault?  a tlb with disc  Kilby's never contain information about discs  so the page table contains information about discs.  So the page table is what stores the entire virtual memory amount for an application and it will include mappings from virtual addresses to physical memory addresses and it will also contain translation between virtual addresses and dislocations.  So that is where the disc stuff lives the tlb only contains memory mappings because basically because the disk is so slow, right? There's no point in cashing this thing because you're going to find out really quickly that you need to wait for like 11 milliseconds or something to go and get the date off the disc. So the tlb what does the cash for the translations only contains memory mappings?  Yes.  No, no.  I will cause a mess in the tlb.  And I will go to the page table Fusion to the 80 lb hamburger.  Which is a piece of software may be excited by some Hardware little walk the page table and we'll find that the there is there's no memory mapping for that virtual address and then the colonel will go and load that instead of a fight a disc address and then the colonel will go unload that disc address into memory and then it will update the page table so that I can match to that address where I put the contents from the disc and then it will update the TLD with the new translation to that address to the physical address.  my son's  So the mentirosa dimension by the same as for the final view, can I use a calculator? You do not get a cheat sheet. We will probably will if we need it what you probably will provide a copy of the green sheet from the  from the book for the nip stuff  You know, there are a few equations. You should know you should know what they are at this point.  It'll be 3 hours. It's roughly twice as long as the midterm may be a little bit shorter.  I am just as a reminder regrets. We're going to try to have a great at that night. We grades will be due by Sunday.  So that I have time to get them processed and get my grades in on Monday.  Yes.  Courtney C  I think the answer is.  So here's what I would do it. So the answer is not at the normal times because I have  To do another file another class tomorrow and then I'm traveling on Monday. I will hold some office hours at a different time tomorrow.  Trish I can tell you when in just a minute and then I will hold some office hours on.  Next Thursday right before the final.  but I'll be gone Monday through Wednesday, and I think the  As far as I know the tears are going to hold their office hours as usual.  any more questions  Yes.  That's a good idea. Yes, I will.  So tomorrow when office hours will be at.  11  All right. I sense a total lack of questions and I have but one bite of Sandwich left.  I will see you guys next Friday or sooner. If you cummed office hours best of luck with all your finals.  Thank you. "
