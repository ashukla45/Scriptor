  "Full Transcript": "So the compiler is in charge of taking the code that you write and translating it into something that machine can run and the key distinction for this class of everything about this wind is architecture independent. So I used the same compiler in the same programming languages in the same brain in the same fingers and so forth to write code really Carlos of which kind of processor and running that code on but then the compiler is sort of in charge of Bridging the Gap between that kind of architecture independent world and the architecture dependent World down here. We're actually concerned about the particular processor that we're going to run on. Actually the compiler is sort of split like this. There's a thing called a front end of this is the front and this is us back here is called the back end of the compiler. And I'll go through and talk a little bit about those the distinction between those two are the what's a compiler usually outfit is assembly language, which is very architecture specific. I thinking cc30 they're teaching you are now we're going to talk about nips in here. So you all different backgrounds for the compiler for generating notes code versus Arm code.  That runs through a piece of software called an assembler which takes that tax, which is still kind of human readable. Right? It's a little bit cryptic but it has letters and numbers in it and that generates machine code which is usually. O file if we're compiling C or C+ plus and then I could pass this takes multiple profiles and combines them into an executable and that's what actually runs and so this very is a little bit depending on which application or which which are language you're using if you're using Java what happens over here is you get a. I believe it's a bad class file, which is a binary format for the Java virtual machine, which is also architecture independent. And then so this goes like this and then when you run this biscuits run something through either an interpreter,  interpreter or and then eventually a jet which is a  jet just in time from headlights doesn't stand for compilers. She is not pesos is a jit compiler just-in-time compiler which actually happens while your program is running. So this is for a job over here a little bit different architectural a dependent park. There is a python interpreter that always runs your code and that was compiled of different architectures and that's how you kind of bridge that Gap.  if I have some  C code  So this is a cute little piece of Cinco discounts. The number of ones in the binary representation of I you can go through and reason to yourself that this actually would have does we're going to Loop this assumes that energy for you to bits and count the number of ones. And so the first thing is going to happen inside the compilers. This is going to get converted into a data structure, right? So this is text right humans are good at reading text with this doesn't actually it's hard to reason about this if you want to write a program, right? Like, how do you you know, how do you deal with this in a general way? This could be an all sorts of different can be formatted in lots of different ways of different indentation. I could have curly braces here and here or not. I could have given variable names that away and the the tool that uses to translate this into a data structure has something called an abstract syntax tree.  Tyler you'll see here, you know, this this program has a nice hierarchical structure, right? There's a function the function has some statements and one of those statements is a loop and the loop has some parts and then there's some stuff inside it. So that structure is represented here. Here's the function. It has some arguments. It has a body that has four or five different statements. It has two declarations and assignment  for Loop and return and the for Loop that has a bunch of pieces itself. So it has this brown part on this is the other color coded. So this brown part of this initial assignment / 0 2 J. This part is the test right here. The screen part is the increment part in this is the body this whole thing is the body over here and it's an f and the F has a test goes right there and then the F has the body which is this red stuff. And so it's no accident that you know, since we developed the first programming languages which were messier than modern programming languages. We should have learned how to make this transition very smooth. So if you go and take compilers, you'll learn about all the formulas arms around grammer's and you know, those context-free grammars and so forth. They have nice properties that are made make them easy for compilers to understand.  Ryan and sell it to this nice sort of co-design thing or the one hand we going to make the language nice and easy to use on the other we're going to make the compiler nice and elegant. So this is a architecture independent representation of your program and some languages. This is sort of like it's executed so you can think about execution is a traversal of this tree, right? So I'll do a kind of the first reversal the street outside of do what's to find that each one of these node and I could actually execute the program that way using something called an interpreter, which is a program that runs other programs, but we want to make us go fast. So we're going to  Massage some more so the next step we go from the upstair abstract syntax tree over something called a control flow graph. And this is the key thing about this is that it's more linear, right? So this is very to the Big Blob. It's a tree it's hard to think about, you know, you know if I want to lay this out of memory exactly clear how I do that control flow graph makes this much clear and the control flow graph is made up of things called basic blocks.  And a basic block is just a piece of code where the whole thing always executes together. So, you know, I always execute all this brown stuff and then, you know to paint what happens I might execute this whole thing of the screen thing but likes to eat all that and then we'll go to the purple chunk see the start of uninterrupted pieces of code are connected by the various transition that are possible between them so you can see right here. This is the loop right side down here. I have the increments and then there's the check at the bottom of the loop. I always go back up to the top and then I check whether or not my excellent condition is is true and if it is then I take  The exit out of the loop down to the bottom of trace the execution of the program through this control flow graph and you could execute this in an interpreter as well. And whether you wanted to use the abstract traffic is kind of a design decision, but they don't really say anything about the architecture is variables, but it does look more like instructions, right? So these are simple assignments and simple arithmetic operations. Then the next step is to convert this into assembly if I take my control flow graph and I linearize it. Alright those instructions down just basically as I'd run them over there on the left and then I add labels like here and here and here and then I have these jump instructions for branch construction. So here's a branch. Here's a branch.  And his other branch and those Implement these edges that move around inside my a control flow graph that I could actually run the assembly will take this in converted into some dips.  Oh and here's the high-level correlation between the two so you can see how the different colored coat color coded Parts over here map onto the map on to the various chunks of code over here.  Turn on the final step is to do it is to convert into binary and you get something it looks like this.  I was just totally unintelligible right now and can look at that and I know what's going on.  Acceptable processor. No trouble.  All right.  So the key thing here is that none of this is Magic. Right? Right. There's nothing, you know, particularly at least conceptually Difficult about getting from a programming language down to the because it's actually going to run on the machine.  All right.  Fisher  so today we are mostly going to talk about performance and metrics.  Right now we are down here.  right now we are down here in the  at least your sections, which is how can we meaningfully measure and compare computer performance and how to program characteristics affect performance.  You know when we design computers have a design processors, you know, we don't just started do what seems cool at the moment. We design things in response to data rice. This is data about how current applications perform on current processors and how we could improve them and Sonoran understand why we are going to make various changes to the processor and what kind of optimizations are going tonight. We need to be able to think about performance in some sort of rigorous way.  So the goals for this section.  All right, understanding distinguish between various computer metrics. So latency band with various kinds of efficiency and also to be able to think about composite metrics to understand and apply to see if you performance equation. This is very important to understand how applications and the compiler impact performance and understand and apply and those law.  Handel's La Jolla Circle many times  I promise you that I'll be at least one and probably more than one question that handles law on the midterm and Final.  And about the CPU performance equation.  so you don't do with that what you will  all right. So what do you want from a computer? You're going to go buy a computer?  What is a desirable characteristic of a computer that you might buy?  Yes.  So I'm going to I'm going to call that speed.  Yes.  low power  low-power. How about you?  Ram  so what do you mean by Ram? I want lots of Ram or a little Ram lots of RAM.  lots of RAM  what else? Yes.  small lips  What else? Yes.  15 in  I call that big.  lights  Wait, so used to be used to be able to buy 17-inch laptops. They were huge. They're awesome. Yes.  sheep  well  lots of storage  storage, Latta  what else? Yes.  reliable  111 Court I taught this class and the most common comments on my case was that my laptop sucked because it was crashing all the time. Yes.  GPU and CPU GPU and CPU  South Carolina fast graphics  draft picks  customizable  Sure.  prepare  lots of IO  What kind of audio options do you want?  I spent $400 on you USB C dongles when I got my USB C laptop. I still couldn't get my monitor to work.  All right.  anything else  Yes.  battery life  A hell yeah.  Mac  Book  Crow nest  what's the name of this is interesting. This is a 01 metric.  All right. It was a pretty good list.  Of course, there's trade-offs right? It's great right outside. So speed and low power.  Those are hard to have both of those small and big is obviously a challenge MacBook Pro.  and see if I definitely  definitely a problem.  And lots of yeah, this is a big. Yeah.  Yeah, this is also a problem.  I feel like this is a problem something else.  This isn't I recently was a problem.  But you know, there's one thing we didn't have which is this is this is actually like  enjoyable to use  I really hate windows. I can't tell you how much I hate windows. So this is actually a positive thing for me.  Pre-loaded with Linux. I see you on your computer not to work. I understand. I have a graduate student. He bought this awesome Razer laptop laptop you now and he comes to my research meeting Lou. Thank you.  This is one of Artie has Lou give little hands.  Thank you very very much. I appreciate it.  So he's and he's like I'm going to install Linux on my laptop and I'm like, oh no, so every time he comes to my meetings and I'm like you need to shower. Can you share what you've been working on his like my drivers don't work yet so I can  so now I can't show you that was like a six-week process if you have him getting his driver's working.  Okay, lots of options here.  Gagana something I wanted to ask him something. You want cool. I figured Justin Bieber is awesome and Lady Gaga a school that was three years ago about the trade-offs, right? So you can't have all of us some of these are easier to measure than others ride. So we have really good mattresses will see today for power efficiency speed just give me a variety of things are reliability, you know, some of these are just facts right? They're not really I guess they're kind of metrics but there are different kinds of speeds speed vs. Processor speed storage capacity is easy way to frame rate, right? There's application specific metrics. How many of you are gamers?  How many of you people used to be a lot proud or about their game or not? I like yes feel like I'm 120 frames per second.  That's a good metric. If you're into that like I don't care. I don't play games. I don't really care about the framerate. Oh, wow. They want to be quiet. That would be nice.  Extending extensive and ability. I guess that was a customizability cooling capacity fully functioning keyboard focusrite. So if you're going to make a decision when you're going to buy, you know, some of these are going to be 01 metris if you really want a MacBook Pro then you're going to get a Macbook Pros question of which one you want a question of how much you willing to pay for the bigger hard drive with a bigger SSD and so forth a lot of complicated trade-offs about all of them in reality. There's actually lots of these kind of binary metrics and you do a specific thing. We're talking about one's a little bit more continuous.  I'm easier to do math on.  What are some basic metric do people use quite a bit?  Or delay, I'm going to break into two classes. So there's lower is better Metro Center tire is better Metro or try some things. He wants to be high or something's going to be Lord has a lower is better metric, right I want this is how long it takes my programs or my computer to do something. I always would like my computer to do things faster as long as it's not like break or something. But as long as I'm doing something useful, I'd like it to go as quickly as possible and we measure distance seconds or time unit. So this can be seconds to microseconds or maybe clock Cycles, which is basically a unit of time is through point. This is a higher is better metric. This is how many things I can do for unit time. So maybe it's completed many tasks as possible per unit time. So if I am Google I might be stirring how many search queries I can do per second.  I also I'm probably also interested in how long each of those take so I want both high throughput and low latency if I'm Google cost lower is better.  I'd like to complete the task for as little money as possible is usually measured in dollars and so forth all you can think about this there are kind of fixed costs and there are unfixed Caso. The fixed cost is like how much does it cost for me to buy my computer? Right when I own it? And then the question is do you know how much does it cost me to run it? Right? So if I'm a cloud provider there's two things there one is is if I know if I want to use a cloud provider, I will pay them for access to that machine and the question is could they sell it to someone else for more money? And they also the cloud provider itself needs to pay for things like power right? What turns out to be very expensive and it would cost a big part of what it cost to actually run computers.  Turn bacon. Turn it off power. This is lower is better. I'd like to complete tasks while dissipating is 2 joules per second as possible.  But this is separate from energy which is just the total number of joules. I consume so power is really about all you can think of it as heat turn off. My computer is burning 50 watts of Houston dissipate 50 watts of heat and it's going to get hot but I pay for power from the electric company that we call it power. You're actually paying for energy because you paid for kilowatt times hours and this is joules per second * hours in this equals joules actually paying for unit of energy, which is something that you can use to do work and then walk to just how quickly you're consuming that energy.  The both of these are interesting for computer architecture, you know, this determines how much it's going to cost to run the machine to do a particular computation and power determines how much it's going to how quickly and how aggressive do I have to cool it? Because I have to somehow get rid of that. He otherwise my chip will melt we would like things to complete with low probability of failure. We measure this with saying things like mean time to failure which is how long on average something will run Until It Breaks.  So my meantime from such a failure for my laptop is probably about an hour, especially when I'm teaching. I don't know why but it seems to break a lot laptop.  Mostly works. Most of time hasn't outright failed. So it's mean time to failure was probably on the order of a few years. I'll pretty often and so this becomes much more critical if I have a whole lot of machines running together.  We'll take a look at one of these in detail. Don't think a latency. This is probably one of the two most important metrics were going to talk about in this class. So latency is related to speed. So speed is a bigger than much bigger is better metrically like things to be fast for them to be speedier. And we're going to find speed is just one over latency latency is also equal to run Time Performance is usually usually but not always means either latency or speed only talked about how fast a computer is usually were talking about how long it takes to do a particular task on this is important. It is for a particular task a CPU does not have a latency right? Just like your car does not have a speed right? It is capable of some speeds under different conditions on so likewise and see if he doesn't have a latency.  An application does have a license and a particular CPU. So if I run an application on particular computer, it will take some out of time and that is its latency.  What is latency matter? So latency matters really kind of person is waiting. We are very latency sensitive. I hate waiting right I click on Google continuous Lee actually Google spends a lot of time measuring how long infants geniously is. There's this threshold of our perception of time and it's somewhere on the order of 10 milliseconds. It takes longer than that you actually receive it is taking time. If it's fashion that it appears to be instantaneous and I'm waiting cuz this laptop is kind of slow and I tap again and then I get to copy the PowerPoint open which is not really helpful games of super important for latency sponsor. If I don't respond very quickly to my actions gets really hard when like I'm Doing Network games are to send some information over the network.  Get a response back. This is why I raised her in those folks will sell you really expensive Wi-Fi modems that are supposedly a little bit faster than normal Wi-Fi modems service Drive is just like Google. Can you just respect if you want things to be as quick as possible with tight timing constraints. So there should have two classes are hard real-time and soft real-time harder Alzheimer things like the anti-lock braking system on your car.  So you're into lock braking system is in charge of making sure that your wheels don't lock up if the road is slippery and you really want this to run at the frequency that was built to run. So this is called hard real time because if you don't make your deadline then bad things will happen like your car will Kareem off the road hard real time is really hard but still hard real time. So if you want to ride hard real-time software, you'll do things like no function calls. No memory allocation one function. You'll get rid of things called Cash's we're going to talk about anything that can change the rate at which your program executes are going to get rid of those very very reliable are relatively rare and Engineering things. Like this is really hard to give me the application. So if I'm decoding a movie, right, I would like I'm going to go it's a 30 frames-per-second. That means I have some deadline for decoding a particular frame if I missed the deadline because  I don't know if something goes wrong it take a badly time to interrupt or whatever. It's not a big deal. I'll be a little glitch in the playback but no one is going to get hurt real time.  All right, here is a clicker question. So latency matters more than bandwidth matters more than bandwidth while driving yourself to work and while driving a semi semi truck across country for a Facebook friend page. See you when doing homework with them when building a skyscraper, but not when building integrated circuits and none of the above.  I'll open boating. There we go.  I will take  are you going to discuss it among yourselves for a bit and then we'll vote again.  now I still don't know where to put my  I can't because if it goes off the edge I can no longer grab hold of it. So I cannot actually move it over there. Otherwise, I totally would.  I don't even know what that means. I like that then you can see the time.  You need a time, okay?  There's 14 seconds left.  543  210 all right. I'm going to close voting.  Oh.  All right, so disgusting ourselves, I will circulate out there and answer questions.  Turn to your neighbor.  And I'm just going to close this as soon as it seems like pretty much everyone has voted.  two three  I'm waiting for 6 more people.  All right.  Last Chance anyone else  3 2 1  so  All right.  seriously  Hurry up. All right. So are your original that look like and then you discussed?  I like you help yourselves because he is already answer. So why is he the right answer?  So looks like this is one of the times when you're driving yourself to work.  Do you care about latency?  Yes.  while driving a semi truck across country  Why don't you care about that, too?  a good question  man with Robert only one semi truck  Today is also a reasonable answer.  I'll make a little star here for me to edit that. So for next time be running very quickly and you are also like Facebook to load quickly. So you can hurry up and waste time. I hate having to hate having to wait to waste time. It's very annoying.  Is latency important also in your grading homework grading.  But not when taking an exam is latency important exam also, yes, right. I give you a deadline hard real-time. You must do computer architecture this fast.  Real get emergency last good grade when building a skyscraper.  This is a terrible question.  2015 dr. Swanson bad job  building a skyscraper, I guess. I mean, I think I do care how long it takes me to go to skyscraper. What about when building integrated circuits?  So this is actually I realized I I rearrange us the the lectures a little bit this actually depends on on something to talk about next week to take a long time takes a few weeks, but I got a lots and lots of them at once so I don't really care how long they take. I'm more interested in building. Lots of them efficiently same thing. If you ever heard it takes 5 days to make a Jelly Belly jelly bean right? No one wants to wait 5 days, but the key is that they make a whole lot of them at one time. And so that works out pretty well be an ABC and perhaps the Nazi Nazi. Definitely.  Actually, but not have a skyscraper.  Ratios of measurements to metric, right? And the reason that we might want to come by metrics is because we often care about want to compare two systems. So let's say that I have two processors A&B and I want to compare their performance, right? And so I want to know how much faster is a than me or what is the battery life of one laptop versus another so we're going to stay in this class.  Is that the following things are equivalent?  So if we have a metric that it increases by 2.5 * we're going to say that we can stay longer and I will say that if 2.5 times longer we could also said it'll increase by 150% right because when you do an increased by 150% so this is one.  Here's the thing. This is 2.5 x and the same thing is also a hundred and 50%  More right because with this one you sort of gets.  This is the 150%  let my sons but this is 2.5 times bigger and then we can also write this so right that vinu. So this would be old and this is new.  eye doctor  So sorry, I talked about 4 cents and ratios and so forth.  so  video  and these are also so if we say that we have old vs new and the old one is equal to the new the new one is equal to the old one divided by 2.5 x going to say decreased by 2.5 x decreased by 60%  So this is a little bit more confusing.  So here is how it says this is old.  And if I divide this by 2 and 1/2, it goes down to something like this.  New in this decrease is about a 60%  write about the ratio of  old to new  equals 2.5  We can also say that the symmetric increased by 4X because this is equal to say when I say.  I want to say that.  new equals  X  right  So this is a fractional increase o i x x original. So this means that the new line is 4 times the old one and I can so I can say it increases by this number the Plus or 1/4 bigger and bigger is better metrics to improve means increasing for smaller than smaller is better metrics improve the ins decrease so rude by 2.2 by 2x. Means latency decreased by 2x, which means it'll drop by 50%  questions about an examples  Like this one, so I just want to figure out which of these Rose has equivalent statements based on the rules that we are using for this class. So go ahead and click for those open up on your own and then we'll talk about it. And then I guess we'll talk about it in the world.  We will cook again.  So I keep in mind. This is a decrease.  So this is working at the decrease. This is a 1.2 x decrease.  couple more seconds  walk in your final answers  alright discuss  with your neighbors  You're not disgusting.  All right. What are you thinking?  All right.  So go ahead and vote again.  What's my reminder?  All right eye closing in just a couple seconds getting your votes.  Alright, so  and look how much of each other.  Corvette, all right, so the correct answer is d  Yay.  All right. Let's go out there and look at a couple of these Saudi is a AMD.  Look up there and look at a first.  1.2 x decrease  So that's this case right here. I'm at your decreased by 1.2 x.  Kumon writers up here. So he'll to be new so we can check that off that corresponds.  And that is a sword action of 16.6% So here is the equation for that.  FedEx percent decrease  if we look at decreased from BL to be new for the way to do this from scratch as we can compute the ratio of V.  new / V old  and we know what venue is so we can we can substitute Envy you can substitute in the old.  Divided by 1.2.  RV old  is cancel and we get 1 / 1.2 which equals?  5/6 that's true 5/6 which equals I'm out of space.  So five over six equals 834 I believe which is equivalent to a 6% decrease.  time for this first time check status  5.8 x decrease then what's 1 / 1.4? What's 1 / 0.8 so that equals?  Is it going to that?  So this is equivalent to the old / 0.08 and then you can go through the mouth into that comes out to an increase of 25%  Any questions about that?  All right. We're going to take a brief.  Break to do a little paperwork.  so  welcome back to the sower.  One of the things that we are doing I think I mentioned it.  What is this?  Oh my gosh, it's two pages long and Lou didn't staple them together.  How we going to do that?  Alright, so  we are so the survey did for assignment one will be another survey at the end of the quarter is some of the date of it's from that is going to go into some study that we're doing about basically how students like this class and how maybe we should change it so that he may eventually get published somewhere and whenever we do it like they do the makery published. You have the option to opt out of having your day to used in that publication. I'm so if you would like to opt out if you can come down at the end of class a little bit of extra time and grab one of these forms, you can fill it out and return it to me and we will make sure to exclude your data from that final study session about participating in the study. You can drop out of uni time and so forth. We guarantee not to sell your email addresses for money.  So these are appear if you have any questions you can come talk to me. The form is also online Link to in the first homework. So if you would like to do that, please do.  All right.  Alright, so another key metrics for this course has speed up. This is a good example of one of these ratios. So latency or speed up is just the old latency / the new Jordan see a spirit that is greater than 1 means the performance went up if it's less than what it meant performance goes down. If a machine a is 2 times faster than machine be then the latency of a equals the latest c a b / 2  Write the speed of is really important to talk about this alot. The speed of B relative to a is 1/2 x or 5X.  Speed up that other races in metrics allow the comparison of two systems without reference to an absolute unit. So if I take to speed up a movie about physics  What's a good physics don't have to take physics? No see have to take physics, but not CS.  Dimensional analysis really simple, right? So latency is it measured in seconds? If we divided seconds by seconds, we get Dimension list of Dimensions value right to speed up has no units. So this is nice because I can measure my time and seconds or hours or nanoseconds or whatever and speed up still works. And it's also more intuitive right? It's much easier to say that the program is latency was 1200 seconds and then doubling the clock rate would just 627 seconds, or I can just say the doubling the clock will give us a 2X speed makes a lot more sense and it's more intuitive enough to do math are these numbers can be really big and hard please ratios make it easy for us to think about those kinds of comparisons.  We can also drive better. Think about whether you're building a bigger is better or a smaller is better metric. So if you care about more than one thing right where that big list of requirements if I care about say band with $4, right, so if I were buying on network router, maybe I could spend a billion dollars and I can get a terabit router right? Let's maybe maybe a good idea maybe not so maybe I would like to find a good trade-off. So I'll take the ratio of bandwidth / money.  So this means that the bandwidth goes up then I'm at Circle get bigger. And if the cost goes out then my dad will give her my a metrical get smaller. And so this will allow me to trade off with a particular is that I'm willing to if I can double my bandwidth. I'm willing to pay double the money because that would make the demetric. Stay the same.  I could have been with for what same thing. I take my bandwidth metric and / my parametric I can do work for juul. This is how much work I'm doing for Jewel. I'm in general you want a Moto X bigger is better metrics in / smaller is much smaller is better metrics. So I have bad with going up. This is a bigger is better Metro or can I have a dollar is going down in the bottom / that because that's a smaller is better metric.  My cross have smaller is better metrics. So cycle per instruction going to talk about this one a lot. This is basically a Time unit / unit of work. What time for work time for work? So time is our this is a smaller is better metrics. So I put the the the thing I don't want on top. The smaller is better metric on top and I put the bigger is better metric on the bottom. I could I would like to do more work and I like to do it in less time. I can also multiply things together.  So enter latency X energy is called the energy the only product so it turns out that if you're willing to compute extremely slowly you can actually do it with zero energy just called adiabatic computer. You can actually do computer with you can actually compute things without expending in the energy which is an interesting and thought-provoking result, but you go really really slow. So this means if I want if I use energy to lay that means I want efficiency, but I'm not willing to give up too much latency not going to get up too much performance.  Energy later than interesting.  Example this is really important to offer things like mobile systems. So or I care a lot about latency because I want my phone to be responsive. But I also care a lot about battery life because I want to use it. And so I want to use a small amount of energy write your battery capacity is a man is a measure of energy. So this is really directly related to how much work I can do how many web pages I can browse and how quickly I can browse them given a given battery capacity.  And so you know that.  So we can think about how to reason through this. So if we have any pee for evaluating the title turn into finding designs are equally good if I reduce the battery life by 1/2 and reduce delay by 1/2.  Then I have Inu.  Oh, I do this is energy so.  my new system  uses  energy  babe  Teresa's battery life, right? So if I reduce battery life, right I use twice as much energy to do something. So that means that the new energy is twice the old energy, but at the same time the delay of the new thing is half of the way of the old thing then if I compute the energy to lay product those two things that have being equal so I would say that is a good trade-off right? I'd be equally If energy Dilley product is my unit, but I would be equally happy with those two systems right there the same metric or the other way around  I thought maybe I'm going to go if I go take twice as long but it my battery last twice as long that would be okay, or I could reduce delayed by 25% and increase energy consumption by 33%. Also have the same effect.  So what is the right metric right so there's not one universally correct metric, right? It depends on what I'm trying to do. You can use any metric you like to evaluate your computer. You just hopefully it makes sense for what you are when you're particularly interested in you could be interesting how long it takes to compile your code for GCC. That's like the be-all end-all. I bought machines like this for my research group because it takes a long time to compile stuff. So I have a couple of machines and our big rack of machine that are really really fast and they were really really expensive but they compiled  If I just want to play crisis then all I care about is a frames per second and if story right hundred, maybe I want to or maybe it's frames per second *  resolution  Right, cuz resolution is bigger bigger is better frames per second bigger is better. So if I can do lots of frames per second on a big screen, that would be really great. His Christ is still the right game to use or is there some other new worst game for graphics performance?  Crisis is still pretty bad.  Write what?  All right.  Database for transactions per second $4. This is actually a metric that's actually use commercially quite a bit. Right? I'm I'm a big are lion. I'm running a database that's going to you know, do you know I reservations and so forth. I want to do a bunch of transactions really fast and the most efficient way to do that is some crazy thing, right? So power x case volume / system wait times dollars, right? Because I wanted to be light and I guess  Big Ang's lot of power that will do that for me.  We're mostly going to focus on performance which is latency and or bandwidth in this class.  Cuz those are the ones that the processor has the most.  The most direct effect on example, right? So maybe want to go across the ocean or something. It should transmit data and a short time so smaller is better. It should transmit lots of data and it should transmit data a great distance. So bigger is better. So what is the right metric?  Bigger is better things go on top.  So I want what I want the one delay short time.  The less you go on the bottom cuz I want to lay to be small. I want lots of data.  Bike should go on top and I want to transmit a great distance. So I will put distance to this is like kilometers right on top.  this is  Variant land speed record the units here are terabit meters per seconds. So terabits is bits meters is kilometers or distance in seconds is on the bottom. So the world record a few years ago was 272400.  I don't really know what that means. I don't want to dig number and if I know that I care about these three things. I know they're making us number bigger is better. The latency here was 1800 seconds. This was transmitting about 600 gigabytes of data was 1.3 gigabytes per second in the start of highlights how that you. There's usually not just one metric. So the famous saying by got him Andrew Tenenbaum, he said never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tape on the highway, right so I can fill some sort of network is one way to get some data core somewhere. But another way is that I can just to know email some hard drives and Amazon will actually they have this very cool box. They will ship you. It's the coolest one of the coolest thing I've ever seen. So if you want to bring and bring, you know a hundred terabytes of data into Amazon Data Center,  Send you this box the gray box. It has a network port on one side so you can get data in and it's it's very rugged and it has an e ink display that automatically displays a shipping label for you. And so you load up your day that you push a button and it goes and talks to the cloud or something and download the new shipping label for UPS. You just stick it out and UPS will take this box of hard drives ship it to Amazon on Amazon will load it into the cloud for you because that's faster than never been done with this is quite expensive.  So here's a hard drive 3.5 inch hard drive holds 3 terabyte this really be like 13 terabytes. Now, they gotten a lot bigger station wagon.
