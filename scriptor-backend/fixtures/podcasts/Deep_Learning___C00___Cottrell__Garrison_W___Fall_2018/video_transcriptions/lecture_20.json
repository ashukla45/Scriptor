Prairie Vista  Let me share my screen.  monster ice cream  Yahoo  Okay.  screen within a window  Okay.  call  my answer my last letter. I like to talk about ethical issues.  bunch of the stuff  so  these are some of the issues that before I go.  Metron  let me see. Okay.  This is from the lecture that Jon kleinberg.  couple of weeks ago  Where are the missions that we should be worrying about us machine bias?  So there's this other than called.  Is used in a lot of courts in the US the job. What does Elder than  Say what's the risk of?  This defendant defendant.  So it's used actually used by judges in the United States.  weather  somebody up for bail  the station get out right now. We're putting them in jail until their court date, which can be  What's interesting about this is that?  This algorithm is biased against African-Americans. And so a lot of the things that we do we need to worry about the train.  Cancer woman  standard price recognition algorithms  Emarosa versus back  Best recognition algorithms so biased towards Caucasian.  This is one issue that we should worry about.  Another one that's not mentioned in my sides. I believe this FaceTime is called the  I thought about it in his.  Suppose I asked a robot to make me some coffee.  Korova can't make me coffee if it's turned off.  What are the things that I do is try to avoid being turned off and it started making you coffee.  That's called the office.  Russell and his student out of paper it it's kind of last year with a solution to the problem which way to having certain preferences.  If there wasn't a future life in which you're feeling off was a good thing.  that was a solution to the problem and  You know, it's a lot of lot of people say well if it starts to do something bad or just turn it off and unplug it if a guy is super intelligent, it would have already thought of that right? There's nothing.  Text weather tools are biased whether we can turn things like that, but that's not mainly what this talk is about.  Let's go back to my talk.  Samara Samara shoes most of the issues I talked about in this robot.  not machine learning systems are  Only as good as the train set sweet random on.  Be careful.  Another issue is her parents responsible.  What's an autonomous car?  robots  Suppose there are super smart as well.  And what what happens if they become much smarter than the singularity?  How are we going to get the fed them from taking over?  What if they decide that there is a superior race in beside to eliminate us?  Things that we need to be thinking about right now.  So there's a lot of good thing that are going to come for me. I may be able to perform.  We could have Smart Helen something that were working on.  Keep an eye on elderly people and allow them to be more independent.  self-driving cars could reduce congestion improve fuel efficiency and minimize Road accidents  Things like how reliable?  Does Aruba have to be before he trusted to do a human's job in right now?  I have to be really really sure it's going to be reliable and Romero all.  adversarial examples  having a self-driving car a little worried.  Stop sign.  So remember be worrying about how reliable are systems are examples.  What happens when something does go wrong?  Who's responsible?  What do you guys think?  your start car  who's responsible I'm asking you.  dumbest thing nobody  the company  Okay in the companies responsible.  The person who got it.  guys  the problem when serious answer so far.  tell nobody  it's not as serious and the logic is the same as being hit by lightning.  Maybe like Society for allowing our or the Tiger.  Yeah, well, so let's have a miscarriage will have tough decisions to make somebody work faster what happens when a star has a choice and apparently they're biased to hit black people.  It's kind of disturbing.  So what about the designer?  That person apparently didn't guarantee the results for a while. They're many people.  Or make you feel sicker instead of better.  What about the person who traded?  What about the owner in England in 1808?  The machines will be smart enough that will blame them.  There's no good answer.  philosophy  problem  the trolley problem  Call the trolley problem is the following.  This runaway trolley is rolling down the hill and you have access. It's about to run over 5 people tied to the tracks.  You have a lever that you can switch the trolley to go down a different track where there's only one person there. So if you pull the lever only one person will die, but if you don't 5 well  What would you do?  How many movie with Cobra Weber?  around 7  apparently  Too bad. You can't see my face right now.  Okay, so  aside from people in 190. Most people would say they would pull the lever.  Go to the next person is yoorana bridge over the tracks.  And there's a really fat man next to you and it's going to run over the five people. But if you push the fat man under the tracks.  Stop the trolley Matilda fat, man.  That's what I wouldn't push the fat man has been very different answers Brothers. Just playing around somebody.  And I will imagine that cars are going to have these kinds of issues. Sorry.  I think it's going to be really rare but you know that situations where either the car can drive into a  Call the person inside the car drive over somebody that's outside the car.  Answer some of the ethical issues.  Why do we need to worry about this now with the Advent of deep Networks?  What is creating machine intelligences?  alphago decides where to put stones on a board  today is Elsa building robots the variable to act in the world and smart cars are in sample of that.  And some people are actually building machines designed to kill people not accidentally.  You may have heard of this open letter from many people and they are calling for a ban on the development of autonomous weapons does depicted in The Terminator films.  the signatories include Stuart Russell Peter, norvig  other signatories include Stephen Hawking  Steve Wozniak Dan Dennett Noam Chomsky, for Donald Trump Vladimir Putin  Do you care in the US are both going ahead with plans to build a pound of Us weapons?  What are my responsibilities as Commander in Chief?  homes for now  so  Seven points from letter are the autonomous weapons select in engage targets without human intervention. They're not like where there's a pilot in the pilot is trying to decide whether to drop the bomb or not.  There are many aspects of  the prices are so smart, could become smart.  Does natural language processing gets better? They could interview you about your political beliefs before they decide to shoot you.  And you can text them and Nails cast themselves Before They Fall River those could become weapons as well.  are we going to have weaponized quadcopters and actually Isis says use these other than  People who do search and rescue go into a burning building to find people who are in that same technology could easily be used to destroy people.  Spencer Pizza Bowl, you know by the time  Established in your deep learning job of Google or whatever these things will be possible.  Actually the third Revolution Warfare after gunpowder nuclear.  My question is whether  And the endpoint of this technology is going to be the class because of tomorrow.  things to consider here is that they  require a lot of expensive technology. They're going to be very easy to mass produce.  They're going to end up on the black market.  access to them  airventure idea for assassination to face recognition  So this is probably not a good idea.  You know, I have a lot of benefits for society.  Starting a military arms race is a bad idea and we should ban defensive autonomous weapons behind meaningful human control the weather say, yeah, we should get rid of feelings or things like that for them to make a decision about things.  Are there people who think this is a good idea?  first of all, he says letters like this won't work I tend to agree with  And technology is not inherently good or bad. What we really need is a way of making our tournament sound robots aphid.  I like to take this statement and show in another phrase.  That makes it seem kind of ridiculous to me.  things that an autonomous weapon can do  first of all persons need to protect yourself as a human does  if soldiers go nuts and you know Keller Hall village, it would be there to save a document why we should have these things.  Find the DMV in between South Korea.  I think it's a Samsung and it's capable of shooting a human.  miles away  has an automatic mode  You know things that never happened Sunday. It's actually happening now, and we need to be thinking about that.  SMS  before I go on  do you say is that the good results of machine learning are sufficient to light continue with a i and they can overcome.  Okay, so what would Kanye?  What would convince you that the results are more in number than the badder than?  So, why are we continuing to teach machine learning systems?  Because machine learning has a lot of benefits for Humanity will be other jobs in right now.  They can do some things much better than us.  So then what day can be way more accurate than we are until making and still never get tired?  You can spend as long as you want with robot doctor and it will be pushing to get on to the next thing.  like a robot since controlling a nuclear plant could have prevented some of these for  in to mm  old enough to remember Three Mile Island human error  There's a lot of ways in which machine learning can be good for us.  China Wok  Did the u.s. Stop sneaking up on Wilson Road?  Significance of Beyonce's so it's better that we prepare for it like nobody's making autonomic on the US or not.  That's always the argument.  People that have weapons that don't have a human in the roof that's going to depression.  I just read a science fiction book recently in car by the same guy who wrote Ready Player one. If you saw that movie turns out that in this perfect come us.  population to pay Haley instead of RDA practice on the moon  play we have we know a lot about their weapons and they're training us through each video games to the  one of the features of this is that he gets killed.  We have between technology but without human.  Okay.  What about the singularity?  How many of you think that?  Be worried about this right now.  Rolls Royce  Yeah, almost all of them.  Almost everyone thinks.  What about what about a thousand years?  some of them 50%  What about a hundred?  around 10:15  Dollar Tree  best of you agree that it's just a matter of time. We need to start thinking about this now. I have them in my right and so we have to be very careful about what we want them to optimize.  Summit View of Mason.  This video game player that was optimizing how many points a day?  The system ready to just go around and pickles and shoot shoot other beds.  Because I would make ribs Prince go up.  We have to be very careful about what goals we give our assistants.  What's it called to the system will be because  figure out ways to  the system is  what is the weaponized?  Again, we have a ton of us. We're going to have a ton of its vehicles to have some now, they're not as good as they should be.  Especially weapons as we know from terrorist attacks in France and England.  Call Peoples Gas in the big truck and drive over the sidewalks.  These are weapons in.  So and they will be controlled by robots.  Churchland who as an Emeritus Professor UCSD  Sorceress running about in The Singularity is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.  I don't agree with that. I think it's closer than we think and we really should be worrying about it.  you know, so I mean  and  7 secondary consumer better than us. They can recognize so we really should be wearing.  Heating ham in line Like Us by a combination of reinforcement learning in the neural network.  Change that people play the game.  Amber better than Elsa  there's going to be able to handle better than going to be much faster than we are and their learning language.  You're going to be better than us and things like planning.  Forget things most likely.  Since I say by using reinforcement learning, they learn by trial-and-error and what they're wearing like the best going around in circles.  So you still have a lot of trouble saying how the Bernardo?  a lot of work right now, you know if we wanted to play these things so I can turn making decisions about  medical care about what drugs do give us things like that are transferred, but we have complete access to them.  that doesn't mean that we can't exactly figure out how they're doing what they're doing and what are the requirements we need to be thinking about is  This is the thing that you know many people concerned about.  things in the real world  we need to be able to have them explain to us how they got to their conclusions away the evidence things like that.  Ray Kurzweil one of the people is predicted the singularity.  George Manson said he's the smartest person he knows and predicting the future of AI.  and where has some ideas about how to say I could be used to enhance us, so we already have  Artificial snow clears people are working in artificial retinas.  Blind people being able to see if they have interfaces with other brands.  Eventually, it may be like in language.  Possibilities were good things happening.  So should we trust him?  In 1990. He produced a computer with DaVita World Chess Champion by 1998.  1997 RPM Speed Lube defeated the world chess champion  PCS would be capable of answering prayers by accessing information.  OK Google  by the early 2000s exoskeletal lives with nothing settled why and when people  replacement tags  springing  that makes it  on the Run  someone with just a biological  You know any predicted that people would be able to talk to their computer and give commands by 2009.  natural language interfaces like Siri and Google Now  text revenue's my thumbs.  I live a sabbatical in France in Dijon France into 2013 to 2014. I was tried and I couldn't understand what you saying his high school friends.  I handed her my my cell phone with Google translate. She talked she didn't transfer very well since I was able to understand what she was trying to tell me.  So, you know things are happening quickly. He said that computer eyeglasses brought by the 2009 virtual reality headsets that are just getting better and better.  By the late 2010. She said classes will be in images directly onto the retina.  Computer power will cost about $1,000.  By the 2020s most diseases will go where is Nanobots become smarter than current medical technology.  Normal human meeting can be replaced by Nana systems. That seems like a really bad idea.  Edison Pointe in the 2020s human drivers won't be allowed on highways because they'll be too dangerous.  Kirk me right about this  and then he says we've been 30 years will have the technology technological means to create superhuman intelligence in shortly. Thereafter has been Avenged.  Prediction is it by the 2040?  Non-biological intelligence will be a billion times more capable than biological intelligence. That is us.

Some of these things have crazy now.  You put a lot of stuff. That's crazy in 1990 and they came true.  introduction to transcend the limitations of our biological Fridays and brain in the intelligence that'll emerge the reference of human civilization and  will be human even if they are not biological.  Marvin Minsky you just started last year and MIT professor and one of the founders and there I said  What's the computers that control we might never get it back?  We would be we would survive if they're suffering Super Lucky. They might decide to keep us as pets.  So we have to think about preventing this now.  The reason I got interested in robots was from Reading Isaac Asimov.  What's it called?  Pulling over in his grave.  If you said the robot killing people.  Writing science fiction story about this is called iRobot and it's a series of short stories with wake me up some fast food was the deep into the kernel of the operating system would be these three laws.  The first one is that a robot may not injure a human being or through an action for our human being to come to harm.  the first one  the third one is the robot must protect its own existence.  What day is operating system it would sacrifice itself to save a lots?  send the robots robots may not around Humanity to come to harm to an action allowed to come to harm and they sell fly off to another planet where they set up their own robot civilizations where they  Have concerts where the music goes really really fast.  Winchester start eating robots  how to reject words from humans so, you know we have to worry about.  So then some of these issues.  Wright's Riverside Google doing work for  Promoting one particular store on these questions obviously have an opinion about this.  read comments  How much is one person to be thinking about this? It feels like nobody else. I need one person messes up and like if there's a terrible AI.  How do you how do we know what's happening?  I don't know. How did how do you say pause while because he's asking how do we stay positive about this all just like even if we all agreed that we were using one last somewhere like messes up a I destroyed everything. So what could we do about it?  researcher in his garage like  Lake Stevens and creating Apple  I think that's unlikely that anybody is going to lose just by themselves.  That's certainly a possibility.  boyfriend sex right  Yeah, 1 location.  So I know there are like encouragement to instead of Miles Davis Elementary versus then it's kind of slow.  Will be like today.  Okay, so I hit solution. Is that like instead of going with them?  Where is thinking is going to happen?  What's the where we go?  Okay, so  it's time for a movie. Are you guys like to watch movies? I couldn't find.  The whole episode I like to play a little bit.  Usual 26 minutes of it. I don't know. I think I only found three minute videos this time, babe.  The measurements are very famous episode.  Can I have the Doritos mandroid who is?  Dr.sun service guy from the robotics Institute shows up on the Enterprise and he's put in a transfer in order to come to his lab because what he wants to do is take me to a party.  so they can figure out how it works because  unique in the universe created unless you have the right to choose and Riker who's kind of the Captain Kirk Star Trek the prosecution is it where I am?  Until there's this.  Does Picard makes at the end of the the trial?  I want to apologize in advance for the the roboticist in this is a terrible actor.  That's the matter go down the right. This is Picard on the left.  If your voice and some of the universe in a black hole for the last 10 years and you won't recognize them.  Sound is not coming through.  Okay. I just I just turned my phone. Maybe that will help.  Where can I find?  Okay, so like either you could send me the link and I'll play here at my laptop if it's not working.  Okay.  horoscope  You're probably have to watch it.  Commercial before you get to watch it.  What is required for?  my personal property  oversee this hearing impaired  Society decides that has the right to choose and  since I've been formally request for Emily refuses to undergo and then and then  I heard you guys to actually go and watch that all episode. It's very good. I hope you've enjoyed the class and I will see you again on Tuesday night at 9 at 7 is next Friday at 7 and its in this room.  Hope you enjoyed the class.  Okay. "
