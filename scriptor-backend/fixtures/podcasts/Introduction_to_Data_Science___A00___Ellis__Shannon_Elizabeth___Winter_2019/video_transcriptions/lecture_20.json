    "Full Transcript": "Play Welcome to the last day of cos 9 more cookies up here. Feel free to get up at any point during this and have a cookie and whatever's left up and come up and get it and take it. I feel like it's probably a stressful time for a lot of you and luckily for you all when I'm busy. I spend a lot of time baking which is counterintuitive. So I spent an unusual amount of time baking this past weekend and you all get to eat it so that it's not sitting in our house, which is only two of us. So feel free to come down.  And just like we normally start will start with the reminder is your final project is due Thursday. I did send out a Piazza announcement for the survey for the end. It's really helpful, especially for those who have already participated in the other surveys for me to get a full picture on so everybody who has time. I know it's busy if you have a few minutes, it's super super helpful and it's an extra helpful cuz I went through read responses today and somebody pointed out that I had mistakenly not put the background example on the finals laboratory notebook up to like that one rock usually one of your teeth have been doing all of the examples and I think he did a stellar job. And of course then I dropped the ball on this was so do you all ready to copy the background isn't in there if you make a copy of now it's a example is in there for the background for your final project. So feel free to go back to the link if you already made a copy. I'm so super fish ate all the responses so far. I'll leave it open for a week or two.  I'm coming out. I would love to have a super high response rate.  All right, so we covered a bunch in his course of the last lecture is just about the future of data science over to talk about the field as it currently is what you all have accomplished and then what the future holds for data science in a few of the things that are going on that'll happen in the future most likely so we're just going to start with where are we now I'm going to be showing you a bunch of data from a report that has been going on since 2015 and it was initially by a company called crowdflower. If you see these like dark background pictures those the ones from the 2017 report they change their static a bit for the 2018 and they're no longer name crowdflower the date and I'll come from Figure 8. It's just a rebranding.  And when you think of all the things we talked about the score so far whether or not these are good visualisations and think about the date of that they're showing so here we have 2015 and 2017 and what they're showing is at 25% and 35% of the data scientist that they surveyed in their report. I've been in a row for less than 2 years which suggests that people are either neither roll or new data science completely. So there a lot of people entering the field. It is a new field. I'm going to point out that there are a lot of people that are new to their jobs just like you all will be the first time you enter into the field.  And the reason that these data are collected and that people talk about data science as the sexiest job of the 21st century after the fact that you were here. So this is a second or third year in a row data science has been rated as the number and the reason isn't just that people make a lot of money which the salary starting as a median salary is pretty high. It's also because there are a lot of job openings. There's a lot of opportunity. It can't be the best job if nobody can get the job and also people need jobs tend to be happy over all that is our data from Glassdoor.  I think is particularly important and helpful is the fact that people who are data scientists tend to be happy or very happy and that's increasing over time. So this is the report from 2018 to this is the most recent report from data scientist. And we're seeing this upward Trend when was 90% of the people who respond to a survey who are data scientists said that they are happy or very happy in their role as a what is encouraging to me. I don't really care if a ton of people make a ton of money if they're miserable, so it's great that they're making a good living and that they're generally happy.  Another point is that people who are currently employed in the data science field are constantly getting recruited to other job. So more than 90% are almost 90% of the data are recruited are called at least once a month with some people getting contacted several times a week with that being actually the most common. So if you're in the field and you're currently are in high demand, if you're already in the field, it's more difficult as Sean talked about on Tuesday to maybe break into the field. So there's projects and approaches as he talked about to get into the field. But once you're in there you're on highly valuable at this point.  And this is something other than glass door that we talked about a bit. So these are the skills listed in the job postings for data science. The top three won't come as much surprised you to 72% of the job postings are looking for somebody or never mention the word of python, but only a few percentage last mention the word or the skill r-and-r 51% mentioned that they when he doesn't speak with. I would gather and this is just a guess that you expect to be accepted and nosql or become familiar with it. Once you're in the position. They didn't put it in the posting another number of other technologies that have to do with either scaling or statistical analysis or data visualization.  So I mentioned that data scientist are in their positions. There are lots of positions those that are there are happy. But what is it that makes him happy so they looked at what takes up the time and was the Day's Night is so this is from the report from two years ago. And I mentioned they had some interesting visualization. So here they have a stopwatch and then their pie chart is in the middle of their time and a show that and this is something that we talked about that 51% of our time is spent collecting labeling cleaning and organizing data and they spend less time actually answering their questions of interest and made a percent is other I was just here that if they included in meetings and Communications, like for the presentation this whole pie chart would look a little different and that's just not one of the things included so often as page talked about in her guest lecture, you're talking to stakeholders you're talking to your higher-ups you're talking to marketing you're trying to explain your analyses that you've done to others.  So maybe the most eccentric visualization I'll show you. This one here doesn't really apply to the data described to the date of the new principal cuz there's a lot of Ink on here that doesn't really show you any information. So what they asked in the survey was the three tasks you enjoy the most versus the three that you enjoyed the least and then you can see those along the bottom. So we have this collecting data sets cleaning organizing. So you're doing and getting your data over here and then you have your modeling data and asking questions and here with this rainbow bar with these unicorns on top. These are the ones that data scientist said they enjoyed the most I want to see the skeleton over here. These are enjoyed the least.  And this is a common theme with in data science is that people like getting the answers and like having to do the work to get the answers a little less? I'm going to get Frozen ride from trying to I'm going to work on me anymore. Just the next time to say that this this doesn't have to be as boring as you make it out to be if you are set out to understand your data that more than anybody else in the world and to find things that could be wrong. I think of it as a puzzle. It can be a lot more fun than we make it.  So aside from what people spend their time on what makes them most exciting want to talk a little bit about the types of data that data scientists tend to work with this is from the 2017 report where they asked at does a significant amount of your work involve unstructured data service bars or unstructured data cities your images your text your videos whereas structure David down here. So he's your spreadsheets. Most of the time people said that I was about half and half where a significant amount of your work is all done structured data about half spent most of their time with structured data, which is what we focus on most of the time and its course.  That's the question a little differently in the most recent report. And their question was do you work primarily with structured or unstructured data? When I acted this way primarily people said that they work with structured data for the type of data we can talk about in this course. What is 30% work with unstructured data?  When I've been looking at what types of unstructured data people work with the most most frequently. It was texting. So we spent a day talking about text analysis on but we didn't talk a ton about images or censored a audio or video censored. It is becoming more popular. We have wearables you a Fitbit Apple watches and people are sending out sensors to gather data from individuals all the time. I'm so there lots of unstructured data the data scientists tend to work with  This is also just a bit about how do scientists in the field get their data most companies have system setup where they collect data from their users internally or they generated from internal systems based on how you interact with the system, but do it people do collect their own data sets and use publicly available data and sometimes companies will have data scientist to work with the data that another company has collected that's outsourced collection.  All right. So Sean Fat Tuesday talking about how to get a job in data science. And he said that there are different paths but there's the tried-and-true where you get the internship. There's a hustler where you're doing projects and getting the experience based on the products and the work that you've done on your own and I both of these can be successful and he mentioned Vicky boy gets at the end of his talked and shared a link in the slides to this blog post and Herb Thai Dover Broncos is that data science is different now, so she's been in the field for a while and she is particularly concerned about the fact that there is an oversupply of Junior data scientist. So before there was no data science major anywhere and now there is a lot of you are involved in it and it's also been discontinued media hype of data science. So people know what day does eyes is now or excited. I don't know that it pays well and know that it's a good job. And so she wrote a whole block both and it's a long while posting. It's a good blog post. I don't agree with everything that you said, so I think she makes some good points and she said that there's a ton of Junior Talent on the market.  And so when she used to see 20 applications for a job, she's now seeing a hundred and she's heard of people getting even 500 resumes for single opening. So there's a lot of people find a job in this gets back to where Sean said it's not personal there. A lot of people interested in this position. There are a lot of these additions, but you may not get one at that you need to qualify for it because somebody else might be equally qualified for it. So her blog post goes through and says that may be getting a degree in data science isn't the right route and suggest that you should maybe think of something else and I think that assumes that getting a major in data science only allows you to get a job as a data scientist and I think that if you have experience working with data and the skills to work with data, you probably have the ability to work in science Rules as well as many other roles and I think that's something she didn't consider in her blog post, but she does go through and explain why it's different now and it's harder and she's afraid that people are going to get jobs that they're expecting to get but she says that like, it's still a great job. She still loves it feel  Welcoming and so she offers advice at the end of this largely Echoes what Sean said on Tuesday that if you learn SQL and learn programming language and how it works really really well, if you're familiar with how to work in the cloud like things with working with Amazon web services that you are able to be successful and lots of people are still successful. So I didn't want to make it this job is super excited. You're going to make a ton of money and it's going to be really really easy without discussing the fact that it is getting harder but there are still tons of. And the last thing I want to mention up here is that Vicki put this in her blog post and I think it's a really important note that this is hard for everyone and if you're struggling and stuff theme typical know that it's probably difficult for everybody and you're going to have ROBLOX and things some projects aren't going to pan out or they're going to hit a roadblock and you're not going to know how to solve it and that's okay. So don't get discouraged keep trying if you're interested in it and passionate about it. It might take some extra effort but likely will work out if you have the skills.  Okay, and this is a GFI showed before in the programming lecture and it's one of my favorite ideas of the bottom is that hard things are hard and it is only my postdoc advisor said to me all the time. It's like if you're doing something worthwhile and that it's difficult. It's going to be hard and it's going to be worth it at the end. But there's going to be challenged in the middle. So if you're doing super exciting stuff, it's cutting-edge a new it's going to be more difficult than stop that has already been done to remind everybody about that any questions about the current state of the field getting into data science jobs at John talked about  Ever heard of the role of data designer. Yeah, so actually took out a slide about the different like types of data science jobs in the roles in the skull that would need in there. What have you heard about that has designers  Yes, it is. Yes a day designer idea there is that as for not getting the data and telling the narrative to like form your question a little bit better is that so that's what I've heard of data is a designer's to as helping to guide to the project and also designing the way there would be communicated. There's also data Engineers typically have had more to CS background to be over Computer Science Background. These are people that are working on the system that allow the data to be used by the analyst or the data scientist. Are there a lot of different like diversifying rolls are having a data science. So their user may be accompanied D1 data scientist and they kind of had to be a generalist. I know how to do all the things but maybe not know how to do all of them super super well and now I've companies are diversifying where they'll have a data engineer who knows the system The Hobbit data scientist, who does the analysis and asked the question and then we'll maybe have a data journalist or somebody who  Communicated out to other people. So companies are taking different models as to whether or not they're spreading it out or they're getting teams together with different skills. So that is all happening and I'm curious to see like what models go forward and I think from what we're saying that different companies are going to continue to use different model and just going to be dependent on the company. There's some that data frames podcast that I showed once there's an episode with somebody from from the head data scientist from I Robot vacuums that go around and I'm clean up your house. Her name is escaping me. It'll come to me. So she if you look up date your friend and I Robot she talks about the ways that she's managed data science teams and how that change over time and what models she has found has worked. Why can't I think of her name?  Come back to me any other questions about jobs and data science.  Show me to take a quick journey through what you all have done. And what's going on here at UC San Diego. We talked about the field. Let's talk about what's going on here. But am I science major is still new lots of you are in it and there's been a lot of changes that are going on within the major trying to get soon as funding so they can pursue these projects are they have the portfolio going on there scholarships for undergrads to work with faculty and they're trying to make sure that students have money to go to workshops are conferences or to bring a guest speaker so that they get experience to a wide array of different people with any Institute. They're working really hard to find people with very background. So data visualization machine learning software Engineers to make sure that they have all of these varied experiences in the same place that you were students can talk with them and also looking and considering hiring a data journalist. This is something we haven't talked about a time newsrooms across the country are hiring people with data science experience to work with data and incorporate data into their stories.  Fivethirtyeight what kind of the pioneering this and I shown some examples from 5:38, but I know in Baltimore there is a data journalist and that is a pretty small newspaper and really they're being hired across the country to know journalism and to know how to work with data and how to visualize it for the general public and also working on getting office space for data scientists and their work exchange program or maybe a data scientist would work at a journalist and the journalist would come work here and we would start to get more understanding of how data science journalism Works cuz we don't currently have anybody with that expertise.  That's what you say here in this last you all have gone through in the beginning we talk. Just how do you ask questions? What is an ethical question? How do we approach ethics and privacy it within a data science projects. We talked about reproducibility and breakfast with ability and how to manage files after that. We started touching on programming. We didn't talk in detail about programming in this course, but we did talk about how the data would look at it. Is that where you would get that from and how to Wrangle it be then spent for lectures talking about data visualization how to describe your data and how to explore and then we spent the last couple lectures talk about how to analyze it. So we talked about statistical inference and machine learning for prediction. We talked about algorithms and gave examples of a few and it be limitations to our we talked about text analysis and geospatial Analysis and there we had to guest lecture so paid featuring any came and she talked about the work she did on recurring donors from her work.  Classy, we're trying to figure out how to help their nonprofits that they work with encourage people to become a grinder and donors because they figured out every card donors give them lots more money over time from Sean on Tuesday your ta he talked about getting a job in data science and what that takes and what it could look like.  Okay, so I wanted to thank Tas so that Jason is not here today. So Sean just so you all know that like what goes into making sure the exam for copy that we had a Scantron that would work and I would get everybody up grades done quickly and efficiently Rahul. I was behind putting a lot of the examples as I mentioned earlier into your assignments. Everybody did immigrating and Zane Will and Jada they also help run section and degrading way loon with one who generated the work books that were used infection by a few of you so every helps guy get this course going and I wanted even though they're not here to give them all around the falls and you all Round of Applause for your appreciation.  So they cannot hear that on the podcast cuz I know that a lot of them to listen to the podcast cuz they give me questions and feedback from it, which is also very helpful through the eighties and determine which of these explains your understanding of data science before and now again frequency code is a d and no answer here is wrong all of them are valid.  Trevor a few more seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so we have a lot of people saying that they knew designs was before but had a better understanding now and I didn't really know before and have a better understanding but as an instructor like I clearly would like understanding to increase but I don't think it is. There's anything wrong with the fact that it maybe you don't understand it as well as you thought or maybe I didn't do a great job explaining what it is to either of those would be possible. We're done here if your understanding change that's also told if I maybe you had a really great understanding of what they to science was and you still do it. So I have another one.  about  your interest in becoming a data scientist. So again, all of these are valid.  I might have follow-up questions depending upon how people answer and you don't have to answer if I'm just curious.  Go to a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so we've lots of people interested either equally or more those Rd NE some people in see who are interested in something else which is totally valid and don't feel that what they learn to help them and that's great to the people I'm curious to hear about are those who didn't want to be there to sign it still the one of your data scientist and I'm curious to know what you want to be and how you think cause and I could help you so if anybody wants to share that I would love to hear about it you don't have to  I really want to understand what data is everybody.  Okay, so you left, systems and really want understand how data what it what they are and how it interfaces with that. I don't be scared of it. Yeah, cuz there's a lot of data out there and I can be intimidating. Do you know how you what you would want to use this in so you don't have to  And you don't need to say talking about data visualization at 2 p.m. So I can give you more information about that if anyone anybody else, so if you look that up, and he's interviewing with hdsi.  And I want to figure out how to click boom boom like that. I'm just like so much of the borders between understand the truth. The truth is something where we used to share.  But they're interested in doing how cuz I would help them totally fair.  So we talked about that people are data scientist that they make a living that they enjoy it that they're working with tons of different data that they're answering interesting questions. And that's what they like most talked about. What we did in this park that we work through what a data science project would look like talk about the ethical implications talk about where you get the data and how to answer the question answer the question now is where we going  What is a data from the report the two years ago? And this was a question about self-driving car? So, when do you think you'll ride in your first self-driving car and most people said within the next 5 to 10 years, they will have ridden in a first self-driving car already had but that was not the majority. So this is clearly a topic that is up and coming there's a lot going on in the field of self-driving car and I wanted to show a few short videos today. So will this person will be about the minute?  Call it the current generation of driverless car is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for Schumer's they're trying to learn traffic rules, which is bright to be simple and coping with human unpredictability, which is more challenging.  Which would happen when whole cities become driverless? What do we need traffic lights would we need links? How about speed limits? They never stop at red lights in the first driverless cities. You would have no red lights and no lines and when all the cars are driverless and connected everything is predictable and reaction time minimum. They can drive much faster and can take an irrational initiative that can speed them up all the cars around them.  So instead of rigid traffic rules will be regulated by a massive Dynamic and constantly improving algorithms.  The result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth trigger of German Autobahn and the creative Vitality of the intersections of Mumbai.  What is the function of the exuberant it would be liquid like our blue?  Okay, so I think he might be a little idealistic in this happening and eventually we'll get there so they didn't you're interested Tacos on to talk about how we could model this like blood in our veins and it's an interesting talk, but don't remember the example. I talk about the elevator.  Saitek on elevator where you push the button before you get to it and when you get in there, no button for you. It tells you which one to get in and people freaked out when he first started that they didn't know how to handle it here. We're going to give up all control and we know that humans like control over talking about driverless cars driverless cars. In fact, so we know all the data show that driving is way more dangerous than flying butts. Lying is a way more common fear then driving people get in cars all the time. We know that's more dangerous than flying, but people are really nervous about flying.  I thought here.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I thought about including that today. So I didn't talk about to the following. There's a lot going on with Boeing right now and have been grounded in flights are being stopped all around the world because of automation. If you are in the field of flight, you should work slowly and carefully and not try and push forward to the times we can push board quickly and try out for them that as long as I'm packing light. So yeah, that is a straight line can be dangerous driving is still more dangerous despite what's going on currently and it is when you're flying you're giving up control self-driving cars require the same thing too late. So don't just like assumed that everybody can be fine going to driverless cars does it take another fact that we are using humans here and humans don't aren't comfortable when they lose control of things that they once had before.  So I think this point on this display, which is confusing but I'll walk through it. So they asked data scientist in green and they asked ethics professionals the same question. Would you rather drive yourself or use an autonomous vehicle data scientist? 75% of them said they would rather use autonomous vehicle but seventy-five 5% that same amount stead of the other direction that they would rather drive himself. So I think it's afford to keep in mind. I like when you were in a data roll and you're talking to a bunch of data scientist that you're likely not getting a representative idea of how the rest of the population is. You might feel your way more comfort with automation or self-driving cars and maybe the general population and you have to keep that in the back of your mind when you're thinking about these technologies that you're super comfortable with but knowing that other people would be less comfortable with them.  Okay, so tell Jaime cars are clearly an important discussion that's going on right now. The technology is there were moving forward with it. And I wanted Revenge switch and talk a little bit about how we talked about them on but I want to know how they're fragile and they're not always human like this is a scientific paper that fill a protector to predict images and protect images what the label should you apply to it so over here we can see that with these were all with 99.6% certainty uncertainty predicted based on their neural net. This was a starfish. This is a baseball and it's an electrical guitar and are human brains looking at this day. Okay, I can see how you might think. This is a baseball that it's clearly not a baseball. This is not a remote control, but we can see why the model may have thought that so we haven't built our own jet that are able to think and see exactly the same way humans would so they're super powerful and they can do really interesting things. But if we just make small talk,  Accident we can have their certainty obviously not reflect with actually going on.  So fragile, they're not always as smart as we want them to be and I always doing exactly what we think they're doing if we don't understand how they're working and wide is mistakes are happening which we often can't we're not to be able to move forward to really have everything reflect what humans see and images. This is an example of a case where this happened. So this was a few years ago what album is trading in this course, but algorithmic trading is when computers and trade on the stock exchange and we train is out how to do it around where the trading half ton of a real estate hasn't bought up around after that. The people who servers are closest to the trading happens milliseconds faster than people that are 10 to 20 blocks away.  So he's like you were working on a millisecond scale here where it is advantageous for you to be able to trade milliseconds faster than somebody at ten blocks away. So they like taking huge buildings in your city and then gotten rid of everything in, just put their servers in there so that they can do their trading milliseconds faster than the people walked away. And when you're doing is trading what happened on this day was that there was this huge drop in the prices of the stocks and to this day. We don't know why this happened the reason that it didn't continue on it because the computers did have a check on this and undetected sharp decrease and then stopped everything and then saw that they had recalibrated and were able to open it things back up. So they didn't have that stuff in there. If they hadn't this before whatever reason we don't know why the computer decided to allow this mini crash to happen, but it's not because the computer detected it, but if you're not keeping you don't have that. This could become disastrous and we wouldn't on  Why decisions have been made we would know exactly what drove is cuz we can't even have his that determine why this happened?  Okay, so I ruined our fragile sometimes I make mistakes if they don't really understand how they're making their decisions and they can't explain to us how they're making their decisions. They can lead to think that we don't understand but elbow are powerful. So I wanted to talk about on human bass competition has already seen a recaptcha before. Yeah. Okay. We're going to talk about them a little bit too short clips from his talk so we can chat about patches and Recaps has  Is a few minutes.  I would one of the people at least not visually impaired human writing a program that can buy Millions tickets to at a time Yahoo, registration page random characters that happened to be shown to the use of word. Wait, which of course spell a word about the best part is the message that the apple cup this got about 20 minutes later.  a person thought menu  Which is something that we started then we send it into a startup company and then about a year-and-a-half ago Google actually the choir this company. So let me tell you what this realization.  Baby * 200500000 hours every day fighting is annoying caption.  And then I started thinking those 10 seconds. Your brain is doing something amazing. Your brain is doing something like having a caption. Not only are you getting yourself as a human but in addition you're actually helping us to digitize books. They so let me explain how this works.  And then you scan a photograph of every page of the book journey to be able to decipher all of the words in this image. That's when using a technology called OCR optical character recognition, which takes a picture of text and try to figure out what the text is in there. Not the problem is an OCR is not perfect specially for older books where the ink has faded and the potatoes have turned yellow OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words to I was worth taking all the words of the computer cannot recognize people to read them for us while you're typing a caption on the internet. What is the next time you actually work that are coming from books that are being digitized for the computer going to recognize. The reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because you see one of the words  I'm going to send it to you. But since it doesn't know the answer for it cannot graded for you. So what we do is we give you another word for hyper correct word for the one and get one more word, which type accurately so this is how the system works.  Okay. So what are you doing a little bit more about this and why I pretended to use I wanted you all to understand how captcha and recapture Works generally and what you're all doing with it in the back.  Question was when you have images rather than words. And you have likes is at the stop sign is this a car and a person is is that for self-driving cars? I don't know the answer to it fully. My assumption is always been that is for that or for just general image recognition. So it could be used for that could also be am going to get to face recognition in a little bit other technology, but it's certainly not just being used for that one purpose anymore. But now it's being used for research, but I don't know for sure.  okay and recapture are and I just wanted to  got another minute.  My favorite number of recaptcha the favorite thing that I like about this whole project at least one word out of a book cover 10% of the world's population has helped us digitizer human knowledge and it is really big things that you might have gotten together and pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the moon. They were all done with about the same number of people. We're all done with about a hundred thousand people. And the reason for that is because before the internet more than a hundred thousand people  Actually possible to get more than a hundred thousand people to work on a single project before we just saw that he has 750 style that people working on digitizing books. And so it doesn't matter is that when you had day that you can collect from the internet you have the ability to help and solve problems are a lot bigger than we've ever been able to do previously. So I think the future is more and more of these large-scale experiments. And of course, there's a lot of excitement around that but as a theme of everything I talk about this course is also a potential for danger.  So turn around and talk about self-driving cars. There are a lot of data out there and they could give you misleading claims. So this is an example of a paper that was written about Facebook data. And the title of the paper is private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior. And they know that using information on people's Facebook profiles. They can predict whether they can predict High Intelligence from things like thunderstorms The Colbert Report science and curly fries. Where is low intelligence is indicated by Sephora. I love being a mom Harley-Davidson and Lady Antebellum.  What others do stay there is no obvious connection between curly fries and high intelligence. So I take all of this with a grain of salt because we're not really understanding anything intuitively about intelligence when were correlating things like this. And in fact, we might just be reinforcing stereotypes that have little to do with anything. So I came out some of these things reliably has been allowed to put back into the how accurate this was but there's a lot of data on Facebook and it can be used for a cool things interesting things or slightly silly things like thing that people who like curly fries are highly intelligent.  But using things that people try to do from these data that we have on hundreds of thousands and millions of people but I want to talk about some technologies that were like sci-fi when I was a child that are now realistic. So the first one is a short video  ideas for a translator  American Girl  the singer  Kentucky  Okay.  I am in French.  But this is awesome. But how you doing translation technology to allow people to speak different languages, but still clearly understand each other. It's the dream, you know, I like on Saturday. We have language barriers anymore.  Okay. So this video is more marketing then showing you anything like technical that's going on here and it's cool that to people that didn't want to go to communicate before can't communicate with the applications of this or white bread dough in my homework. I generated a online course for people to learn data science with no background of magic computer. I put the top of the world for free but someone English and there are a lot of people in the world who don't speak English and so we're using technology like this to translate Oliver videos translate all of our texts and to make sure this can be used by more than just their self and it won't be perfect translation technology is good, but it's not great. We might need to have people go in and check it after is it a large majority of the work could be done and certainly work that we wouldn't have been able to do as a team. So this type of technology is being used in education and in the government so that people from different countries can communicate so it's super cool stuff and I used to just be an idea in sci-fi.  I'm here to another idea of stuff that happens in has been sci-fi fiction for a while.  Working on his reflection and refraction.  Jim Henson  tomato 75\u00b0 Mount Vernon Place.  What I said this is been in TV shows forever that they able to do crazy things with images that weren't actually possible at the time, but now you all probably know who these two images are cuz they're two very famous images. We have Abraham Lincoln on the left and the Mona Lisa on the right.  And we now have technology that can take these images and recreate what do their best guess is what the higher res image would be. So we have here on the left is a low-res image. What used to be the the our best approach Kier is now using our image technology. What were able to get to Emmett on the right is the ground truth if it were actually the high-res image you can say for most of these we get pretty darn close between what was used in the neural net and what we can what is actually the high-res image. Is there a company that are out there is one called a hand that I owe where you can go and put a low-res image and it will create you know that when you're doing that you're giving them data. So they're obviously making this a free platform so that they can increase and prove their technology, but you can go on and put a small image on and see what it comes up with and see how close it is to what you were expecting or what you wanted damaged today.  This is just a cool example using the same idea. There's this photo style transfer. So this is all available on GitHub. So you can see how this work is you and put an image and then you tell it what style you want to use and the output image tasting structure from the first photo and then uses the style from the second and it can be used for lots of cool pretty photos. But can also be used for images and you can create very realistic looking people that don't actually exist in real life. I'm so well, it's a cool pretty technology the effect is that is that this can generate images that aren't real that look very real and it starts to become obvious when we start talking about video. So here is what happens if the input is a video from a person and then you also input what you want that video to look like and then the output uses the emotions from the other input and the video then has the emotions of what this person had throughout the video rather than with the initial video looks like in a very  Real looking way too seriously of an evil like edit video but it hasn't looked really good or real and now that technology exists and it's pretty darn good and it is cool and it's really interesting technology, but you can see that there's lots of complications that could have negative effects. So what if you make a video of a politician saying something that they never actually said or try to tell somebody say that somebody committed a crime based on a video that is not actually real so manipulating reality is now more possible than ever and so we need to have ways to combat this and we don't we aren't as far a hot head on how to combat it as we are on the technology.  Okay, so I think this is a short one minute video about an MIT researcher and how he handled his child in the first year of birth by putting microphones all over their house.  Joey Votto, I'm sure seeing time lapse videos where a flower blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech Forum my son soon after his first birthday. What's a Gaga to mean water and over the course of the next half year? He slowly learn to consummate the proper adult form water. So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds no video here. So you can focus on the sound Acoustics of a new kind of trajectory the water.  Journal it didn't they?  Okay, so he put microphones all over his house recorded data for over a year and then they gave us to all of his research assistants are to analyze it and it's really cool and be at this nice too, but there's risks of personal privacy here. So if you have an Alexa in your home, it's recording from you. There have been discussions about how much it's learning from you. So I was constantly collecting data and figuring out what you might want to buy high-end determining how old am I.  What's the ethics for Gordon person? That doesn't know they're being recorded recording a person who doesn't know the recording the law differs state-to-state so it can change depending it like a legality of it determines whether or not if you're able to and in many states that you just have to one person in a conversation has to be aware that is being recorded. So like New York has that I can wear many faces in Pennsylvania. You have to inform the other person. So a lot of the times when you're on calling helplines and they inform you that you are being recorded for quality control Assurance on that is because of the legality so the ethics of it, I think personally.  People should all be aware that they're being recorded and when they're being recorded, this is a debate in the field as a whether or not that's true affection. So if you are an investigator on a crime there are places where if you got a warrant it would warrant using the only one aware to like on wiretaps and stuff like that. But I think in day-to-day life if you are being recorded you should know and so it Alexa you buy that I put it in your home and some people they okay while you put in your homie turn it on its allowed to record you at any time other people say, the only time I should be able to record you is when you say hey Alexa or whatever it is, they say to do things cuz I clearly don't have one of my house. So I think and it depends who you talk to you on that question polyp.  The ethics of recording your child. So the argument in the field would be that you are their parents or their caretaker. So you get to decide the similar argument is made in medical care. So you get to decide for them because they can't yet decide ice to end there are debating. There's no control over the fact, I think your arguments on both sides of a really great question.  NFL tonight  Similar ideas of privacy come up when these are the sorts of things and Technology take over. This was a few years ago work you put an image in. Kate Middleton. Google will let you know what famous artwork from around the world best matches that image. So this was a 60% match to a piece called strolling along the seashore and you can see that there are similarities here. And at the time there is a lot of debate in the field of like hey, what are they using to see if we're really you're just giving your picture to Google when you do this to her tell me what are twerking match doing if using something cool to do that. But this is the way the Google can quickly get a bunch of pictures from people around the world this interesting ly was not a technology available in Illinois or Texas because they have privacy laws against it. So it's there's something to do with private in the fact, they wouldn't allow this technology to roll out into of the states.  The same idea and same question to ask when that 10-year challenge happened a few months ago. We're on Facebook before posting a picture of them 10 years ago and her picture. Now this gives Facebook a ton of data to look at facial recognition and how things change over time. I've been amazed that Google in my Google photos can look at a baby when it was 6 months old and then three years later of my friends kids. It's able to identify that the same Thailand to me like this is only going to improve their technology. It's really cool. But also do you want to be giving your data way and that is up to you to decide?  So I have a another question about which of the following ethical concerns worries. You most for the future.  Give it a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so it's pretty spread across the border people are less concerned about self-driving cars and they tend to be about how and I will be used in healthcare when it comes to privacy Insurance predictability of or Automation in Warfare and intelligence and then given by a program to machine learning with your talk about a bit a few people said none other. Does anybody have any other they want to tell me that they were thinking of?  So this trend is pretty, whole to what we see in the field. So the question was asked a little differently you could say you were concerned about more than one the most popular was the bias that our machine learning. This has been in the news. So it's assault on a lot of people's minds and data science field and then people were also concerned about AI in intelligence and surprisingly to me less concerned about Automation in healthcare and how that could be used to terminate or not accurately predict disease based on the oven as we come up with.  What does another place where I wanted to point out that when your data scientist you might not think like everybody else? So here is an interesting visualization not how I would have done it, but I will be either good in the world. The dark is far fat in the world or no change as light as far as you can see that 75% of people or data scientist think it will be good. We're at the professionals think that the they think it's most likely to be bad in the world has in mind when you are pushing forward with your AI that you should probably consult people that are not like minded as you to see what they're concerned about here. And when you want to take a look at this and I want if anybody can tell me what this is trying to show cuz I have been confused by this for 2 days. This is really just you all trying to tell me what this says cuz I'm confused a bit at the top the question. If you can't read it is a I more or less biased than people would a scientist turn green and ethics professionals are in Gray if you want to chat with each other and then I'm like really hoping somebody can tell me why I don't understand it because it is what it is you I want to hear. What is the showing  What is the take-home message here?  La Quinta Greenway in Franklin  All right. I've heard some confusion. Mermaids do people have interpretations yet.  Okay, so maybe so yes of these numbers don't add up to a hundred. So you think maybe there's three categories less biased not by a civil and then they just didn't show the more biased that was the closest. I got to understanding this and we have a different interpretation.  Is an artistic representation of a bias that we don't have all the data. I like that any other thoughts.  outside of their  okay, so maybe that that there's not a big difference between the two and that does not have a lot of concerned. So there is there either less biased or Not by as it also. There's not many people that are more. Is that the capture your thought more time it mess it up.  Clothes that is not a ton of concern was the name.  I so I don't know the answer. I read the report. I don't have the date of a used to generate this. I phone the words they use in a report. It seems to me like ethics professional were more concerned than data scientist. Where is worth more likely to say not by us at all. I have a feeling they just like didn't check and edit this one as well as they wanted to the words and the picture didn't really sit together. So I was mostly just I figured I'd have a few minutes where I'd have you all tell me if I'm completed because I don't really know what this green bar represents. I think this is not biased and I think these are left for the question was more or less by so I'm still confused. So why would the last thing that I want to say was at the number of responses for people staying in which of the following scenarios would be appropriate for a guy to make decisions without human interaction? So they sorted it. So the things were people more people said it's fine to not have humans like select the entertainment. A lot of people are fine with Netflix.  Choosing for you what you might most likely want to see next smle for populating social media page for like fine with computers doing that but we are less fine with determining jail sentences hiring job candidates or determining College admittance without human being involved in the process of this is the current state of the field and they'll run is each year so we can see how it changes over time where the some people said that none of this was. Okay. That humans should always out have some type. Okay last few slides. You are all the future data science or doing cool things with data. So I'm going to tell you what I think I would like you all to remember from this course if nothing else so probably no surprise. The first thing is that they should always be a priority in your work. I want you to consider this when your boss to tell you to do something you shouldn't do or when you are thinking about your questions whether or not you should be answering them.  Also would love for you all to go for it and think of data wrangling at the puzzle rather than something that's super boring.  I want you all know that is nice is competitive but rewarding so you have a chance to make a big difference and might not be easy everywhere along the way but it's still rewarding and I wanted her to know that the great and of course, it's probably not predicted with you. So you could have struggled in this course or not done perfectly well or not like the way I talk about data science and still going to be super super successful where you could have done really really well on sync data science is not for you and flooring and all that aside and get other data points and do projects and see if you like it and hope is a you all go on to continue to be good people who are happy and successful and thanks for taking the time.  I'm coming out to the cookies.  I did. Have a great day for Locust idols. "
