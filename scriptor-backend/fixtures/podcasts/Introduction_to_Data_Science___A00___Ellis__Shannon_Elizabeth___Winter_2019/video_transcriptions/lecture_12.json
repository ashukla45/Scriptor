    "Full Transcript": "All right, if people filter in had a feeling we might be a little late today the weather's not great. And it sounds like they cheated if there's time I'm at the end of today's horse will do the python Notebook on data visualization and exploratory data analysis. There's a chance that we don't get to it and we just do like for the whole time Court reminders is everybody settled in is that you have your fourth reading quiz do this Friday? And then your third assignment due next Friday. So on until this this lecture is title of data visualization to we already had the first one a better name for this is really visualization for communication. So this applies to data science projects for really to anytime you are presenting information to other people and presenting graphs and plots and telling people something they need to know.  So, please let me practice R to describe how to internally improve data visualization to how to work upon the types of graphs and pot that you seen already and to really make them tell the story tell your point and make them good visually and then to take a look at visualisations and describe both are good and less than ideal aspects. I'm going to give you all the time today when I show you a visualization that might not be great to talk to each other talk about what you would change in it. I remove a few slides from the lecture will get to that point. I'll post all of them afterwards but it said that you can't really see the answer while and have you all think about it to make sure that you all have a chance to think about it. Okay, so we can talk about this data science process. We've been working through this and we found through exploratory data analysis, and we're going to talk about analyzing data, but I wanted to talk about how you communicate results before we actually show the different types of ways. You can get results that you can think about it during these analyses on how given the type of mouses you would do.  How you would present this information to somebody else?  The really the reason I have a whole lecture on why effective date of communication matters is because when he went to the real world or when you're in a class, it's often. The only thing that people say so you just really super intricate analysis to see all the steps they did they see your results and they see how you present it and it allows you to stay at your work apart from other. So lots of people at a company will be doing interesting analyses, but if you can really get your message across clearly show wife and four and a half people act upon what you've done it will make you stand out and it helps to show up the awesome stuff you've done is that called native load is a thing if you put way too much information in front of somebody and expect them to interpret it. That's not going to be as effective is really just highlighting the point you want to highlight and telling people how to act  So we in the first visualization lecture, we talked largely about graphs and tables. I just want to remind everybody for grass. You have two scales to axies and you visualize variables and a relationship. So some examples are scatter plot box plot Sandbar Parts. This is just to review from the last lecture and tables or were you just playing just playing summaries of information about your data set and some tabular format where you have rows and columns.  There are also Matt's these are visualisations will cover how to display information on a map in a effective way in a layer lecture. There's one to mention that these count as data visualizations and these are good ways to give a point when your are to convey your point when you're showing information that where the spatial relationship matters.  Diagrams are also visualizations not something will focus on here. But here there schematic pictures where the park or symbolic so you have labels point of the things where you want somebody to get something from the dryer. So it's not necessarily getting data information to other people but effective way for people to understand what you're talking about in a system where they might not be as familiar.  Sharks are similar again, not presenting summaries of data and charts for your showing the relationships between lots of different things. So could be a flow chart explaining where your analysis started the filtering sets. You did how many people you ended up with at the atoms that people understand the process you went through.  The last time I want to talk about it affect the infographics are becoming more and more popular. You see them in journalism. You see them on the internet all the time sheet people share them on Facebook. I'm an able Graphics are just a combination of graph and diagram designed to convey a message to hear. We'll talk about this with a little later in the lecture. There's some information about what's been going on in Iraq and their highlighting that Dexter on the decline and all of these plots show some part of that sort out their summer really bad. So I'm a really good we won't focus on how to make a grandpa graphic. I just want to make sure that everybody had some idea of all the different ways that you can convey a message when you're communicating information. I'm in a presentation or in a report in an email.  Okay, so we're still good focus on graphs and tables the same way that I mentioned in the First Data visualization lecture. These are the six types that we talked about in the last lecture not going to review these here. You should be somewhat familiar with these and when you would use them, this is just to remind you. I wanted to talk about three other types of visualizations that are graphs that we can consider today. And when we're trying to make good visualization, the reason I didn't talk about these last lecture is cuz they're a little more detailed and they're more helpful when you're trying to make really good plots and I'll explain what I mean by that in a second when we haven't talked about is a line plot. This is what he want to show some sort of quantitative Trend overtime. So typically the x-axis would be time and then the y-axis would be the quantity and you would be able to see the trend overtime were things decrease where they say the same and then where they increased this is just for a single series. Here's when you have different groups and here's when you're comparing one group to multiple groups of this would be an example.  You are at a company. Your product has some sort of price that has changed over time and you want to look at its price price of your product of a relative to your competitors. So that could be b c and d so I'll send your highlighting one and looking to see where that falls relative to competitors are other people with similar products Define, but you've seen a number of times are grouped bar charts. So this was the one about how much of the material presented in the first third of the class was new to each of you. And this was a broken down by gender. So here we're seeing a categorical variable down here were there were five options and then here where we've broken it down by two of the gender categories and we see the distribution changes a little bit between female and male. So this is when you're comparing how do values were spread out for one category versus another two categorical variables hear the percent of the material and gender and we're just playing it on  Grouped bar chart chart for looking at a quantitative Trend overtime bar chart can be grouped and when you have a group or charger April look at more than one categorical variable at a time.  The last new type of chart I'm going to Define and introduce is a stacked bar chart here is when you were looking at counter proportions across two categorical variable. So she had it all set up to 100% And you can start to see the trends across different items and their Colors by whether or not you disagree in the blackish grey or agree or strongly agree in the blue and a new shows here in the middle. So you can start to see where people agree the most and I'll be on survey item a or quickly see where they disagree the most on survey DND. So in your stocking a bar chart looking at the trends across the different categories  So Heather 6 or so initial data visualizations, I've added in line charts Group bar charts and stacked bar chart. These are all of the things we talked about in the first data visualization lecture about using good colors about choosing the right chart type. I'm making sure everything's labeled. The things are big enough that the numbers reflect the data and that the comparisons are easy on your readers. He's also Friday. I'm going to add on to this for the visualisations were talking about today.  In order to accomplish all of these and then tell a story and make sure that your visualizations are really communicating what you want it takes time. So as you guys visualize data for classes for your boss and a future for your project a lot yourself a lot more time than you think you're going to need because it takes a lot longer to really generate a good visualization. Then it seems like it should take  Okay, summer break down visualizations into two major categories. They're our exploratory visualization and explanatory visualisations. So exploratory visualisations and walkthroughs are the types that I showed you last lecture when you are generating a lot of pots trying to understand your data. Your goal is understand the data not necessarily make the prettiest or best plot you've ever made alternatively for explanatory visualization. These are the ones you at the end of your project want to really convey your message and tell your audience what they should be taken away from your work. Then you want to spend a lot of time working to make your visualization as good as pause the portal a quick make a lot of these they don't have to be perfect explanatory spend the time on the few that will really communicate your message and your point and those ones are explanatory Plus.  Example here is an exploratory plot what you guys I'll probably take from this is that we have something changing over time and there's some value. So if you were generating mystery exploratory data analysis, you know what you're plotting and you know what you're expecting these values represent. So time, you take a look at it increases over time and that's fine if it's an exploratory visualization, but if you want to tell your company to do something based on this, but you're not really conveying what they should do or what the point of this is to have to improve it.  This is the end and we're going to look at all the things I have changed here. There's different uses of color. There's highlighting different lines are thicker than others. We make sure that the activities are explain their Source information where the data came from and there's a title that tells you what you should take away where Walter all the steps in this one by one. I just whenever you know that the exploratory version is over here. You got a quick look at the data and this is what you generate on what you're doing exploratory data analysis. You're making a lot of these alternatively when you are presenting information writing a report or send an email to lots of people in your company. That's when you spend the time to really improve your visualization and make an explanatory visualization.  Any questions so far about what I mean when I'm talking about an explanatory visualization when you would use a line plot or a group bar chart or a stacked bar chart?  So when you're creating the explanatory data visualization, it's an iterative process and it rains over the fact that you first have to decide what your point is. What's the message? You want to convey to your viewers to the people listening to your presentation to the people reading your report. Once you determine what that is put that as your headline as a title on your plot, then you determine how you could emphasize that point. So this could be emphasized by deciding which chart type most accurately conveys your message but a Charming what data should be included on the plot by choosing colors carefully by determining what you should highlight on the plot carefully and determining what annotations you should have sanitation's are parts of your chart that you highlighted with a box or put text next to to Really draw people's attention to it after you determine how you can emphasize your point and look at what you've built. And you said how does this really what did we really communicating here? Does this description match what we're trying to convey to the Legends and keys most clearly  Describe what's going on in the flat and had their Source been included. I told me to walk to that example where I just showed you with the trend over time. I'm taking each of these into consideration.  So excited you start by making your first exploratory plot.  Anything about this, what's your point? So you then determine that you're trying to explain that iPhones are more successful successful than all other Apple products and I told him leave the message you want to convey?  To decide where your point is, but you realize that you need to have all of the information here. So you make sure that the day that matches your point and your headline.  What emphasize your point you don't want before? We had to Spaghetti of three red lines. You don't really know what you're trying to look at overtime. So you want to highlight the line and it doesn't projectile that well, but there a light gray line down here you highlight the point in that iPhones are more successful than the other Apple products. So you're able to draw the viewer's attention using a secure line and a red line and then gray Fade Into the background, but you can still use it for comparison. So great day to visit visualizers use gray a lot and it's just there to include data that is not where your eyes supposed to go.  They also added this doesn't reject. Well, I'll have to redo this visualization. So there is a gray box right around here in 2010 and 2011 and they include the sanitation. It says Apple after Apple announce the iPhone 4 in 2010 more iPhones were sold in iPod for the first time. So they're looking where the red line starts to take off relative to the Gray Line.  Now taken what your point is you added that as a title and then you've emphasized it using this red line making that red line sticker adding an annotation to draw your attention to where this Transtar to take off the other lines for comparison.  The last question is what does the final charge show exactly? So if you sit back and look at that, we still haven't included what all these numbers are here. So there's a new generator this data visualization that decided to put in the subtitle here and say that we're looking at worldwide sales of selected Apple products in millions. So now we know what this axis is see what different feelings on this. I would much rather have an axis label over here and have it up here, but we're going to talk about this today that a lot of these choices or design choices that there's not always a definitive right answer but you do need to make sure we're going to the weather not you put the axis label over here or up here that people know what these numbers represent these numbers over here represent worldwide sales. So now we know that worldwide sales are increasing over time, and we're on the order of million.  Tab a better description of what information is displayed.  They also chose to directly label the data. So, you know, this is now iPhone this is iPad. And this is iPod a lot of times people use Legends, but that requires you to know if you would had a legend over here that was a red line is iPhone. The other ones are iPad and iPod. You don't have to take your eyes back to figure out what it is. So if you only have a few categories directly labeling, the lines is really really helpful.  And the last point is you should always include the source of where your data came from so that people can take a look at where your information came from and whenever that's applicable.  Okay, so lots of changes you see that decisions were made basically at every point in the supply and next time I give his lecture. I will take their pot and regenerate it because not everything for text. And now I know that start with all the trend explanatory. Somebody can look at it whether or not you're there and determine the story figure out what they're supposed to focus on in the visualization.  Despite is a tear to this explain what happened at each point. All right. So for the first clicker question again, it's a day for the frequency code.  I want y'all to talk to each other and determine what's going on in this and determine if it is is a good explanatory visualization.  I'll give it a few more seconds.  3  2 1  I took majority of people said that this is not a good explanatory visualization. Let's talk a bit about what you like and what you dislike about this visualization.  Okay, so the title is wrong Shoppers begins shopping for holidays. Not a very clear title. That doesn't tell you what you should learn from this plot. I agree to titled an issue here other positive or negative.  Okay. So the point is that the x-axis for the time scale. Is it very clear and it's not regular so we have before September who knows what that means September October November and then we break December down into two sets of weeks and it's just not as clear. So you should have spread them out that they're evenly showing time or label these better to make them better to make this more clear. I think that's a great point. What else is what else is going on here any good things?  All right, you'll have a chance in a second to completely redesign and talk about this. So if we need to change everything that's fine other bad thing other negative things about this lot.  Okay, so I think the point is you can't see the conclusion when you first look at it quickly. You're not sure exactly what you're supposed to take away from it. It's very busy. There are lots of colors and their these lines in the background that don't really serve a purpose cuz I'm not really helping you got anything. The numbers are kind of squishy. You can just look at it and figure out what the conclusion is.  Any other thoughts?  All right to the Y axis isn't labeled. We don't know what this percentage is agree.  I know the thoughts.  Okay, so this is an example where I want to see what y'all suggest as what we should change to make this a better visualization consider the chart type consider the colors consider the axis labels and we talked about a few of them, but I'll ask a few questions in a second. First of a few times. We do the T-Rex or chat with each other. And then if you have some thoughts on how to improve that we haven't talked about yet to say if you're stuck and can't think of anything else on Tuesday.  Give it a few more seconds.  3212 the same type of plot. Would you still use a bar chart to display? If you would use the same type? I hope you have a few raise a hand if you've talked about using a different type of plot.  Okay, so now maybe a few so does anybody want to explain what other type of chart you might use for flight you would use.  Look at that in the second. What do you think about the colors in? The label is NVIDIA ideas of how they would change the colors in the labeling?  Tire  all right, so we could declutter this a little bit instead of going by to we could maybe go by 5 or make this just a slightly less clutter glasses. I think that's great.  NFL team colors or labeling  Like I care.  Okay, so they're two points in there, which were both great. Let's think about how we could Better Label is x-axis to make it clearer and more consistent. And then the second one is that maybe a line plot showing the trend over time between these groups would be a better visualization think those are two great points another point.  Okay, so these percent on top of the bars are not really serving a helpful purpose here. They're kind of hard to determine what their and they're not serve your purpose if we have this y-axes here. So we maybe don't need this repetitiveness in the labels here and the labels on the bars because they're saying the same information or any other thoughts the people expressing thoughts that are going on here.  Example of one of the sides that's not in this life that I gave all posted all after. So the data are what they are and how they were broken down. So I think if you were to go back and collect these you would want to make sure they're at regular time intervals, but they have cleaned up the x-axis here. We've also point out and the first thing is we've cleaned up this title more women start their holiday shopping early today that in the title and then and how they use the coloring do they have the places where females shot started their shopping earlier when it's higher than males and it's darker pink and then what is lower in the spider pink Dave declutter the y-axis and just directly labeled so that these are now serving a purpose they're clear rather than smushed on top of the bar. They got rid of all the background information here and they're really drawn your attention to the point that is being generated McGrath any questions about how this has improved it.  Also know that a line plot would be appropriate here. So I think the bar chart has a great job but a line plot would show you where the line crosses with the men depend upon what store you want to tell?  That's the one up with a few more. We're going to talk about color a little bit in this one. We showed that we use gray to take the one Katerina background really highlight. The one we are trying to talk a lot of considerations to make when you're taking a pot from exploratory pot to an explanatory pot.  So in these the Ono the colors on these don't display great either. So what this says that you can't see and I'll fix this is this does not ideal and this says ideal so they're going to be an example of what not to do on the left side and example of what is better on the right side with this is conveying is that gradients when you're using like light to dark color gradients are what you use for continuous variables here. We're talking about categories. So you should use the distinct colors cuz this suggests there's something some relationship between these where Lisa is light and Ivan is dark rather just four different categories. So use gradients are continuous variables and distinct colors for categories.  Somebody here at the not ideal is over here. I'm going to fix the colors on all of these and then leave what you should do is over here. So why you shouldn't do is if you have a quantitative variable that goes from a loan number reflecting poor to a high number reflecting Rich. You should not use the colors to show the gradient rather use the plot plot values from poor to rich and then categorize the individuals and color the bars based on the people in the groups. So let your plot highly the values that plot you've chosen to your highlights the gradient from poor to rich and then use the colors to specify the individuals within each group is just a better way to convey this information over here rather than having people link back and forth within groups. Compare it all at once.  All right. So there's a hard rule that more than 7 color suggest. You need a different chart. I showed you a lot last class where people have trouble figuring out what's going on with only five colors. So keep in mind that the more colors are trying to get people to look through the harder to a time. They're going to have interpreting what you want out of it. The cognitive load is higher than to spend more time figuring out what's going on. So I'll set in color is certainly suggests that you need a different chart getting up to the three to five colors really makes it more difficult on the viewer.  Another thing is color consistency manager often not just showing one pot to people when you're making a presentation. So it's really important your consistent throughout. So but not ideal over here. Is it in your first plot? You make some data from the UK red and data from China blue. Don't later on make China red and Germany blue. You have to be consistent throughout. So if it's UK red China blue and your next visualization China should be blue and your other country should be a different color people pretty good at math paint colors and remembering what they represented in a presentation. So later on don't confuse them cuz they will think when they're looking here. This represents China. What is a fact Germany to pick a color for your category and a make sure you use that throughout all of your visualization.  That's one we talked about things. We talked about labeling make sure that everybody knows what their numbers represent and what the colors represent so you should always be clear to label your axes and be sure to make make sure that your viewers know what the colors represent. So if you're showing a light green or dark blue make sure you include that that dark blue is a hundred and that light green is zero say to the categories. You just always want to make sure people know what use color represent and you can do that with text. So red always Arps in China and blue always represents Germany. You can just include that in the text you've included.  I mention this but I want to make sure we had it in the color part. This is known as a spaghetti plot. The only thing you can interpret from this is the general Trend that most things go up over here. Okay, so there are lots of lighter lines and gray and then you highlight the one that you're most interested in. So if you're only trying to show that everything goes up just make them all gray cuz the colors don't matter if you want to highlight one line amongst other lines, you can high like that with color. So great is your friend.  What kind of pictures and colors there is debate in the field at the how we should represent different things that we often fought there are some rules and again this comes back to cognitive load. So people in society today. This could change over time and is historically not always been the case. But today people associate red with that. So if you are trying to get people to understand that more than half is good don't choose red for good similarly and maybe more clearly if you have data about a forest and data Battle Lake people associate blue with lakes and greens with for so don't make people work harder than they have to put people will just get confused. The same idea is here and this is where a lot of the debate comes in is whether or not female should always be represented in pink and males should be in blue and I don't think I have to be the case but I would argue that this is difficult to interpret for people and they look at a at a glance cuz they associate blue with mail again in history. It has been flipped on but right now in Tucson  Blue is associated mail. So you don't have to use pink or purple for female but don't flip the blue in the tank. So good. Use Green Lakes represent with blue mailed are associated with blue.  Okay, any questions so far about the types of colors you would use the types of plot what it means to take a plot from exploratory to explanatory.  Choosing good colors your goal is to improve your data didn't greccio. So we  So an example of this without male to female Shopper, but we didn't necessarily Define it. So what does that mean? Is that everything on your page should serve a purpose. So the more you put in front of it in front of the viewer the more they have to spend time figuring out what it means. You should take a look at your visualization. And if something doesn't serve a purpose and isn't telling your story or making your point more clear or move it or edit it so decluttering at the boulders. We've already talked about decluttering to access when we had a gun for 24682. Maybe making that more spread out. We talked about removing grid lines from the back of your class. Cuz none of those are helping your viewer understand your point. We're talking about the date of the engracio. It's that you should have less ink on the page and just highlight for the data.  All right, so I'm going to give you all a chance to look at this visualization think about the ways in which you can improve this chart. Think about what message you might wanted to tell and I'm going to ask you all to think about this from the perspective of somebody who works at a company who who sells bacon. All right. So it's it's I'm going to have you all think about what the point is how you can answer size it what you would change about this plot. So chat with each other think about what you would improve and will then chat about it.  If you're stuck chat with your neighbors, see what they're thinking.  Going to be a few more seconds.  5321 who wants to start telling me what they would change what they would approve or if they think they spot is perfect as is.  So they suggested that we could remove pizza and chili dog, which are healthier than bacon. I would argue we shouldn't do that. We should display all of the data, but we can highlight our point if we're working at a baking company and then we are going to follow up.  Okay, so the other asset that other argument here is that we could change this y-axis to make the differences look bigger and you were thinking like a marketer at a company and that is how you would make it look more deceptive than make the differences look different. But if you want to display all of the data, which of them going to argue our goal is data scientist. I'm going to argue against doing that but that would reflect all the changes that you want and probably sell more bacon. So any other thoughts  So the company can remove the legend and because it's completely additional to what we already have down here on the x-axis. I agree with that.  Okay. So yeah, that is a great white. So you think french fries should be yellow because we associate french fries with yellow. So if you're going to use color is here at all that bacon is fine as red, but maybe we should make sure that the other ones reflect the color of the food in South. I think that's a good suggestion. There's another coming right behind you still have. Yeah.  Okay, so there, there is that we don't necessarily even need different colors for all of these because we have the labels but you could make bacon Stand Out by letting out of the color and leaving all the others Gray.  Great, cuz you're trying to sell bacon. Maybe I'll make potato chips green because we associate green with healthy. That's a great point. I was also the overall design of the plot.  I'll tell you all my thoughts. So this plot like feels heavy. There's this gray background. There's this like textured brownish color. There's a lot going on so you can remove most of that and we didn't talk at all about labels what's good is that you have type of food labeled and you have the number of calories. So, you know, it's being visual is visualized. If we don't know if they have the best most informative Title Here, I got to talk before I move on you.  Play food, right?  puppies in a hundred grams  Right, right.  Okay, so if you were trying to sell more bacon, if you could show data that reflect more accurately reflect the truth and that it's torque per serving healthier than maybe pizza would be so there are different ways that you could plot that you can use data to make your point and it is thought.  Okay. So this was somebody else's version of improving this and I think a lot of the things we talked about still stayed out. So we came up with some of these suggestions in that color in this red removing that Legend get rid of the background. I still don't think this is the best title or the best data if you really want to sell taken but this is the way you would highlight your point relative to others and your title might be something like bacon healthier then potato chips and french fries as a snack that could be something you could conclude from these data.  But we're going to do with this simple a similar exercise for the next to I want you to look at this figure out what he's trying to say then consider what your point is how you can emphasize that point in your church and whether or not Detroit type the data the color of the highlights of annotations should chase the child each other and then we'll talk about this one.  Activate a few more seconds.  at 3 to 1  I don't want to tell me the point of this graph. What did you take away from it?  What is it displaying? I didn't give you a lot of information. You might not even be able to figure it out from what's up there?  Okay, so we have tickets to the volume received and this was taken volume process or just small here. So it's hard to tell so we're talking about in this case and you're right tickets how it changes over time. So he were talking about take it that you like submit to an IT department. So we'll be tickets received and how many they successfully work through and which I probably would've been helpful that I explained that up front that they took from this pot. What's it trying to show?  Process more tickets than theirs. So the question is in May.  Today received a hundred anime process 181 it because it's a trend over time. So it would have been at a backlog from what they hadn't processed gone through previously, but that is exactly what you should be doing. When you're looking to spot like are there numbers that don't make sense to you when you're looking at the data and those are starting to think that you might have to go back to the apartment. And how do you have more processed than you received any certain month?  That's the general thought about what's going on here. Some numbers being displayed on the y-axis and have time on the x-axis I so who wants to explain whether or not they would change chart type data color highlights annotations anything in there.  Yeah.  Okay, so it went up there without a few a lot more effective if we change the the type of chart to a line chart and I agreed that I cut you off to do another.  Well, okay. I just want to make sure I didn't cut you off. Okay, so I agree with that wholeheartedly anybody have other thoughts on how they would approve a spot? Yeah.  So it's not very clear what store you're trying to tell her. We're not really sure what the ticket processing and receiving is we don't know for sure what this y-axis is. I think that's really good cuz we want to make sure that that's clear and whatever we do to improve it.  Okay, so there's some confusion about why there's this Gap here great question will come back. We might go back to overlook it on the improved one. But that is nothing like you should look at these anomalies in what's going on there my gas and I don't I don't make a situation is that that would be the end of the fiscal year so could have something to do with that. They want like show what it restart. But do you need to convey that maybe not and it only just kind of looks weird with a gap in here, but I completely agree that that  Okay, so maybe using the bar chart to look at these values from zero is not exactly what we want in a line chart might help improve to look at what how similar these are how different they are from one another that the comparison we want to make.  They're not a thot.  Alright, so this is the improved version. I'll give you all a second to read this take a look at it. See if the story makes a little more sense here and determine whether or not there's anything you would change about this one.  Is anybody ready to summarize for me the point of this visualization now having looked at this graph?  How many years?  Okay. Okay. So we're showing at overtime that in the beginning and of the Year, we're doing really good job keeping up and then we sit at 2 employees quit. We now have a sanitation showing you the split point and for a little while they were pretty much keep up and then it just keeps spreading all over time or just not able to keep up now and last when you made was that we need to hire somebody else tells a story draw your eye into an action that happened in it gives you the numbers care but doesn't clutter it here where the numbers are essentially the same would give effect of your points. Right? Like if they're super close to me. We don't need to know what's 160 + 160 one but now we start to see just how big the Gap is between what we received. And what were you able to process and up here at the top to the title point. It's clear what action you want your company to take you want them to a higher approve the hiring of more people so that you can fix this. So this is a much better job telling the story than just plodding the data on a bar chart and we didn't get this cat nearly as easily.  This chart on the left as we do from what's on the right any questions our final thoughts on that one.  Okay to do the same exercise for this last one what we have here on the left or pre survey information to how do you feel about doing science people had different options of what they could say. They had some intervention that was teaching people more about science and at the end they ask students again. How do you feel about doing science and then recorded their answers?  It's okay. My dear here. What's your point? How do you emphasize it? Do we need to change anything about the chart type the date of the color of the highlights in the annotations?  David each other  get something out if you need to.  Get over a few more seconds.  All right who has thoughts about how they would improve or it let's start with the first question. What's the point of this plot?  What is it currently can bang to you?  Tomatoes contain they did a pre and post survey and not much else but like what might they want to convey. What do you what is the question you want to know after knowing that these data exist?  Okay, do you want to know whether or not that thing? They did in the middle here worked. So you want your grass to be able to conclude that in some way? So you want to know what they did to you probably explain that in your presentation, but you want to know whether or not there's a difference between this and this and that doesn't really come through here. So we wanted to know that how would we emphasize what type of chart would we use? How would we change this up with? How would we use color and labeled?  Quick before and after 4 or 3. Okay. I don't think that because I didn't board should be almost to color ends of the spectrum here bored and excited both in blue and next to each other on the pot which doesn't really convey the stories. We want to change the colors. So we're highlighting the point we want to make and we want to change the type of chart to a bar chart where we would group them together. Here.  So we should have put red and green together. If we want them to differentiate between Red and Green Bay certainly you would have when he was ready to separate and if you aren't you wouldn't put them next to each other? Cuz those are be hard to differentiate. I think that's a great Point bar chart. We have highlight the thing you actually wanted people to look at and we also have don't put red and green next to each other other thought. Yeah.  Or Nah Creo que and humans bar and couch bar is this made by different colors like the represents their proportion after  after that, we will have more support for a bar chart and is yours where you have the pre and post next to each other and to the one you're envisioning or did you have  and I'm not sure there we can take a look at it.  I never thought I'd like the idea of a bar chart.  Pancake mix rice and shaving foam safe excited to work Saturday. We have a beer.  Okay, so we're going to group them based on their response up here, but we want to make sure they're in a logical order so that it starts at bored at one end and end up excited on the other.  Any other thoughts before we talk about a solution to this one yet?  Or did not great. There's really not that much of a change whereas there is a change from OK and excited so you can see that only certain groups relation.  Okay. Okay. So I'm going to try everybody who's talking about the bar chart together. So we want to bar chart we want to make sure that the axis is in an order that makes sense. And we want to make sure that we are comparing things next to each other between pre and post so you can see where things did different pre to post and where they didn't change much things are all grade.  So this is largely what y'all suggested here where we are putting pre and post we're ordering in a sensible order from bored too excited. We're not putting red and green next to each other. In fact, we're only going to use blue to highlight and gray for everything else. I want to really highlight where people went from okay decreased in post and that you can see clear that those people ended up toward kind of interested and excited after program more children were kind of interested and excited about science have stuff to area text to guide our eyes to what the conclusion is. We see what question was asked and we know that before the program the majority of children felt just okay about science. Gray matches the gray over here the blue matches the blues are a lot of really great design principles hear the story comes through the window point out that there's not always one way to visualize data.  Sometimes you just put the number up there and you can make your point at the pilot program 68% of kids expressed interest towards night. Now this doesn't give you an idea of all the data what's in there. So if you really want people to understand what you did and what changed sticks of it.  If you just any of if you told people a lot of information already knew just want them to get the take-home message make the number big the same thing something we haven't talked about is a slope graph this it conveys the same information we have before and after we can see okay decreased and excited and kind of interested increased. I think the bar chart is an obvious choice by one to show that you can show the same story in different ways and the choosing that depends upon your audience and how used to looking at grass like this they are  Are any questions about the date of the increase yield? The general take-home is that less is more get rid of anything. You don't need it'll be more effective more attracted and it will have a bigger impact questions on that aspect appreciate all the thoughts on how to improve these the y'all did a really good job. Okay. So given that today is Valentine's Day. I have a few visualisations that I want you all to take a look at everything you need to know to get started an explanatory data visualization. So I want you all to let me know if this is a good excellent or data visualization.  Metallic each other see what it's displaying.  Can I read a few more seconds?  3 2  1  all right.  so  usually you all agree with me. And this one you'd also I don't get is a very good excited for data visualization board you say that is so I want to hear from you. Why you think it's a good visualization? Cuz there are good visualization at that this one so who are the tell me either why they said yes, or why they said no,  What is the percentages don't add up to a hundred and it kind of uses circles? So it feels like they should.  And the problem here with that is a people could have said they're doing both so you could buy a card and flowers and then you would be into different categories, but your mind doesn't pick that up using circles with circles to us. They that we should have 100% that's not really clear from the visualization. So I like that point other thought about good or bad here.  Visual entertaining it gives you a point so you can see what there's pictures of each of the categories and it's not very cluttered. So you get to see what people buy and at some percentage. The reason I didn't like this visualization is cuz it didn't come through to me that the height of these like 3D bars that are tilting are the number that they're reflecting like this one supposed to be 52% high and this one's supposed to be 13% high. So it's really hard for our brains to figure that out. We can after looking at it, but they do for the numbers here. They ordered and decreasing number they very well label what's going on and there's not a ton of colors going on at so we have some idea what's going on here.  All right again with the themes for today stuff small here is our marriage rate in the United States and the x-axis is time and this part is depending upon your thoughts on marriage decreasing. So overtime getting married at a slower rate over time. All right, we'll get down cuz it's just broken down by state.  And this is all of that information summarized. So this is a type of plot that we'll talk about later on in the course when we get to geospatial analysis. We can see that the rates differ across the country. And apparently I learned from this Hawaiians get married much at a much higher rate and have overtime relative to the rest of the country.  A little bit more to talk about with regards to actually communicating information. So we talked about how you design the visualizations. What's that? You should go through. I totally approve it on but we haven't talked about how to communicate it. So your Communications should tell a story and stories have beginning middle and end and so when you're presenting information either in a report or in giving a talk, you should always in the beginning provide context tell your audience what they need to know to figure out and understand what you're saying. There's a time and then tell your audience what you're going to tell them in the middle show them tell them you was good visualisations and then at the end summarize what you said and remind them what it is that you told them and this is something I have trouble remembering and you'll see throughout the course. I try to tell stories lecture. I try to have the whole course to tell a story but sometimes I forget that repetition is okay. I may be familiar with the topic, but the information is new to my audience. Usually I'm so it's okay to tell them what you're going to tell them then tell them and then the remind them what you told them.  In addition to designing things to tell a story to make sure all the information necessary is there it's important to think about who your audience is and what a relationship is to the audience if you've been in a company for 25 years and everybody knows who you are and trust your work. You don't have to spend a lot of time explaining who you are or getting there traffic probably believe what you say just because they know who you are and also you should think about whether or not your audience is the technical as you are or not. And that determines what types of visualization you should show them.  Addition to who always think about what your audience needs to know. What's the most important? And what do you want them to do after it? We saw that example where we said, please hire to people because we can't keep up with our work anymore because people quit it fine to tell them what you want them to do.  Also if their point is that your design choices alter the tone of your message, I want you all to take a look at two different ways that the same data can be visualized not visualized and think about the design choices. They made between these two. I'll give you a second to look at them.  ABS thoughts on what the design choices how they affect the tone of the message here.  It's on the left we have is Iraq's bloody toll we now have red and it's kind of looks like blood dripping so over here the point is that Dexter on the decline. We see that over time they decreased and hear their highlight and the fact that Iraq has been incredibly bloody overall. So the way you choose to visualize your data determines what tone and what message you will send to your audience to always keep in mind that your design choices alter the tone.  The last one is how are you expected to communicate to your audience? The most common for analyses is you're either talking about it or you're writing it down in a report?  I want a reminder that when you're presenting out loud don't read off the slides. Like I did just they're okay with the story of Little Red Riding Hood.  Alright, so we have a few so for people who are unfamiliar with Little Red Riding Hood and we'll get to the point as to why I'm telling you. They're the story of Little Red Riding Hood is that your grandmother Red Riding Hood's grandmother has fallen ill and Red Riding Hood is going with a basket of goodies to go visit her grandma on the way there. She encounters a Woodsman and a wolf and the Wolf Run the head goes to Grandma's house each gram Diamond dresses up in Grandma's clothes later on Red Riding Hood arrived and she senses that something is off. So she asked a series of questions to her to the wolf dressed up as grandma and Grandma house being your teeth are at which point the wolf eats Red Riding Hood and besides a better deal with it and then Heats Red Riding Hood and then later on The Woodsman who she met earlier walks by season or two grandmas open senses. Something's off goes in Caesar wolfline asleep after his meal takes is a cut them in half an outcome grandma and Little Red Riding Hood unscathed and  Everybody ended well, except for the walk. Okay, if you weren't familiar now, you are however and lots of presentation for businesses or for data scientist or people telling information. This is how they would show you they would say. I have a new phone with everyone in Little Red Riding Hood because Red Riding Hood have to walk 24 miles from point A to point C Her Clothes Red Riding Hood arrive at Grandma's at 2 p.m. Ask you three questions the promise and identified after the third question and wolf eats Red Riding Hood solution from the van work van der represented by The Woodsman is Act II. How come grandma and Red Riding Hood alive wolf is not. Okay. So I was going to have to click a question to see which one you all enjoyed more, but I'm not I'm just going to determine the conclusion that this is not quite as interesting as telling people story. So if the information is understandable and does not need to be spelled out for people to understand it, just tell them if you are in a live presentation.  So that's why I put the information on there but make sure that there's necessary that you're talkin and people don't pay attention as long as they're reading. The next one is use animation to build your story not to distract any benefit from having words to explain out loud what you're showing when it is you're presenting out loud. So what I mean by animation is what if I wanted to tell a story about this plot,  I might first show The Pot tell the audience that we're looking at here are data from a game that we released mooville. I'm looking at active users over time through the looking between 2013 and 2015. We can see that upon release of Moonville. We had very few users, but that increased steadily over time for the rest of that year.  That increase once we started marketing game for the first half of 2014, but then blows didn't really increase over there and it just kind of steadily moved along. However, after complete rework of the game are users responded rapidly and are active users over time have really increased to the point that we will have over a hundred thousand users. I'm by the end of the year.  Okay. This is the way these animation to have people visually following what's going on notice. I know he's animation have things like spiraling in all over the place or things flashing those are distracting. But if you're using animation when you're presenting out loud to tell the story people understand your message rather than just showing them everything right up front.  However, if you are writing a report, you don't have the benefit of being able to walk people through a story. So but you do benefit from the fact that people have their own time to look at the information. So if you were to send that same information around you would not send seven different charts and have them look at each of them. You would put all the information on one piece of paper. They then can take the time to see what's happening over time. They see the same trend line, but they get the story that you told them directly on the grass. So it's important not to use the same visualisations for a live presentation that you would use in a report to your company or an email.  Really quickly toward the end of today. I want to know whether or not y'all think this is an explanatory plot and what this is telling us.  And if you think it's not a good visualization, what would you change?  Go to a few more seconds.  3 2 1  I pretty even split so who are the tell me what we're seeing here. I know that the the labels are a little bit small what we're seeing here what you should take away from this and whether or not you think this is a good explanatory visualization in a report.  Repairing a split with lots of different opinions.  I was Italian.  Why do you like it? Why do you not like it?  So there's some change in cost over time and the conclusion you John is at like materialistic things seem to be any cheaper but Necessities seem to be getting more expensive. I think that's a very good conclusion to draw from this. So what are things that have increased over time? So increase in price red is labeled as more expensive blue is label is more affordable and down here. We see stuff like clothing Furniture cell phone software toys and stuff that is getting way more expensive but kind of his really required in life often like housing and food and beverage. So this is another pot along with the Happy Valentine's Day pots for today showing that as time goes on this stuff is all getting way more expensive with regard to the visualization. Anybody want to tell me what they like or dislike. I know we're getting towards the end. It's just now  That's okay. Alright, I won't pull teeth here. So the reasons I like this on paper is there's a lot of information and it looks busy but I'll pay for your time to work through it. It's been helpfully colored that this is all blue. This is all red and makes clear that bread is more expensive Louis more affordable and it's not too busy. So you're able to look at the conclusion there.  Because I retired I will just do this one for you. So this is another one if you're interested in looking at climate change over time. This is an interactive visualization. So I just picked a quick snapshot that you can put in your hometown and your age and it will tell you overtime. How many days for the year will be over 90 degrees in the future using projections of climate change if there are Bunch we're not going to be the jupyter notebook until Tuesday. So I will see you all later. Have a great weekend.  I agree. I just admire I'm going to turn this off so I'm not protected. "
