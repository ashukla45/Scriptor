    "Full Transcript": "Are we going to get started?  Quite a few reminders as everybody gets settled. The second reading quiz is available on Triton Ed. It's due this Friday from here on out. You will have something to do every Friday before midnight on the first assignments also available. This is what you will be doing in groups. You'll have a chance in section if you haven't had sex in yet or you had a chance yesterday to get into those sections and start thinking about this assignment we can talk about details of the assignment where to find out how to do it and how to submit it at the end of today's lecture. The other thing section changes of all now been confirmed there is no more section switching again attendance isn't required infection, but you will be forming groups to do your sinus infection.  I never questioned that yesterday section. I know a few of you have questions on Piazza about the first reading quiz. So this was the distribution when I first took the grades off of training, so just to suffer because we hadn't talked about histograms yet. This is a histogram along the bottom. You see the possible Point numbers you could have gotten with tending the Max and then the y-axis are the number of people who received that grade so you can see most people did relatively well at first meeting with a 9 and the mean was 8.23 59 people who are on my Triton. I did not take this that's not a huge deal because your lowest reading score gets dropped as a reminder. So if you didn't do as well on this as you would have liked this may be the one that gets dropped.  So just briefly this is I just want you guys have some idea of how I look at these sorts. So this is a breakdown of the question. So it's on point of your previous you all have these on your place of using the five questions and then the possible score you could have gotten is on the y-axis. Remember when we had to do the matching there was a possible of six points there. This is a violin plot where I can see how many people fell into a certain spot but I mean by that is here I can tell right from the start that this was a question that was generally easier to the group because most people are up here getting full credit for that question. But what caught my eye was this one right here. This was the one where you had to fill in the free response X or Y and it says to me that some people got the point a lot of people got half credit and I suggested to me I had to go and look to see what people were saying and see whether or not other responses should have got him credit. So that's what I did.  This is it after I went in and Martha number of responses as correct. So if we look in Focus again in here before a lot of people didn't get full credit now many people got full credit on a question. So if you saw your grade before I did this it may have increased. Nobody's grades are going to decrease when I do this. So your grades are about what they are on there again, you can say If you think something was incorrect or marked wrong, but it's all auto graded your look great as likely what it is on blackboard on TriNet. So after that a lot more people got all the possible points an immediate the mean went up from a point to 28.5. If I do think this was the most difficult reading the second weeks are shorter, and I think the questions are a little easier so don't freak out if you didn't do as well as you wanted. Also if you filled out the survey you will get some extra credit. I haven't put that into traded yet so you can  It's actually in your mind add that to the score. It'll be at an extra two points on so if you got a 7 you can think of this as a 9 if you so shoes.  All right questions on reading quiz.  Okay, this is not a quick a Russian. This is reviewing what we talked about in the ethics lecture. So at the top you'll see so you don't need them yet. You will need them at some point if the data haven't really shared on the Internet is okay to use them for my data science or research project project. This is something we discussed in the last lecture and synthesis, of course about data. I want to use the data you guys provide me or collecting class and kind of show you guys information about you and your classmates for getting the plot to talk about on how you guys respond to this and I'll remind you you answered this initially in the course in the lecture did last time and then we talked about ethics and then you answer this for the end. This is a somewhat confusing plot. Some only showing part of it right now.  Why do you say I want to talk or are these are your initial response go up here? You had a few nurses at a b c d r e a reminder your score here is where strongly agree he's were strongly disagree strongly agree and you can see here how people who initially said a responded upon the second response. So you can see that a lot of people shifted towards the somewhat disagree or somewhat agree despite having strongly disagreed in the beginning.  on the other end of the spectrum  Not what I wanted.  So on the other end of the spectrum, these are people that strongly agreed in the beginning you can see that nobody went all the way to the other end and then chose a that's what's denoted by this little dash line appear.  However, the width of a column which we haven't talked about yet. It's how many people fell in each of the categories. So most people fell into these somewhat agree. So most even the course I thought that if it did happen fairly sure on the Internet, it's okay to use them for their project. We talked about the caveats of this last time. I'll just walk through the other two examples. Remember we talked about the Facebook study with the researchers from UCSF and Cornell and we talked about what does ethical and important hear the majority of people fell on the somewhat disagree side and we talked about the reasons for that are the jumps weren't as far as in the last one. So whatever your initial response you were close to that response at the end.  And that's how it is here. So most people who said in the beginning stuck with a most inclusive in the beginning stuck with E and their second response.  Blossom with the policing body should have access to genetic databases when attempting to identify a criminal here people overall felt the similarly to their first question and they somewhat agree here, but you can see that there was a fair amount of switching on this side of the spectrum.  Okay, that's review from last time any questions so far on what date of science is or ethics?  Okay. Today we're going to talk about this science part of data science. I'm going to touch on the scientific process when talking about reproducibility and replicability.  So these are data from the survey. So if you responded to the survey you are data are in here. The number of people are on the y-axis and the two topics will be discussing today on the x-axis. So if you were familiar with reproducibility or familiar with replicability here in this toolbar and you can see the vast majority of the class and these are not topics that they are very familiar with or things that they have thought about the time before and these are contracts that are really important today scientists. So we're going to discuss those today in definition and using examples.  Okay, so scientific method you probably have had this sometime in high school and another course you've taken here. And this is used when you do a data science project. So the first thing is you all live in the world You observe stuff all the time. So it's from his observations that we start forming questions. We start thinking about what we would like to understand more what questions we have what we don't understand well, so it's those observations that then form your question and you're coming up with data science questions to do your assignments after you come up with a question. You're going to do some background research what's already known is the answer this question? Cuz if it is you don't need to continue on do you believe that research if you don't then you may continue on and then you come up with a hypothesis, which is your best. Guess given what you found in your background research giving your observations in the world. What do you think the answer to that question doesn't matter whether or not you are right if your hypothesis is proven to be true or not proven to be true, but you come up with all the possibilities and start thinking about what you expect.  If you come up with your chest, then generate your experiment so biologists devise an experiment and carry it out from start to finish oftentimes on the experiment at date for data scientist has already been done for us the data exists in the world and we're going to use them then analyze a this is where the data scientist focus more is they have the data and then they use the data to answer the question and at the end you draw some conclusion that your hypothesis was, right? I was wrong for that. You still don't know which happens all the time and that's okay. You still learn stuff in the process?  I'm going to freeze over the slide. This is just talking about specifically for data scientist. What we think about it each part Savannah and focusing on the details of this one. This is just so you have it. I'm going to walk through a specific example that happened after a Twitter user observe something in the world. So this person here in the link to the food is here treat is from an iPhone and he's observing a nurse ingesting at made it to staff and every hyperbolic Street coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account comes from him and then he shows you some evidence and print it out to the world observation and then somebody did David Robinson who is a positive sign to set stack overflow with we'll talk about and is now a data scientist. I'm in here is a statistician by training he came up with this question who writes Trump's most hype about tweets. So there's this hypothesis that was tweeted out and he wanted to say  70 SQ example that he showed is this something we can conclude across all of Donald Trump's tweet.  Slippers thing he did minimal background research. This was a blog post. This is not a full research projects or this might not have the death of research that you would do for a full project background research as showed a article that suggested that Donald Trump. In fact tweets from a Samsung which support the hypothesis that the hyperbolic Suites presumably from Trump come from an Android phone. So that was a background research and then he needed to get the data. So dizzy up here is in a programming language called are I mentioned in this course, we're going to be using python. So I will not expect you to know any of the details of any of the programming are the codes that you see here. It's simply here to show you that there was code involved. So he is at 8, so he used this our package called quit are and that was how they got the most recent tweets from Donald Trump and thousands of them.  So from that account, he then analyze a data. So he first had to write some code to get the date and time format that he will use and we'll talk about data wrangling in a later lecture and then he generated figures to display the Roosevelt twin outfits. So I know it's kind of small up here, but the x-axis here is a ratio of Android to iPhone plus you so if you had more frequently on an Android in bed, if it were more frequently on an iPhone, it's in blue and it's split at zero and then the words on the y-axis here at the top. There are words like badly crazy week talking strong. So these are all more frequent from Android and then the ones that are more frequent from the iPhone or things like hashtag Trump America hashtag Maga hat haschak hashtag Trump 2016, which I think supports a little more that these are likely people who had access to the Twitter account. That may not be Trump himself.  In addition to generate figures. He also use text summarizing the findings in the results from the analysis.  Okay. So after you do this cool analysis and come up with this answer, it's really important as a data scientist that you communicate your results and there are lots of ways to communicate your results. In this case. It was a blog post which got picked up by lots of news outlets and for a short while David Robinson who says that he is not doesn't post about politics often and he's not all that Saturday about pulling that efficient. He is really supportive of the Davis Community, but he is not known for its politics previous to this got picked up by your answer to the question. Sometimes. It's the form of an academic Publications. Sometimes it's a report that you give to your boss on sometimes. It's a project that you do when your class and you share with others or just with your instructors respect. The knowledge is only really worth something if you share it with others in most cases.  Okay, so I gave you the sample we talked about Trump, please we show you that there are words that are more often found in Trump's tweets that come from iPhone relative to those that come from an iPhone to an Android versus an iPhone. But the first question I want to know is is this reproducible 3 to talk about a second what reproducibility means but I will open this one up.  Frequency code as a reminder is ad this will close in a few seconds.  how to close in a few seconds  3 2 1  all right smoothest to a place that's better. So most of it is or thinks that it is somewhat refer to school. So let's go to definition on us and we'll come back to this question.  Okay. So what defines reproducibility reproducibility something is reproducible. If you can re perform the same analysis with the same code for using a different analyst so the data are the same the color of the same result should be the exact same thing that the first and was found for that. You can find as a different analyst.  So in the bottles all the code weren't there, but they were all available and it was in a footnote. So to keep the closest ice David Robinson chose not to show all the code, especially those that generate the figures, but you can find them here. So I did that. This is a snapshot of the GitHub repo will talk about GitHub in the next lecture and he made all of the code available there. So when I was first getting besides together, I decided at 10:25 in the morning that I wanted to reproduce this and I got the code from GitHub. I then ran into an error and I looked at this error and there was something I really just want to run the code. So I commented out those widget lines and then 4 minutes after I had downloaded the code from GitHub. I had reproduced the  Entire blog post including the figures as they were seen in the blog post.  Okay. So with that said let's vote again.  I'm going to close it.  m321  Okay, so most people said yes, but they're still a few people things somewhat. Does anybody who said someone when they explain their thinking there?  Anybody didn't say somewhat have an idea as to why someone might think this is not reproducible.  It might be someone trying to recreate this data analysis will take me back to my house and he hears that they might come up with a different result. If they didn't take the exact same steps. I'm going to have you hold on to that thought for the next part when we start talking about replicability the reproducibility here with the same code and the same data should come up with the exact same result. And I guess the question here is did I come up with the exact same result?  Samosa you say yes, I would love actually say yes, but I did run into that first error and we're going to talk about errors that can occur when you're trying to reproduce in analysis such as software version issues with we'll get to that already limit to reproducibility. So here I had a pretty easy time and I would say this is about as easy as it gets when you're trying to look at someone else's work and redo what they did. It's not always as easy or disorganized.  Okay. So here we have a whole laundry list of why I study a project blog post would fail to be reproducible. So the simplest have to do with the data if you're not if the data aren't shared publicly or they're provided in a different format than what was actually use or say they deleted observations and then put it on the internet and you try to do then use their code to run the same analysis. You're not going to get the same numbers at the end the Arena Theater or not provided in that can be due to privacy. So maybe the date of can't be sure because there are personally identifiable information on there, but you wouldn't be able to reproduce the result. If they don't share their date code missing or not included is often a problem in academic journals more and more they're being asked to share this but if not across the board.  Put documentation. So I want to harp on this a little bit. I'm documenting your code for documenting. Your projects is not the most fun part of your project. So you're like one answer this question. You have it. They start doing a bunch of things and then you 6 months from now or anybody else in the world trying to understand what it is. You did will not be able to understand what you did unless you document your profile. So you include note. Everything is in software. You don't often engineering software generating tools documentation is always really appreciate it, but it doesn't always get you credit. So it's good to document but you don't always get and there aren't any incentives to document things. Well, so same thing goes here in a data science project. It's important to make sure you in the future or anybody else is able to understand them.  I mentioned so method lacking a publication that is a issue in academic journals is so somebody does this analysis and it's really cool and really in-depth and then a few months after they actually do it. They try to go back and write about what they did and they leave out that unintentionally like their intense are not their intentions are not bad. So it's really important to keep good notes as you go to make sure while you're doing it you're documenting everything so that when you publish or when you share your information everything's there and can you share it accurately software version issues. This happens a lot using python or R and that things change over time and if you're not using the exact same version of the person who did the analysis initially was using I'm you could run into problems trying to reproduce with somebody else did.  Unfamiliarity with available tools if you're not sure how to get the tool working or you're not sure exactly what it's doing that can lie to you failing to reproduce it. Somebody else did and that's not a problem with what the first person did. It's just that you are unfamiliar with the tools that are out there the last few I've hinted on already. I'm a little bit for the desired work quickly you're excited when I get things done quickly and that can force you to drop the ball in any of these other things we talked about so it's good to slow down and think about what you're doing make sure doing it in a way that somebody else will also be able to reproduce results.  Where can I find if I mention on generating software or generating analyses? You don't really get credit for how well it's documented often or how easy it is for somebody else to do when you get credit for it working or generate more revenue or for answering the question, but it is really important to take a step back and make sure your work is reproducible. The last one is anxiety a sharing code and if you're new to programming and somebody says you should make all of your code public. That's a scary thought and you were like, I'm not really good at this yet. And we're going to talk to you about get hug next lecture. We're not going to be using GitHub in his course, but I'd imagine you use it in court is going forward, but I think you can take solace in is that most people are going to look at your code, but if you want to or usually doing it for a good purpose, they're generally trying to learn something from it. They decided that your clothes not go to know what they want. They just won't use it and that's okay. So it's there for people who want to use it. So try to know that most people are in the right place when they're looking at your code.  Any questions on these reasons why a study with Valerie reproducible?  Okay, there are lots of them. I just want to harp on the fact that it's your responsibility to address all of them. It's good to know what can go wrong and just throw it in the beginning document as you go make sure things are clear make sure that you understand what you're doing and that future you will also be able to understand what you're doing.  Okay, historically there lots of reasons why we haven't been reproducible and we'll talk about them in chunks of the middle one Daily Republic code not requiring peer review of code and lack of transparency in the reviewing a paper. So this is why things that are published tend to not be reproducible. We just haven't forced it. We haven't given people a reason to do so that's changing and I hope to see a change even more in the future and the other two reasons here. We talked about the antenna for fun at the bottom of the lack of statistical literacy or lack of computational literacy as a data scientist or General in science. We have a niche that we understand and we don't know everything about everything and that's okay, but it's important that we have a science education and effective communication to improve you so that when we talked to others were improving other statistical literacy their computational literacy, we need to be able to explain what we need to be able to explain why we took the approaches that we did in their analysis.  MSN news stations being required Sharon code is easy. We're going to talk about how to do that in the next lecture and advancement in technology have really allowed for this reproducible culture to take hold. So in Python, when are there going to push jupyter notebooks and their counterpart rmarkdown? Notebooks are game-changers. They make a really easy. We're going to be using these for your projects that will talk and your time is so we'll talk about this at the end of software version issues. You don't need to know anything about this, but I started to make that easier make software version issues less of a problem.  any questions about reproducibility  Okay, reproducibility. Same data same code same exact answers at the end. That's a different analyst.  I just by a show of hands who has heard of the replicability crisis.  Okay, we have a few people not most of us. So we'll see when a second Wi-Fi reproducibility crossed out.  So every couple years and this one is from last year end of 2018.  Are Publications both in the New York Times and in scientific journals that have the steepest the experiments are fascinating, but nobody can refute them. So it is there's this literature. There's a spotty of research. We have his conclusion to be drawn these things. We think we know about the world and then somebody tries to go redo what somebody else did and they run into a problem. So when a an experiment fails to be able to be redone that is a failure of replication  So this is not a new thing that we talked about. This is home from 2005. So a few years ago at this is from 7 until 9. I'm going to suggest that he's somewhat of a provocateur. He likes to provoke. He likes to question which is a good thing but there are ways to do it and his are not always the most constructive but in this he wrote this obviously strongly-worded title, why most published research findings are. There in 25 and 2005 is that it can be proven that most claim research findings or false.  Set of arguing that there are a number of drawbacks to this essay. So we won't really called a research paper. It's based on conjecture and simulations was not based on real attempts at replicating previously published by Nick.  But there are some ideas in here that are worthwhile and I think the most worthwhile idea is the fact that to determine whether or not I study replicated we have to try to replicate it. So their number of attempts have been made it this so this one's from 2014 and it was published in social social psychology. These are looking at social science studies and they investigated variation in Rebels bility and they found that 10 of the 13 classic effect did rapid gate. So the issue here is that they were trying to replicate a sex but not whole studies. So I mean by that is there any police in the social sciences easy things that they accept as an effect the one example is that if you are given a number  And asked to estimate another number they anchor based on what that first number was which could be while the offer what they're asking as tomato. If you're at the estimate the number of people who live in New York City and they give you a number that either way to bigger way too small and then ask you to estimate based on an anchor. There's an effect called angry about how close you will be to that. First number. Is it a fact that they didn't do the experiment the exact same way necessarily as the first study was done to find us a fact that said they did sample across many different laughs so They Carried is out in lots of different places. So each. Represents a different study. So if we just woke us up here on this line This is that anchoring effect that I just talked about there a few different things that they ask people estimate the X indicates what the effect size was in that initial publication. So if you're off to the right and these other studies, so these are all the different labs and then the effect that is in the middle that is that Circle so saying when they reproduce  Get it, all of these experiments. The effect was even bigger than what was initially published.  If there is no difference in the new replications, you'll be somewhere near zero. Please ones that cost zero down here do not replicate. So when is Flag priming so fly framing is something I did not replicate and it's the idea that if you show images to a room of people or two people on a computer screen and you show the American flag in their the initial publication said that those individuals then go on to have more conservative views in the question. Are you ask them afterwards those initial study and the effect was over here, so it wasn't a huge effect, but they said there was an effect when they went to us and said Douglas replicate they didn't find that fly priming was something that could replicate.  The number of these are economical so sunk costs is the idea that you bought a ticket to a football game. And then when that day comes around is blistering cold out and you decide that you don't want to go anymore. And the idea here is our people more likely to opt not to go if they pay for the ticket vs. If they didn't put the bill for the ticket and it finds that if you paid for it, you're more likely to go. So that's what's don't cost that is happy to chat about any of these people questions here is the number of glass and can be pretty confident that these effects exist now that they replicated in the number of different places.  This is just up here. And if you got the Flies early, they just won't be in your side that goes up there. Now. This is a talk. I'll be on campus. The IAT is an implicit association test made largely Famous by this woman who wrote a book called the blank blank, which I heard her speak a few years ago and then got this book after an awesome book that she will be on campus in a week or so.  Okay flowers and her Run results were replicated in that previous fly that I showed. The other one was evaluating the replicability of social science experiments and Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015 season results from their study and it's shown in a similar way as to the previous paper. If you cross zero you are colored yellow ons an affair affect replicates you were in blue. So large number of these studies replicated and almost half of them did not  This was picked up by The Washington Post and here it is having the number X when it's reported out. It's reported out as of reproducibility Crisis that really they're talking about replicability. Can we replicate with somebody else already found by generating new data?  So we're talking about replication. It's Reba form an experiment and collecting new data.  Okay to record ability is harder than reproducibility because by definition the underlying data are different and data are variable. So if you go measure people's feelings about broccoli and you ask them four times throughout the year on a scale of 1 to 10 how much later they like broccoli. You're probably not going to get the exact same answer every time just like the fact that they probably like broccoli just as much of the beginning of the year at the end of the year the same goes for measurements you take in a lab sometimes instruments are more sensitive when it's more humid out in less than 1 is less humid out and if you don't take that into account the numbers even though you're measuring the same thing on the same machine on different days are going to be a little bit different.  So if you're trying to replicate an entire experiment and you have to redo what somebody else did generate an entirely new set of data and then carry out the analysis, hopefully in the exact same way. They did back a lot harder than taking data that exists taking code that exists and seeing if you get the same answer.  Okay, so far this we're going to do a brief. Experimental ask you guys in a question and a few clicker questions about this is Imagine about the plants. You have the special growth compound and increases the yield of you're really awesome plant by 50% relative to plants grow in without your special throat compound.  Okay, so you probably insist and tell me the time on my plants to be a lot bigger. I'm going to go do what they did and one group says okay. We don't need to redo everything. We're just going to take their day to take their coat and see if we get the same finding another group says I roll we could do that. But why don't we see if it actually works in our system. We have his plans we had we can get this growth compound. Let's see if we see the same effect that they saw in the first study.  Okay, because you're a great day scientist, you made all of your data and code public and then within an hour or so, the first group has completely reproduce the results. They found that they got the same thing that you did.  I got to hand the group that put out to replicate your findings. They generate their data. So that takes them a few months to grow the plants and measure whether or not they grew at a higher rate and they found that you were super awesome girls compound increase growth by 10%  sew-in initials permit growth is increased by 50% in the replication growth increased by 10% So does this count as replication?  Piranha say are you guys is registering equipped yet?  Man, that's supposed to be.  Okay, they're clicking in.  I'm going to close it in 3 2 1.  Okay, we can put his foot and I think this is reasonable. So people who said know why are we saying? No.  Who sings that this did not replicate?  What were your thought process there?  I think so either answer is reasonable.  I didn't think of that located. What was what when is your thought process there is to white as snow replicate.  I will come back to your house. Who said yes, and why do they say that?  I am going to give you 30 seconds a minute talk to your neighbor and see why I discuss why you came up that answer.  All right.  We'll come back and answer.  Okay, regardless of what you said the first time now that you guys have discussed it who wants to defend their position? Yes or no?  Yes.  Okay the results cuz the actual number is so different. So 50 and 10 are not the same number. So they're too far apart to say that the results replicated.  Who are you for? Yes, yes.  Okay replicated the results are different but not so far different that you would say that we didn't have the same conclusion that we would draw from it. Anybody else have an opinion they want to argue?  Okay, sweetheart. There's that replication has to do with reproducing that we're sorry doing what somebody else had previously done and getting similar results and it does not have the results are somewhat similar. So we're staying here that 50 and 10% are close enough. This is a point. I want to make about the reaction of effect and measurement and will conclude in a few more will do another one. How about in this case?  Initial sermon growth is increased by 50% in the replication growth increased by 49% Let's see here what we all say.  I'm going to close it and 3.  2 1  okay. So here we have the majority of people saying that this replicated so we're now on the base before we now think that 49 is close enough to 50. So even though it's not exactly 15. The exact thing that I got before they both increase and if I had a similar amount.  Okay. So the point I went to make here is about direction of effect and actual value. So it's easier to use the directional effect by Me by Direction affect is both increased or both decrease. So both results in the original experiment and the replication on increase. They both have the same direction of effect. But in our first example we didn't have the same value for the estimate is what we call and statistics is different between the two experiments.  So we're talking about replicability values do not have to be the exact same but they have to be obtained with the state of precision in the first experiment and I didn't give you that in the first plant example, which was so that we could have a discussion about them know how precise that 50% wasn't a first experiment if they said we increased by 50% but there was a became ten times more we wouldn't be so confident that it was exactly 50% increase growth if the initial experiment all the plants grew the exact same amount increased by exactly 50% CD pretty sure that that was the value so we would be expecting the replication to have a value much closer to 50% then in that first example where they're all over the place.  questions on that  so you have to in the first experiment give and how confident you are in that value send the replication. You would expect to be within that same range.  The director of a sack matters and how close you are to the original estimate matters?  Okay that we talked about and reproducibility why you might not have something be reproducible. Let's talk about why something might fail to replicate.  So the first one could be that the finding without real or the effect was small. So I mean by that is if you have plants and then your growth compound increases by a tiny little bit they 1% smallest acts that may not be measurable. If somebody else does it despite the fact that you did see this 1% increase close if they do the experiment in the exact same way that you did in the same place using the same. They should be able to measure that but it might be to be a small fact or it wasn't real in the first place. There was something flawed about the initial experiment and they shouldn't have reported any real finding initial.  Measurement error we talked about that measurement of height commence differ if I have a slightly different stick if I had something some uneven ground measurement from machine can be different about temperature or humidity under lots of things that contribute to error in measuring and you would never want to report out a finding base on error, but it happened population. What if you thought you were using the same exact plant that I use in my experiment but you happen to have a slightly different variation of the same species that would cause a problem and maybe it's not as effective gross compound the type of plant you have different experimental design or conditions you of course when you set out to replicate a study want to use the exact same conditions and design that were used in the first experiment and the first analysis, but sometimes they're not made that clear. Sometimes you think you're doing what you're supposed to do in but they are in fact different so that can lead to fill replication.  when I question  definition of failed to replicate is that first the director of fact was different. So if you saw an increase the floor and you saw a decrease before is one of the other half is that your value that you you saw was within the range expected from that first experiment. So you have to be in the same direction and then within that same direction you need to be within these dated error from the first experiment.  Good question.  Okay, like reproducibility you want to be as careful as you can in any analysis you do you wouldn't want error or variability to Beauty results that said we're going to talk about cases on either side of spectrum here today. But say you repeat somebody else's work and you find something that's different than what they found. It's our gut instinct to think that we are right that we did it the right way, but that's always the case so they could have done something wrong or you could have done something wrong and you have to do your due diligence to figure out which it is.  Okay, these are from the I say they have specific definitions. This is what we talked about. This is just to summarize it so you had it in your notes.  Okay, we're going to use a few examples on to really make sure we understand reproducibility and replicability use a stem cell example something to tell you for this purpose. All you need to know about stem cells are cells are in your body that when you form an embryo go on to become all the cells that are in an adult body. So there's this set of cells and they can go on to become a muscle cell or a blood cell or neuron, but there's a population that starts creating them. All the definition of the stem cell is that they have to be able to create all of the possible tissue and cells in the body questions on that very brief definition.  Okay, so I'm a radius and then open it up in a second. So your goal without any prior knowledge is to think which of these do you think fails to replicate another way to think of this as which of these sounds be crazy to you? The one that your skin cells can be turned. So that sells like I take something from your skin can be turned into stem cell like Bells by hang on a dish just like a plastic petri dish with a few other transcription factors five of them will say you don't need to know what a transcription factor is to decide on this the second genome. So the tcsg is an ace in your DNA there and all of yourself to be edited by co-opting the system bacteria used to remember viruses. They've encountered  The third one similar to start on your skin cells can be turned into stem cell. Like they'll to make me turn back into these things that go on to make all your other self by putting them in a dish and exposing them to low PH to something. That's more acidic or Digimon can be edited using the crisper cast 9 system.  The open this up.  Which of these do you think fails to replicate?  Guthrie talk to each other.  I'm a closet.  m321  Okay, so the results so you can see all the options.  It's pretty evenly split aside from Dee's having the most realistic which I agree that sounds the most realistic and we didn't even talk about what that is, but the answer isn't a second the example should make it clear but I included because I kind of think they all sound unreasonable and we'll talk about that as we go and welcome back to the answer in a second.  Okay, so I mentioned that you have a stem cells and an embryo and I go on to form of the South your body. That's true there these things called ipsd zoraya induced pluripotent stem cells. So this is the case that I mentioned in the beginning in the first 5 where I take a skin cell from you. I put it in a dish I add 5 things to it and I'm making this a little simpler than it is, but it's still pretty simple and these can go on to create those in any of the three germ layers. You don't need to know what those are. Those are the three arrows tour the bottom of the cell cycle want to make all of the cells in your body.  So it is true that I can take a skin cell from you mix it with some stuff in a dish and then I can take what was previously a skin cell and make it look like a neuron. That's a real thing.  This was published in 2014 in January and it was this pretty easy to understand title, which is not always the case for scientific journals Acid Bath offers easy pasta themselves. So they argue we can take your skin so we can put on Dish we can lower the ph make it more acidic and then we can still go on to create all of these different types of self.  34 known as stem cells instead of iPic so stimulus triggered acquisition for diplomacy.  A month later, it was important at the internal acid-fast Dental study under investigation people in the field. Like this doesn't sound believable. They looked at the paper. They said you you either think you have these capsules or you're just lying but you can't just say so but he's lying you have to then try to replicate and study and 17th in four different countries try to replicate the procedure and the teams working on to a hundred and thirty three different times to produce these that sells all of which failed and that was by September of 2015. So this publication comes out and says there's an easier way to create these cells and you just need to lower the ph so the initial lab for what we understand to this point. They really thought they had created stab self. We don't yet know exactly what went wrong. Why do they have some contamination and they really just had what I was talking about before we can take them skin cells you can add by factors do it. Those are called the yamanaka factors.  Chimney, yamanaka figured out how to do this on the one that does work. We can take skin cells make IPS be back on in Iran, and he won the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this just followed up staying it's even easier than that. So that first one was true. You can take skin tells you can add some factors and you can differentiate into the wrong but the low acid one was not true.  So what scientific Community quickly identified either contamination or figure issues that they just made up their work or Star mental issues? And it looks like they were probably all of them that they filled with their figures in the paper that they also happen contamination and they also likely had something where they knew that what they were putting out into the world is not true. So you can not replicate this study just like women to pee system D&D or actually the same thing the crisper cast nine system come from bacteria to tell they remember what viruses they found you don't even know any of that but it's cool stuff if you want to look into it more. Okay. So this is not an actual test that exist in the world, but it's something that I was told as a graduate student. I think it's important to remember  So if it looks like a unicorn it probably is unicorn. So if you find a result, that is so gangbuster that it changes all of your previous thinking there's a chance that's real but it's your job to go figure out if it's actually a unicorn see if they do tons of follow-up to figure out that it really is a unicorn. So my argument here is a staff sells those were unicorn. They said she was a simple thing that nobody else around the world owes. You can put them in an acid bath and suddenly we have these cells that can go on to create everything else that looks like a unicorn that's something super cool if it exists, but it's your job to make sure you have to go try to redo your experiments and replicate your fine before the world. That's what I call the Unicorn test. If it looks like unicorn it probably is a unicorn and it's your job to make sure I convince yourself that the effect is real.  Okay, that's one and we're going to talk about the other right now. So there's this famous experiment is millikan's oil drop experiment and the goal here with to measure the charge of an electron who did this time by using these oil drop set up the details are important the milk and came up with this number in the early 1900s and the y-axis or Coulomb's again. You don't even know these numbers. You don't need to know what that is. The point is the overtime others try to do this experiment and they use the following oil drops and may we now know that what he initially estimated was not the right number.  The reason was because of the incorrect value for the viscosity of air whose measurements were off by a little just because he had assumed this number with something other than what it was.  So other people try to redo his experiment.  And we saw this interesting effect. So if you look over time.  There was an overtime increase in what we thought was a number and then it kind of flattened out as what is the true charge of an electron.  And the thing that happened here is that people believe milliken's number and when they sell data that went contrary to what was already published. They thought no, I can't be right military show that that's his number. It has to be right and it took a lot of time like 40 years to realize. Nope. He had it wrong and we've had evidence in here that showed us that if he was wrong but wouldn't believe it yet. So I didn't know if this number was wrong immediately because people thought that something was wrong so they try to look for a reason why there are data were wrong, what's wrong or they didn't look so hard. I just didn't want to find out they eliminate numbers that were too far off. So they fudge their data a little bit to come up with a number that Milliken have previously reported.  And this is not his confirmation bias. So we have some expectation of what we think the truth is so they thought milliken's number was truth and then we get rid of anything. We see contrary to that belief. So we try we tend to interpret favor macaw information in a way that confirms or pre-existing Feliz or hypothesis.  the confirmation bias  and that was a weird guilty of as a society in rejecting the true number for the charge of electron by believing that millikan's number had to be right.  Subordinate is there's a lot of bouncing to be done in every step of an analysis and it's your job to balance between unicorns. So believing things that are too good to be true and relying too heavily on expectation. And there's a happy medium in there. Neither is good. So you want to meet somewhere in the middle. You don't want to fall for unicorns or you don't want to deny things that are real just because you have some expectation another example of confirmation bias comes from biology world where a lot of people do math experiments and they put them in these boxes and a Mouse runs around of a measure of some sort of behavior. It's very common for people to go inside a garment if they see what they expect they say up. Okay, we have evidence to what we think but if they don't see what they were expecting Geico will the mice were variable and we didn't have this condition rent in a repeat the experiment really the number of times are going to do the experiment should be dead before you go into the box and see the results. So if you have a plan ahead of time you can start to fight against confirmation bias.  Okay. So which of the following is an example of confirmation bias? I'm going to give you time to read it and then you can decide.  I'm going to close it in 5 seconds.  3 2  1  Okay, so this is probably the most unbalanced we've had so far and I think it has to do with the fact that I didn't read them and I put it as a so I was right it's the only support your candidate and ignoring reports that do not it's goes on to confirm the biases you already had better than seeing the whole picture.  Songs of the second most frequent was coming to an estimate after being presented one. That is way too long a large. That was a tank ring that I talked about earlier. So it's not confirmation bias.  Okay.  I had I'm going to go into detail about assignments before moving to that. Does anybody have questions about reproducibility replicability confirmation bias or what? I'm calling the Unicorn test.  I want to go into details so that you have these you can look back at these anytime you're submitting an assignment. It will be the same process. So this is available on train dead. Now, there is a notebook that has your first assignment in it. This is how we will deliver each assignment to you. They what it is a template where you will write all of your answers as a group and then you will submit a pdf version of it. So the steps are there generally and I'll always be there. Generally. I'm really specifically when you click on that link. You're likely not going to open it up right away. Unless you have previously used collaboratory. So for those of you who have which is not many of you home, if you own the survey said you did this is a version of a jupyter notebook, but it's in the Google version. So it's like a Google Drive project, but it allows you to run code and write text in the same document. So yours will probably say like suggested app down here. You will then click on collaboratory and you must use your ucsd.edu account to access it.  Okay. See you click that. You want to use the collaboratory? I'm at and only one person in your group has to do this first step. So they will open it up and you will not be able to edit the first document you see but they will be instructions in blue. We'll talk about the rest of the document a second the first thing that first person in your group does and they should save a copy and drive. That's the one that you're going to edit.  And then you probably want to set up a drive folder so that all of the assignments and the final project are all in one place for your tire group and just give everybody edit rights on that pole drive folder.  Okay, then you're going to go in and get that first person who creates the first copy is going to enter all of the group's UCSD email addresses here and make sure that everybody can edit the document. This will allow you to all collaborate work on at the same time and see what other people are doing. It should make  Working on it together easy and we'll make it ultimately easier on your teeth and eyes when they're grading which is definitely something you want cuz you want them to be good mousse when they grade, okay this week the goal is to think of topics and questions you have are there any determine whether or not their data sets out in the wild that you can use to answer that question. So very briefly when you enter your information into these documents will always be in the cells that are black. So you'll have an example above they'll be some instructions in blue. So here you would double click in the document as your team members your team name and your section number so the places where you expected to write answers are at the section that has Type in Black.  Okay, generally, this is how it's going to work. The first one is coming up with a question finding some date of that may work and considering what ethical considerations you have to make to answer this question. The next one will be data wrangling. This will involve programming will have practice infection will talk about it in class. The third is data visualization these two middle. So the only to where there's programming required the last one is a proposal of analysis doing the analysis are doing any steps in the analysis is an option for extra credit on the final project. You are not required to do the analysis. You're only require to propose how you would do the analysis in detail?  So it should be pretty easy on you. When you get to the final project. You'll have time to feed back each time. You'll have Incorporated that feedback each week from your cheese and ice and then you'll put it all together. You'll add an introduction and conclusion will be guided through all of this. But the final project should just be putting these together at an introduction in the conclusion and incorporating any other feedback and edit you have questions on how that will work generally.  Becky Tanya Mathias Hines questions. I hadn't specified what your question needs to be and varsity cuz it can be whatever you want. I want to do something you care about so you actually want to find the data and want to answer this question. So an example here is if you and your group get together and you're like what we're all really interested in sports and maybe baseball in particular. You don't start thinking of questions you have about the sport and it doesn't have to be a groundbreaking question has to be something you're interested in doing. So to general question would be and look what makes baseball popular. That's something that's a hard question to answer with Jaden when it's that General Tso a slightly more specific question would be has baseball become less popular in the post steroid era for those you have cracked down on steroids has change the game a little bit and you might think that I would have a popularity. We don't really know here how we're going to measure popular.  So a good data science question here would be has viewership. So maybe people are viewing on TV of the MLB Major League Baseball decreased in the posterior Adara. Now, we know what we're going to look at you have a year add a timer to look before and after were going to measure viewership or you can look at attendance at stadiums and determine if that has decreased in poster Adara. So the idea of what you want to do, you know what you're looking for, then you can go find a dentist that will talk on a second about where to find it at that but there are other questions that we've talked about in this lecture and the previous ones that you could use to chart thinking about what a good question is. If you have a little bit of time clock shop is a data science class that I think was at SUNY. So it's a New York and awesome instructor did this course where he had people make videos from start to finish of their data science projects that he gave them the ideas for the question and then it's a 30 minute for each of the episodes on how they did the analysis and what they had to think about. So if you're confused you can look there the questions are listed or you can watch the episodes.  Are you trying with classmates are come to section or office hours to discuss this?  These are just so you have links in and out of places. You can look for data sets. You are not limited to these. In fact, they did. Gov when will the shutdown so that will not be accessible right now, but maybe we'll be tomorrow probably not but there are archives you can find the data tomorrow. You can collect your own data. There's one caveat that you need to have at least 50 observation. So you have to get information from at least 50 people. If you want to collect your data, you can also use data to say you work with a group you've collected some data that the world doesn't have access to but you do you are free to use that as long as you have permission to use them in this course and can share it with the group members of your group.  questions on data  Okay, I mentioned there are a few requirements. We're going to talk about what a continuous variable in a categorical variable is into xers a continuous variable is a number like height something that can measure using a number and a categorical variable in my example would be like major league baseball team named there's some limit as the total numbers. You're either the Houston Astros or your the Philadelphia Phillies, you might also want to collect other information. You'd want to know what the weather was the years of the same as the other things that might affect popularity to start thinking about what information you would need to answer your question.  What the end does it important?  You're going to have to submit a PDF on gradescope in here. There will not be an option that says David B PDF you have to use the print option and when you go to print if this does not say save as PDF Quick Change save as PDF will be an option here and that will allow you to save as a PDF PDF is what you will submit on gradescope and we will use a rubric to mark your documents.  Make sure that all of the gradescope worries are out before right when this is due. So make sure you have access to this. You should all have access on gradescope and only one member of your group must admit it but you must add all the other members of your group to the submission. If you don't know how to do that, there are links down here showing you how to do that. Most of you in the class have previously used gradescope. So if you are in this group, that is okay, but feel free to ask infection. Feel free to talk to one of your classmates as they can probably help you out.  Are any questions? Yeah one of the back.  Every question to the question is if you have a discussion section on Friday, what do you do? This is not due until next Friday and you'll time to work on it this Friday infection. So you will have time to work with your group until next Friday the great question. "
