    "Full Transcript": "As people get settled we'll get started. I have an announcement up here from one of your fellow classmates. There is a business rebooted conference this Saturday and it's open to everybody. So this light is online. If you want to see more information, you can see the link to RSVP here. I'm so if you're interested in a business conference this Saturday take a look at this.  Second you have your set a timer to do tomorrow. We're going to spend a little bit of time today talking about submitting that because they're having some issues with the collaboratory notebook, which is good to know and V reading is due next week in here and make sure that if your team is having trouble submitting PDX that look good from York laboratory notebook. So, you know have the data and I have your images if you're struggling to do that. We have a solution so you can submit the link directly to your laboratory notebook. So like sharing in Google Drive, if you go up to the top right of your notebook and try to share it what I'm saying is don't just copy this go down here make sure that you have anyone with the link can view and then copy this link once you have selected anyone can do if you don't see that option click more. So make sure that if you want to share your notebook with your greater that you have made it viewable to anyone.  By the way, you're going to share it is at the top of your notebook. So add a cell at the top of your laboratory. Notebook that says please greater sign in using the following link the way you add a hyperlink in marked down as we talked about before is you have something that you want to display between square brackets and then the link in parentheses after it. It'll look like this.  I'll be at the top of your PDF. So you will still save a PDF you will submit the PDF to gradescope that will be a backup in case you don't submit the link correctly. The last thing you want is just another link that nobody can read it and then you don't get a grade on your project. So address to the top of your project if you want somebody to use the link to grade your project or your assignment. This is what the top of your assignment will then look like and then you'll like this as part of the first response on gradescope. They will know to look at it. So any questions if you want to submit your linked directly rather than the PDF you can do that. You have to add the link that anyone can do to the top of your Clapper Tori notebook. It should look something like this and then you will select this page as part of the response to the first question on gradescope. So you're greater knows that you're using the link rather than the media.  any questions  if the link does not work, we will grade 2 PDF instead.  All right, so long as you know, you have to be there today. So if you are here I'm take out your iclicker. I have to open it up one second. Sorry.  training  Yeah, no problem.  Okay, we're going to go to Sadie.  If you were here.  How to make sure it's clipped in sorry because of that double check that your response has been recorded.  I got a few more seconds on this.  It's still open. You can still kick in if you're still getting your clicker out. So if you are just driving and you want to get credit for being here today, push any button a three on your clicker Avatar editor regrets. Their seats around as people are filtering in today. We're very fortunate to have a senior data scientist from the area who works at Classy to talk to you all today. I'm not going to talk a lot about her story cuz she's going to tell you about how she became a data scientist some of the work. She's done as a data scientist and what you all I can think about as you start to be come and interested in data science careers. So feel free to think of questions, they'll be time at the end to ask questions. So with that I would like to introduce page p giannini and we'll get her set up.  15 seconds  NOW Watch Me Whip  Everybody hear me. Okay, I'll take that as a yes, sir. My name is Paige piccininni. I'm going to talk to you today about that. I'm calling practice to production my journey and science. So since we're going to go over today just quickly so I'll talk a bit about my background. So kind of the general trajectory of where I started how I got to where I am now working at a company as a data scientist.  I'll talk a little bit about what is data science job. Looks like at least in my particular case, go through a couple of case studies of problems. We've approached in my job and see you guys think about them and how we might have do it differently in the future. And then finally, I'll talk about a bit about how to get a job in data science and I didn't want to be out there that this is my personal experience in my recommendations. You may have heard her things and you made her things in the future that differ to my hope is just to give you another perspective on ways in which you can approach getting a job in data science.  So starting with some information on my background. So in 2006, I had my first experience doing any programming the language that I first program is called Trot just probably one that most of you have not heard of unless you took a language Linguistics class. So it's basically a language where you can analyze human speech. It is very finicky. It is not something you have to have in your data science tool belt, but it was my first exposure to any kind of coating.  In 2008. I took my first Physics course where I learn are and so I bought some more experience and more classical type data science programming.  In 2009, I graduated with my mava in linguistics where I focused on human speech analysis.  In 2010, I decided to start a PhD actually here at UCSD also in linguistics.  Eminem 2016 I graduated with my PhD  Note this is no longer to scale. So we really strung together those PhD years, even though a lot of stuff didn't happen. And I also started a postdoc in 2016 where I work with people who had Huntington's disease and try to be able to build models to predict disease severity from speech patterns. So Huntington's disease for people who don't know it's a neurodegenerative disease people have both on muscle control problems and lose ability to do things like speak over time as well as have different anger and other types of mood swings sweet riding use speech patterns to figure out where someone was in the progression of their disease.  I despite spending quite a bit of time and I could be Mia in 2017. I left Academia to get a job as a data scientist at Classy. So for classy basically the best description I've heard what they do is WordPress for nonprofits. So basically nonprofits will pay classy a monthly subscription fee where they'll have access to a suite of products to build out things like donation Pages or hold events where people can come and support their nonprofit. So in addition to having these Pages, there is also inherently Commerce company. So my job is a data scientist, which I get into more in a moment is a lot of analyzing these transactional information around donations to understand donor behavior and just general Trends in a non-profit space.  And then finally 2019. I'm back here at UCSD with all of you talking about how I got from a very idiosyncratic programming language all the way to being a guest lecture.  So I think when people give these talks this tends to be the trajectory. They usually talk about they'll mention their first or second programming language. They'll go over their academic history and then probably whatever their career history was as well, but there's a lot of things that I learned a lot of tools I picked up as well that aren't necessarily on here. So during my undergrad year is I learned a lot about experimental design and how to build a clean experiments that can answer really specific hypotheses.  In my PhD, I'll get got more of a background in statistics and machine learning which is really important for analyzing results and also building models. I also picked up some other languages. So I learn Python and when I was transitioning to Industry, I spent a lot of time trying to learn SQL and during my first year on the job in data science, but a lot of time practicing SQL learning how to write SQL queries. I also did some community outreach work. So I started a chapter of our lady's so our lady's is a global meetup group for women who like to program in language are I started the chapter where I was doing my post off?  And when I move back to San Diego, I also start a chapter here in San Diego. So if anyone would like to come you should definitely come to our ladies. It's a great proof.  MN addition to doing these things. I did some other personal development type work. I made a more robust website and more geared towards industry. I wrote up some blood post and projects. I worked on the side. I also built out and open source our course that anyone can look at and then another side project that I will show you more details up later my friends and I during my post-doc decided to make a Kickstarter around proper data visualization practices, which was mostly a joke, but also kind of serious with that throughout this path. There's a whole bunch of things that I learned and picked up and did besides just the standard course of I learn a programming language. I went to school and I got a job and became really important for me when I did eventually go on the job market and then also in my current job as well.  I so want to talk about now about what a date in state of science job actually looks like  with my caveat that this is one person's experience. So probably no data science can be a really broad term and it can mean a lot of different things to different people in two different jobs and depending on the industry or the particular company. They can have different needs for what a data scientist can do at that company and you can even change over time as a company close and their needs shifts what they need from a data science team can also change so I want to talk about some of my experiences in this last Almost 2 years that I've been a classy but just want to point out that if this difference from things you've heard that makes sense. Lee reach out to others as well out here with their experience with data Sciences.  I just want to go over a couple of different case studies all focusing on the topic of recurring donors. So we sleep for a little bit of reference of what this is. If you go to a donation page for a non-profit you decide I really like this nonprofit. I want to be able to give them some money my money you can go to the page click a button and give that one time donation. And so we call this a one-time donor someone who made that one-time transaction. They might come back in the future if you don't really know for sure nothing's guaranteed.  Come over. The other option is that when they go to that page they can click a button and say that they actually want to give a donation every single one and this is what we call a recurring donor because it's someone who you're getting recurring transactions from every month. Some amount of money is going to their preferred non-profit.  So this matters too classy for several reasons from a business perspective. We take a transaction fee every time someone gives money to a nonprofit. So if we find that for current donors are actually resulting in more money coming in and classy has a business benefit of wine have more current donors some early when classy makes more money nonprofits make more money. So there's also a benefit here that if we can find a recurring donors are particularly important source of Revenue with a nonprofit will also want to boost that number of people who decide to become a supernova spoiler recurring donors are tend to get more money overall. So this is a pretty important thing the nonprofit space is how we get these recurring donors.  So I'm going to be in class his understanding you. What is the value of recurring donor and then there's some follow-up questions to there as well.  So this is a pretty good barge topic. There's a lot of ways you can tackle it. So we don't want to break down. What are the individual questions we can ask to build up to these larger questions around recurring.  The first question we're asking is just how much is a recurring donor worth. So if you want to be able to say okay, someone gives a monthly donation of excess amount. How much is that single person worth over their lifetime relationship with a nonprofit and how does that compare to the person who only donates one time?  Before giving way to answer. I'm a let you guys discuss for 2 minutes.  Let me put on a timer.  Accident head of the person next to you and talk to a couple minutes about what you think you would look at if you want to understand how much recurring donors are worth.  respect  Does anyone want to share?  What some of the ideas they had were for what a recurring how to figure out how much for current donors worth?  All right. I can also jump in stance if you guys want or one answer.  any takers  actually wrote a blogpost about this. So if you want to learn more actually go to the link down there making sure out the slides as well. Sorry about that, but I understand how much a typical donation was for a two groups of people. So we have one X owners and we have recurring donor. So the median one-time donation is $25 * lifx this make a second.  Comedian one-time donation was $50 but a median recurring donation is 25. So we first see this you think oh, well one-time donation is worth more than a recurring donation quite a recurring donation happens after several months. So even after just three months that recurring donor is worth more than that one-time donation. Now you're at $75. So that's how long is a recurring donor 10 to last for how many months we really expect someone to stay engaged before they decide. You know what I'm done. I want to cancel this plan. And so when we we can look at that question is what the sister will technique referred to as survival analysis. So survival analysis is really powerful because it allows you to take two types of data points. You have your people who were recurring for a certain number of months and I'm inside to stop so we only have an end date on that day to send someone for caring for a year or seven months. We know that end at some point in time, but we also have our  Who are still currently recurring and they didn't recurring for only 3 months. They didn't recurring for a year-and-a-half. And so we don't know when they're endpoint actually is and so is survival analysis you can use both types of these data both data that have this endpoint and ones that are currently happening. And from there. You can try and figure out okay, I text number of month what percentage of people tend to still be active. Can you get a plot that looks like this the little bit hard to read but the idea is basically on the x-axis you have the number of months that they've been recovering and on the y-axis is the percent chance that are still recovering.  So we can see here for example that at the one-year Mark about 60% of people are still have an active recurring plan. That's pretty good. So over half of people will have a recurring plan for at least a year.  At 18 months. It's a little bit between 40 and 50 but closer to 50. So again still pretty good. So from here, you can do some additional now. I have to figure out okay, if we know our typical recurring donations $25, we have some sense of what percentage of people last with certain number of months from there. We can figure out how much is your typical recurring donor worth over its expected lifetime.  And the volume we get is $485.  2.8 way here. Is that even though we looked at those first couple of numbers that that one-time donation look a lot bigger. We see what actually that lifetime value of recurring donor is much higher. So they're showing how beneficial it really is to try and convince people to become a recurring donor because you going to bring a lot more money over the long run that they decide to give one donation and walk away.  So I can't even talk about what were the data science skills that we had to use at the team to figure out this out and uses analysis. So one was sequel we had to pull the state of your SQL queries to get a sense of how large these transactions were how long they lasted all of that with Tobias people. Once we had our data together, we pulled it into our and that's what we did right now says cuz are a particularly good for these kind of stupid questions.  Which leads to the fact that we had to know statistics for survival analysis is not a New Concept but it is one that we had to understand and be able to execute well dancer question.  And then finally we had to be able to communicate this to a general audience. So this was information that we decided to make public and a blog post to all the non prophets who use our platform and other nonprofits as well. So we couldn't write it in a way that was just written for other data scientist understand. It really had to be clear for anyone to jump into this article and understand the benefit of having a recurring donor for the one time. So we had to use our skills of communication and writing to really story tell it to the right group of people.  All right. So given that we know that it is beneficial to be recurrent donor. You make more money out of it. The next question was how can we get more people to become a recurring donor? So how do I send a Viber? How do we convince people that they actually do want to become recurring?  So give me another two minutes to talk about how you would approach to this question.  apple cider cocktail  All right. Go back to slides.  Anybody want to share how they think they could go about trying to get more people to become recurring.  It's a secret right offer them something and say he was going to become recurring look at this thing. We actually have a case of that where one nonprofit had this crazy high rate of people to come in recurring and we didn't know what the secret was until we looked at Their donation page and found out they offered a free blanket to everyone who decide to become for hurting so free blankets are very good at getting people to sign up even if the cost of that blanket is whey last but how much they're giving overtime?  I never thought the ways you could try and find a way to do this.  All right. I'll tell you what we decided to do we did not offer everyone free blankets, but we decided to run an experiment on the actual donation page itself. So this was the original version donation page. You should open the page. You have a list of amounts that you could donate or you can put in the wrong amount and then we have these radio buttons where you could click if you wanted to be a one-time donation or a monthly donation center pretty small a kind of a side there after you would have clicked your amount people actually see that we wanted to see you could be at modify this URI so that people are more likely to come back.  So we updated to look like this we're now we have is much bigger buttons. They're above the amount. If you can see here this choosing to become monthly is a much larger tivity relativity original version. So we're an experiment to see if there was a difference where people are more likely to click that monthly button in the second case then in the first case. However, when you're running is kind of experiments, you can't be thinking about one particular metric to another metric that we capture a lot is conversion rate and conversion rate is the idea that a certain number of people are going to land on your donation page what percentage actually make a donation ideal you want higher conversion rates. I want cuz we had was okay. Maybe we'll get an effect. Where are indeed more people become recurring but maybe these buttons will scare off donors and will have a lower conversion rate over all since that would happen possibly negative business effect if we're getting fewer donations, even if more  relatively  surrounds experiment if it's probably sounds familiar. We had a condition and Abby condition is what we refer to as a b testing. So when you usually have these two competing conditions your compare and luckily our winter was condition fee.  Luckily, our winter was conditioned. So we found a significant effect sex with people were more likely to click that monthly button. If it was in a second condition brought to the first one and we also did not find any impact on conversion rate. There wasn't any effective or less likely to donate they donate just the same amount of rates. They did before just more of them became recording. So overall win for us. We decided to implement this throughout a product and so now all new donation Pages have the system  So what day does science skills when you for this? Well, we both have to experiment partially in Python. Once we're an experiment had set up we pulled in data again be a sequel and then we ran our analysis in r  because of other skills we needed so a general sense of experimental design and then specifically a b testing to really understand. How can we build an experiment where we know exactly what we're testing it snow words were very clear with the results mean.  And then finally made it had to be able to communicate this to stakeholder throughout the company. So when I worked on this project, it wasn't just me alone filling this out. I work with a product manager and had to write the result in a way that we're technical enough to have clear results, but not so detailed that someone coming into it out of Staff background or data science background me really confused. And so when he and I working together, he then took it up to the powers-that-be larger the company and that's how we got this approval to update the product the route and so being able to talk to people at different points in the company really important for having the result actually be implemented somewhere.  All right through done some work now in finding out how much required owners are worth. We've also found one way that we can maybe push people to become recurring sore. Last question was can we predict which donors are most likely to stay recurring or can we somehow predict which ones will switch to become a hurry? So we had some pool of non-recurring donors to Blue given one. Can you figure out a way to know which people in that group has convinced to become recurring its own them in that direction rather than just spamming everyone who's ever donated. Hey, do you want to ride?  I'll give you other two minutes to talk about this one.  That's what I call you right now.  Cabela's, like I like no. How are you?  Yakima  All right.  I don't want to share with their thoughts were on ways. We can predict either of these two things.  Yeah, so looking at user latency. So getting a sense of if someone has to spend a really long time then they might not like the experience as much or they might be less likely to come back.  Yeah, so there's also a lot of work here looking at what's the relationship between offline donations versus online donations? How can we reconcile these two things to understand how activate donor is beside just as one time?  So I can't give you the full details on what we're doing for this this is still working progress so I can give you a high level. So there's a couple ways we can look at the problem. And this is where you get into more of what I think people more costly think of data science as modeling type work. So one option is to do look at donor turn. So we talked about turn as someone who decides to leave and so in this survival stuff curb, for example, we talked about how many months does someone stay around before they left and deciding to not give any more, if you just turning and so we can build a model in this case will be a supervised model around donor. Turn. Where are basically predictor value in a one or a zero or if they've turned or not and then we have some variables that can predict. You know how much time they spend on the website given if they have offline donations as well. Can we predict likelihood of no return?  IPhone that model we cannot go back for nonprofit and say okay giving your list of returning donors. Here are the ones that we think are most likely to turn you might want to reach out to them and make sure that relationship is still good everything we can do we want to figure out who who is not yet a recurring donor might become one. Is there some kind of plastering and it would be an unsupervised technique. So if we have a bunch of data on our current One X owners, we can see if we can talk through them into different groups using these variables and then maybe we able to say okay people in group one. They donated once they're never coming back if they're not worth the time or money to try and get to the group number to maybe they've done some other things with a non-profit. They're fairly engaged. They're pretty good proof. That might want to come back. So using this modeling techniques, we can really dance or whacked nonprofits to say. Here's your top list of people you should reach out to and stay here anymore Target their appeals and make it more specific to that donors experience with a non-profit using these types.  All right. So again, what kind of data science field we need to approach the problem?  As always he might detect a c now you need to use SQL because we have to be able to clear the data to learn information about their behavior so far with a nonprofit building features.  We also use python on a couple different friends. So maybe we want to grab information about donors outside of how they use the platform maybe want to use demographic information about the area that they're from and so we could use Python to build in methods to add outside data sources to existing data sources nephew's ER structure for pulling outside data. Also, when we do the actual modeling produce more heavy-duty models will tend to do that in Python because I can in a great while if you want to build this into the product any point.  Pictures of other field obviously machine learning will you be able to build these predictive models are they be supervised or unsupervised. Are predictions and then finally communicate these results across to a lot of different parties. So let's say that we build a feature like this building to the product and marketing won't be able to talk about this. Well, if you use only high-level Steve Job, we had a cluster with a certain number of groups and the means for whatever that's not going to sound really great on some marketing copy. Do you need to be able to talk about the part that you've built in a way that the marketing some early if a sales person is on the phone and talk about this product. They need to have a list of facts, but they can quickly pull up to talk about it in a way that is clear and easy to understand quickly with Carpenter speaking to  And then finally of account managers for actually working with our current nonprofit. They're going to need to be able to explain, you know for their particular data set and their particular group of donors, which ones they recommend and why is it across all these different groups? We need to be able to communicate both what we've built and what the results of that model were to anyone who might be touching it with a lot of different people in this case.  Can you switch gears now and talk a bit about how to get a job in data science?  Again pointing out this has to give you all what I thought was my top recommendations given my experience on the job market and going from Academia to Industry.  She probably seeing image like this before I think you might have even seen it in this class where you talk about data science is a mix of all these different disciplines.  I don't really want to talk about that today. If not to say it is not valid and there's not benefits there for me. I just found that this doesn't really hit all the key points that I think I needed when I was going on my job search.  I really broke it down to three key things that I needed when I was looking for jobs. So one programming not terribly surprising. You need to be able to code.  Two-story telling if I go into more in a moment, but you also probably kind of got a glimpse of that when I'm talking about the skills we needed for each of the case studies seem to be able to talk about your work. And then finally, I think this is the one people find most surprising is networking.  And people usually have not the greatest response to say networking much are going to replace it and call it Community engagement. And so for me a really big part of this and finding a job is that you can't just be a silo Delon sending out job applications in really benefits you to interact with the broad or data science Community examples of how I think you can do that and what I mean by that for you to engage your community  Play the talking about programming. So I talked about all three of these languages today. Yo we use R for data analysis for data reporting obviously has a very strong cystic background python will use for many of those same things as well as filling out our data warehouse how we connect different data sources and then see people is obviously used for clearing data and being able to pull data in figure analyses.  Any thoughts on what is the number one needed skill of these three.  Raise your hand.  I got a few what about python pythons most important? Are you got a lot of people we got a few? All right. So I would say python was first of the voting and the weather is fecal Hall so much time writing SQL queries undervalued scale showing data science job interviews. There's a lot of talk about like, oh you're going to have to wait for it and python all these things. I've had more experience having to wipe board and steeple than any other language. So incredibly common that you will be asked to have pretty high sequel feels going into this job because before you can get to the point of building or models are doing urinalysis, you really need to know how to pull in data and clean it and seek with the way you're probably going to be doing that.  If you don't have any experience with SQL Don't Panic you will be fine. It's obviously relational algebra. You probably use other tool to had a similar framework. And I know one thing that people often hit with this is there like well, all I can do is work on my laptop. I don't have a huge database or practices with there are a ton of options for open source, free databases. You naturally build on your computer. And from there you can put in really simple tables tables that would work just fine reading directly with memory the play around with buildings and tables think about how you would build out a scheme of different table if you want to work with I just practice on your own machine running some people. Who is will come in super helpful for you when you're asked about these things. There's also it's important because I will be interacting with data engineers and do the engineers have to think about how we want to structure the tables. How do you want to have to relate to each other as a data scientist? They're going to want your input on how it's going to have  But you can have the most efficient Office later and having understanding of how people works and how you'll run queries will make it a lot easier to have that conversation. So people right now in data science. I said at least in the pre data science.  Connected Concepts Dimension with storytelling and so this important because you're going to be different people throughout your career going to have to talk to so you're going to have to talk to your team and explain some results you have and this is where you might give your metrics for how your mom's evaluated house improved over time. You're going to have to share results of product managers. So often when you're building a model or working on some kind of analysis, there's going to be some business value attached to it. I don't often do the product managers job to assess how worthwhile building out. This product is if they want to spend more engineering resources to go further with it. And this is where you to be able to communicate your goals how you're defining success and what you've done so far.  You're going to need to work across departments. So in my current position, I'm technically based in the product department. So we're supposed to just be looking at how the product behaves but I've also worked with Finance to try and work on some of their questions. I work with marketing and so each of these teams. We would be able to talk to them about the data and a result in a way that's helpful and applicable to them and using a vocabulary that they also are used to if we can both get the most out of the relationship.  And then finally depending on your position, you might also be public facing blog post. So we do a fair amount of thought leadership. We try and write a blog post on our results. We have an annual report. Will you write once a year on the state of data on our platform and easy accessible to any audience? So where this comes in in the application cycle is that you will definitely have at least one interview where someone sold job is to assess your communication ability. And so they're going to ask you things like tell me about a time when you did something like this or tell me about when you had to work with someone annex department and they going to have to talk through these problems, but he's different audiences. Actually, I'll give you one of the things that I always ask people so done a fair amount of interviewing and there's one question. I always ask whether it's for a senior data scientist or for an intern.  My default lost everyone is pick up projects that you worked on any project that you like and give me the elevator pitch in two ways one as if I know nothing about your field and one as I'm an expert in your field.  and being able to see how well people can modulate the way they talk about the same problem can give you a lens to their communication abilities and her storytelling abilities recommend practicing these to talk to your projects find friends who you also want to be data scientist find friends with no interest in being data scientist you working on  And the last thing I'm going to go over is community engagement before going over in more of these details. I'm going to show you one of the projects that I worked on as a side project of my friends. So we decided that people were misusing data visualization and that bar pots were bad. So we decided to make a Kickstarter called bar bar plot, which sole purpose was to educate the world on data visualization sell some T-shirts and then send teachers to journal editors in the hopes that they would change their practices. And so to do this, we actually made a video that I can show you off.  Has this ever happened to you?  These look the same what's going on all the papers? I reuse Barbara wonder why anyone uses bar flights?  confession motivated PhD student  That's true. I think about this particular problem. A little more dogs are on the Paris do will probably form a normal distribution. But what about cat the cat will get One Republic at another of the zoo giving us a bimodal distribution.  Bishop's Wife important to always such a daze hadn't noticed invented face before do I get it now as a motivator PhD student points.  Kickstarter campaign is an initiative to raise awareness about this issue in publishing.  Friends don't let friends make us one of these delightful t-shirt. Remember games that let pancake volleyball.  All right, baby. See how productive my postdoc was.  Sorry.  All right, so it doesn't not recommending. Do you want to go out and make a Kickstarter for my point was just that this is something fun that my friends and I didn't decide things. We were passionate about and I had it on my resume and it came up all the time and interviews because it was a really simple kind of funny thing around a to science that I've done and so every interview were really like talking about this as just like a cute fun thing that we did a show about the work that I was doing. Just trying to find what is that thing that you like to do when you can Showcase in some way cuz it really does differentiate you from everyone else is applying for these jobs.  For more detail on different ideas for working on community engagement. Make a Blog highly recommend any time you're working on a project. Don't just let a live on your computer and going anywhere else put it up their share it with the world. Even if no one sees it right now. It's great to have an archived. So when you do go on the job market and people go to your website, they can see all these different projects you've done in different ways. He thought about  Similarly when you write a blog post share it on social media. I know again this seems like not the most common thing. I'm not a huge social media users just felt really awkward for me at first but I would do things like post on LinkedIn. I would get comments on it people that like it and it's also actually a really great way to meet people and make mentors contacts. So I tweeted one post. I did a friend of mine who's better Twitter than I am retreated it and then through a series with and someone who is fairly decently you famous in the communities thought I'd made a comment about it. And from there I was able to make a connection with someone in data science would probably not have met otherwise unable to get ideas mentorship from moving forward so which is a great way to meet new people and then find people who might also be looking to hire someone in the future.  Nothing, we can check starter. But think of your fine thing. What's something you really like about data work on it may be something for a key at the you can also share and put in your resume.  Alan finally go to meet up meet us there also a great place where you can meet new people you can find out about subwoofers and it's also if you're maybe more advanced you can also get back from mentor people it so I really enjoy being able to work with people or maybe at the beginning other data science career. He will work with them through learning new skills practicing tutorials and giving advice and text apps so highly recommend going to meet up.  All right. Leave me to my top recommendations for getting a job in data science again getting the caveat just my recommendation.  Number one is learn SQL spend the time to try and learn it. You're definitely going to give yourself an advantage if you can say that you were conceived full well.  To find a personal interest or hobbies and think of data science projects you can build from those. So I'll hit a differentiator for us and we're looking for people to hire is do they just have experience in a language but there's no proof or maybe they have some projects that are only products in class or they're only the most common table projects. Think about something that you're genuinely interested in. You have to think about what are data postions that maybe no one's answered yet or something that you're curious about one investigate more passionate about it's going to get that much easier for you to build up his project really spend your time on it. When you work on this project push Dakota to get Hub. So here you can again how this public record of you claim that you can code next language. Now, you can point to this project and you can point to your coat you worked on with that red summer weight to your application that you really are indeed able to coat in that language.  Additionally right up those results and put them in a blogpost. It's a great way to Showcase your work and show the storytelling aspect. You can really show how your communication skills are show that you're able to explain to people your thought process if you filled out your project.  Play Finally I advertise your blog post on social media. So whatever your social media preference maybe and maybe we'll have, the way to improve it. And that's also fairly helpful. Can you actually learn from what you're working on? Continually try to make it better?  Next to me. There's a ton of available. Some of them are pretty nice and certain proofs and we'll see some of the greatest ones because they're really focused on a particular group of people are particularly interested in see if they're having to poop Orioles if you want to pick up a new skill and if you can going for a while and we've been working on some of these projects going to meet up and that's the great way to again work on this communication skills get practice talking about your work. And then also what is another form of advertising so you can talk about yourself announce your name somewhere that you've been approved centered at X meet up in San Diego. All of these are kind of my recommendations for building out your skill-set while you're building it out doing it in the way they really showcases the work that you're doing.  My last one is talk to other data scientist. People are generally very Pro talking about their careers. People have ping me on LinkedIn about stuff. I ping people on LinkedIn when I was first starting and as long as you write a message that shows that you're not totally random interesting people and mention something they did everything but the company they work at people tend to respond. They like to be able to provide feedback and help. So if you see someone's work, they're doing anything. It's interesting. She's a message tell them that if you have a question for them, they'll probably give you back some kind of answer and I will just give you more information on what the field is like what people are doing and try to give you a better sense of where you want to go in that direction and I kind of position that you're looking for so they'll be other thing to remember for data science and just is that you should be finding a job that fits for your goals not just trying to find whatever going to hire you really understand with in data science. What do you want to work on where your passion and then find the right to?  jobs, you can do that at  All right. So thanks everyone for having me and opened up questions.  Open my weather frog if you need images for presentations. I highly recommend the noun project. They have a bunch of great little images. So  How often do you have the data you need to answer the question within the databases for the project? So you want to do or how hard is it to get those data? Yeah, so I would say that in the early days. We had some pretty easy hits where we just wanted to figure out some really basic stuff about how user Behavior was working and likes how nonprofits work and we're pretty good there. Now that we've answered some of these easier questions for finding like 50% of the data we want is there this is why it's really important to be able to other teams because I need to be able to go to an engineer and say hey I really want to be able to track this particular feature in the product. When can I get that added into your next?  Set of work so I can track that don't say that once you have easy hits. There's a lot of work trying to figure out where there's gas. What is the most benefit to fill those gaps in terms of 10 things you want for the three most important and then the other place where we've done a lot of work is with these external dataset. There's a lot of data that is out there and we want to bring in but it takes time to build up an interface in a super messy. So trying to put it in a clean nice format is a lot of work. We've a great engineer who's helped out without a lot for the data scientist. You'll also have to eat Consulting in the process to  Any questions from the crowd?  Would you say that a fair amount of your time is spent more? So in terms of like data wrangling and making a Thai tea or in terms of Pi call the communication after so you guys have to do in the car thinking of new questions to ask 50% is a dangling and just thinking about things like filters like we have a pretty broad. Do you said in terms of weave a lot of different nonprofits do you work with there's a lot of seasonality effects. And so just trying to finalize what are the set of filters do you want for that analysis? If you've done a fair amount of job scoping the project than a lot of the actual analysis won't take super long because you kind of went in the sense of what I would look like and then the other communication 50% data wrangling and then maybe late like 20% of the actual.  Modeling that can bury have obligated is and then he likes 30% I'm just communicating out and getting like Vienna coffee company or you want to do.  So my work in linguistics was primarily on acoustic data and looking at how people speak and so the skill sets that I've marketed myself out there when the job market at the saying, you know, I have a lot of experience in building models around really messy datastax be able to Port basically those higher level skill set in linguistics also talked about experimental design. I have a lot of experience building experiments and whatever field you're starting out in when you want to cut transition. Just trying to think of what's that higher level of skill set and then think of key examples where you can say, you know, you do testing at your company. Here's an example of what I did testing in Academia. You do modeling hear the model that I built in Academia between Linguistics and then industry  other questions  What was the most surprising thing or unexpected things when you started your job as a data scientist unanticipated how much you need SQL on a play on YouTube and that was probably like the biggest shocker for me and then I'll decide eating a lot of sequels wasn't terribly surprised by that like when I was actually confronted with increasing so having spent so many years in Academia. There's all this a lot of pressure of like it needs to be perfect and you need to double-check a thousand times. It's exactly right and you have the best performance and you're waiting to publish it takes a long time to get that final stage Industries. We work on two weeks Prince Paisley, you set up work for 2 weeks after time work may move over you might have a project that spans multiple friends, but there is a pretty big push to get stuff done. And so if you get to a place where you know, it's good enough and answers the question.  People are happy and you move on to the next project until you move a lot faster and people are much more. Okay with good enough compared to Academia. That was an adjustment I'd say  so a lot of companies will use redshift postgres. So that that tells you the dialect that I've encountered the most one thing is really nice about it is you can use with statements. So when I was supposed to rain in SQL, I did more like the classical version of SQL and you have to like Nest queries into each other and becomes very difficult to read friendship in which statements allow you to avoid that and so I'd say most companies are using redshift now from what I've heard.  Any other questions?  All right, before we send page one more time. I'm going to open up the iclicker. So if you didn't getting you can at the end and let's get paid one more round.  If you already responded you're good to go.  camp "
