Even if you've done a lot of the assignment already this time, there are many more assignments and you'll be working with this group so they can pick up the slack later on. So while I'm doing announcements to look on Beyonce, if you can remember to look later you want to be hanging if you don't have a roof. So try to look for people with in your section who are looking for group mate and welcome them into your group if you can You should be in a group by now, but it is okay. If you are not your first assignment is due this Friday that assignment is getting your question together that you're going to be acting throughout the quarter looking for data that you might be able to use.  I'm thinking about the ethical implications of urinalysis.  I am going to get everybody to another minute or so to look at the house and then I'll finish with the rest of the course reminder so we can get going from there.  All right for the rest of the reminders as you guys are trying to look on Piasa to help other classmates out and welcome them into your group.  The first time it's due this Friday right before midnight. The third reading is due next Friday again. You'll have something to do every Friday just before midnight.  B Graves from the second reading quiz have been released on Friday night. You should be able to see what you got right and what you got wrong.  Second bullet went up there in the smaller side is reading a discussion questions. That's just a link to questions that your water filtration on his new friend here is putting together each week as he's going through to be used in his section. But these are a great resource for anybody in any of the sections are just want to make sure that you guys have that link on Sean also posted it on Piazza if you're in a group of four or looking for a group or willing to welcome somebody into your group. Please let them know if you have to help them out if you've already done while the first assignment, like I said, they can help pick up the slack on future assignments going forward. That's when it has a big issue. I just wanted to reiterate that we are trying to minimize and eliminating any emails to TA than I ate everything should go on Piazza. So you should not be emailing your t a r i a directly  Any questions on any of that?  Okay.  So starting in on today's topic today is going to be the first lecture where we discussed any type of programming. We're going to be looking at and writing code today. Sorry learning objectives.  Will be to explain why programming is helpful. I'm from the perspective of a data scientist cuz there are lots of things that code. Can you bring for an accomplished but there's a somewhat special way in which data scientist 10 to program and we're going to include at the end of this lecture and a number of lectures some basic programming Louisville, or I'll do a normal lecture how we've been doing it for the beginning pause. You guys will transition into working on a laboratory notebook, which will be at the end the links that I will be at the end of these lies will go to be settled and then we'll work through that for the remainder. So you guys can actually get some programming practice in class.  Play showed this part last time except I colored it for Version Control. So just remind everybody these are data from your survey one was I've never programmed and 10 was I could teach in intro programming course the programming as I said before that will be doing is geared at the people who have less experience programming for those who are more experienced. That means you will be able to help your classmates. You'll be able to consider how we're going in. This course is different than what you've learned in other courses. So hopefully everybody will learn a bit of programming as a data scientist from this course and we'll start getting comfortable with programming on Pergo Swift Never program before  This is also from the survey that I sent out. So were you looking at here are those who are familiar with python? And those who are familiar with our you can see lots of the students in this course 175 of you are familiar pythons, but many of you are not many fewer. If you are familiar with our I picked these two programming languages for the survey because these are the two languages most frequently used by scientists and we'll be discussing our and I'll show you a few examples of our throughout the course, but you won't be expected to write any AR code to read any AR codes anything to do with python vice versa is true. I will discuss the differences between them a little bit during today's lecture.  Okay, so we'll get started. I just am curious to know what programming language you are most comfortable in. So the frequency code is a d it's written up on the board. Also if you come in late, which you wouldn't know that message cuz you're already here. Okay?  Make sure your vote registered I had to open it twice.  I'll close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  parts of the intro programming course in computer science to the best of my knowledge is taught in Java know that many of you who are in this category could also be comfortable in a different language. This is great that we have class familiar with python that will help when you guys are working on your assignment to help as we start program class. You can get help from each other's in the neighbor and your neighbors and then a number of you are not comfortable any programming language.  I mentioned that we're going to listen to a few minutes. I'll be about 10 minutes of this video. This comes from Bret Victor. He is a mind and think about how we Design Systems for programming. So this is a talk that he gave a few years back and forth. I want you to consider how this differs from the way in which you programmed for those of you who have not programmed. I'm you get a sense of how programming works. So we'll listen to this for 10 minutes and hopefully the audio works and I should have tested this before class.  Confidentially about living your life that most people don't talk about.  Is your picture to learn a lot about?  following your passion  give me something you love something kind of different.  Finding a guiding principle trailer work something you believe is important and necessary and right.  Can using that fit guide what you do?  Horses. I'm freaking talk about the principle that guides lot of my work and try to give you a taste of what comes out of that and I'm going to talk about some other people that it looked this way with the principal are what they believe in examples to help you. Think about what you believe in and how you want to live your life.  Play with me.  Ideas are very important to me. I think that bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do and I think that great ideas in the form of stories inventions scientific theory is so I think a lot about how people and how ideas grow in a particular what sorts of tools for the healthy environment by Diaz, bro.  What time of the year is making creative tools using kratom?  Raiders  needed a minute connection for the critic my principal to make a change and make a decision. You need to see the effect of that immediately.  Not ashamed a series of cases where I noticed that the principles violated about that.  What's think about coding and something comes out?  Janus case that says JavaScript going to a canvas and it draws this little scene with the tree.  If there's anything wrong with this can or if I don't like changes if I have further ideas, I could go back to the code and I didn't the code compile and run.  So it looks like anything wrong I go back to the code. Most of my time is spent working in the code working a text editor blindly without an immediate connection to this thing will eventually find an egg.  I feel disgusting as his principal. I have that cleaners need an immediate connection.  So we're here cuz I thought speaks on the side and the code on the side and across the sky in the mountains.  I want to make any change the code.  the picture changes immediately  So the code in a picture of him always NSYNC, there's no compile and run. I just change things in the code and I see things changing the picture.  Why don't we have this immediate connection between the code in the picture? We can start thinking about ways of changing the code of than typing. So for example, this number here has enough to it down.  So I can see what it looks like for big roaches or small branches and I can on what feels right to me artistically.  What sports rating under the curve explained to a ballad of a down and some of these numbers here? I know what they do, but completely surprising.  Sit down here and I'm putting 16 little thing blossoms on every branch and I can turn that down for Less Blossom returned for more. Look at what I'm doing here. I'm just kind of moving that number up and down around 20 or so and has this really interesting shivering affect. The wind is blowing through the tree.  The first time I saw this I'm Italy start thinking about how he uses effect word animation.  How would I ever a discover that if I had to compile and run but never change?  So much of our creation is Discovery and you can't discover anything if you can't see what you're doing.  Adjusting the code. Let's add some code so I can put a son up here in the sky. So go to the end of the draw Sky function and I want to fill Circle contacts Phil Circle and soon as I start typing I get his auto complete list of the difference is autocomplete list. I made at least seen with each of them is doing  So I don't have to imagine what it would do. If a method named and have to win the documentation. I just seen it immediately for net and the y coordinate she's the radius of it.  And that looks about right, should be yellow. So I'm going to set the Philips Phile on text Bill Stiles and I can change that color code see my change. Any number went to it before came and my son.  It was kind of interesting I thought.  I can expect that but with white and now looks like the moon spat, right?  it looks like.  So having some connection ideas to surface to develop in ways, that would be impossible before.  Coastal pulmonary think which is this picture and I've got his coat over here and I have to maintain the mapping between the two in my head and I don't really know what it does.  So here's what I can do I can.  So I want to know what's going on. I just kind of roll down the bunker and see what my lights.  It's a haircut to call to draw Mountain. I don't know which glitch.  Intercessor work the other way to see part of the picture. I need to know what code was responsible for doing it the same thing. I pulled out of the picture on the right is jumping to the line of code that true that pixel.  Saturn Sky measure the tree blossom  it's really hard for me to have nothing but it's also gorgeous full just for navigating around so, you know.  So he talked about his principal that he like this design on and the fact that he really needs this immediate connection to what he's created when he's writing code. How is edema tell me how this differs or similar to the programming Dave done historically.  This is exactly how you've done. It is this different?  How old is your experience that when writing code?  How many people think this is similar to what they've done before?  Okay, I don't see any hands anybody who thinks this is different than what they've done before. Okay, so we have some hands there.  You've likely written code run it to executed and something has happened. You created something. You've generated a graphic you have built software. This reverse is what's kind of really unique to this the fact that you can highlight something in what you've created Anakin direct you back to the code and clearly their design principles behind us that we can use me before and I think you could imagine you'll see how this could be helpful. And of course, we'll be using jupyter notebook switch allow you to test things out but it doesn't allow you all the full flexibility to test out all of the possibilities as easily as in this video. So it's important to keep in mind that when you're writing code and your specifying a certain values that you're limiting all of the possibilities that could be possible this video just to demonstrate that when you write code and executed something happens or less familiar with the programming and to demonstrate that programming is not static how we do it today will not be how we do it in the future and here's another great toe.  About how we are not really great at predicting what's going to happen this videos on YouTube of his other talks are on YouTube. So you're if you're interested you can go find those today likely won't be the way we always do it and you'll have to adapt over your crib and that they're clearly thinks that we're not doing right now that could be possible and helpful.  All right, sweet an intro. We have some concept of how programming works. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about why you would learn to program with a particular focus on as a data scientist. So there are lots of reasons to learn to code but we're going to talk about within the confines of how data scientists often use it.  So the first one I'm going to show you and I'll walk you through this cuz I know they might not all be familiar often do scientist use tabular data or to spend a lot of time talking about what that means we have here is a spreadsheet of data and we have some countries we have the continents and then we have some information about the GDP the population and the GDP per capita start the life expectancy over there over time and if he decided he wanted hemisphere rather than continent, you would manually change that and then go through a type all of those and okay, you don't have to type all of them. You could just use copy and paste so you go and do that here in your next category, then you copy it and paste it but this is clearly a slow process. So this is an example of somewhere where code completely needs removes the need to do that. So this is all this is not we'll be using this course because either code over here the code executes over here. What I'm showing here is that were using that same data set so you can see the country of the continent and the same information. So says the exact same data set  I showed you with the spreadsheet. We were manually editing code runs. We make the change we can look back at that data. That seems spreadsheet.  As it runs, we look back we can see now that that hemisphere has happened and you can see that old in that initial when I had Pitt western when it should have been Eastern Hemisphere for Country. So we're manually editing spreadsheets we often because we're humans make mistakes. The last thing you would want to do is mess up your data. So code removes the need to manually edit spreadsheet. It also allows you to make some pretty cool graphics. These are those data plotted over time. So it's life expectancy and GDP per capita and we're fast-forwarding overtime and it's broken down by continent just a few lines of code and barcode again. You don't need to know our code. I'm just getting an idea of what you can do.  It allows you to make them flexibly. So after I make that change to which hemisphere there in you can then see all of that data and just Tupac's rather than the five or six before and again, it's just a few lines of code.  The goal of writing code and learning to program is so that you don't have to manually edit among many other things. But the goal is really to get the computer to do the work for you. You'll save yourself a lot of time and I'll be able to make it work more reproducible.  So let's briefly this will become a clicker question, but I'm going to walk through two videos. So the first one and I'll explain as we go I use the same data. I highlight two columns. I then create a graphic realize it's not the type. I want to change it to a lecture.  And that's the first example and a second one. I typed out all the code while I was creating it so you can see exactly how long it took.  So I'm looking at a few packages and then I write the code for the plot. I can see that in like four lines of code.  I was typing slowly that day.  Specify the park run that code that executes over here and then down. Here we go plot and we ultimately have a very similar-looking plot to what was done in the first case. So question is which of these is reproducible one on the left to the one on the right and the options are down at the bottom.  I got a few more seconds.  3 2 1  alright, so we have the majority of people saying that both are reproducible and then about even saying either only one or only two is so I want to have a discussion about your thoughts here cuz we had kind of a people all over the board with a few people that aren't sure so this discussion can help them hone their thoughts on this.  Can I have the spot on which one or both are reproducible?  I know you guys had a long weekend and you're tired by one is reproducible.  nobody  anybody want to defend why to is reproducible.  awesome, I volunteer  Cuz this one.  another joke  Eustis program on other Davis have to perform what they want to do great. So I'm to overhear the argument is the code is here. We could put that on GitHub. It could be shared by all and then they could use the same data code for different date. Is that going forward? So I'm going to argue that too is reproducible. So for those of you who said that too is I'm with you there. What about one? Why do people think this is reproducible?  I'm going to argue that this one example of specific example I gave you is somewhat reproducible, but I could tell you the steps highlight these two columns click this button change the what and that's three steps. So this concept can be reproducible when things are really simple, but what if I want to change the axes and change the size of the van so that everybody could see it or change the type of font or the colors of the but then it's a lot of things that you need to keep track of in order to tell somebody else how to reproduce what you did. So what I'm going to say is that on the right side to this one where you have code that you can run and get the same result each and every time is the reproducible example and 2-1. Sorry is only referred as woman. Things are super simple.  I'm going to argue here that programming allows for things to be more reproducible, especially as things get more customized and more complicated which they almost certainly will as you start doing your projects.  Any questions on my Arguments for why the one on the right with the code that generator pot was reproducible and not necessarily the using Google Excel or Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to generate plants.  Okay.  So we talked about the fact that you don't have to manually added data that you can quickly edit data programmatically without ever losing the day to you started with weave now talk about how it makes things more reproduce. And argue that there are a lot of data companies are collecting more and more data. There are lots of data science jobs out there and it is not going anywhere. So we're going to continue to be jobs that require programming skills.  Now here's my disclaimer it through this course you realize you hate programming and that you're not interested in analyzing data and statistics are the worst. I would disagree with you there and there are other jobs out there. If you hate it don't do it for the rest of your life. But if you do there are going to be jobs there lots of data that need to be analyzed. Okay. So there any overtime about good reason to learn to code in fadley reasons to learn to code and I'm just going to have it if you would then you can read these a detail later but your goal is to get super duper rich and to create the next Facebook the planets are the best motivator for learning to program that could be a byproduct of that could happen, but maybe don't Bank on that. So really you should want to learn to code because it really helps in getting practice with precise thinking if you've never written code before you are going to write that code that creates hours that you have no idea what they mean and over  Time does process will get easier because programming requires you to be incredibly precise, but I'm not a letter is capitalized or lowercase matters. The way things are aligned matters and it requires you to really get precise with what you're doing and why we require you to be precise is also requires abstract thinking so if you want to solve a problem you first have to figure out how you would write code to solve that problem. So it allows you to practice being precise and also to think abstractly we mentioned the computer to do the work for you and it's a great practice for learning itself. We're going to talk about how to learn in a general sense when you're learning to program in a bit.  Okay throughout the lecture and this is really just to let you know if you never program before that. You're not alone. It's not it's really a selling point of learning to program but it will require you to be persistent. It can be a frustrating process. But when you keep getting an error and then finally figured out that part is rewarding at least it should be and again if you were still frustrated at the end sit back and think about why you're frustrated and if it's cuz you hate the process that's something to think about. These next few slides are in here and they're definitely going to sound like a pep talk cuz that's what they are. But I think it's important to really solidify how you should approach learning when you're learning to program.  First message is that to learn to program you have to write code there books out there that you can read and you could get the basics of what's going on and they're supposed to be really really helpful, but you won't really learn how to code until you do it. So you'll have to write code in order to learn how to program. So in this course will be doing some of that but in your free time, you can find data online you can try and do something that interests you and you will get better at programming by writing code.  I mentioned this already can be frustrating and hard you'll comment about wanting to throw your computer out the window from time to time and I still do.  And the boys and remember is a data scientist fail all the time. You see these awesome analyses are awesome products that are launched from companies. And those are they successful project at the end of a bunch of failed attempt it it don't show all the failed attempts along the way. So remember any time you see something awesome people make mistakes along the way people fail at these don't put that in your product at the end. Okay, this is something I want to cuz I think there's there lots of different ways people can approach this and I would like to suggest that you first try things on your own but then do ask questions and we'll talk about how you can do that and then proposed think try read so first you should think about what it is you want to do don't you go hacking away without actually knowing what it is you're trying to accomplish because once you figure out what it is you want to accomplish you'll know if you got there you'll find out if you succeed on the first time awesome. If not, you should go to Google or stack Overflow or that book you have or your friend that sitting next to you or your TA or I or me and office hours and we can help you figure.  I want you to look elsewhere for the answer repeat the process think make sure you're still a you know, what you're trying to accomplish. Try it out and just do this at her to flee.  I'm so with that. I wanted to see your all your thoughts on how long you think you should try something out when it comes to programming before reaching out to someone for help.  because in a few seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so we have a lovely distribution where people most people think that it should be in the one-hour Mark and then we have people on either side of that and then some people say it's best to just figure it out on your own.  So I'm going to argue that 5 minutes when your programming in the beginning is likely not long enough. You're going to struggle with things for more than 5 minutes and that's okay. But if you get to the 30 minutes to an hour mark somewhere in here and you're still having the same wall and have made no progress and can't figure out at all. What issue? I'm you're making then it's time to reach out. And again when you're down here, you can be Googling and looking on stackoverflow that but if you before you reach out to someone else and ask them to help you solve your problem. You should probably spend somewhere more than 5 minutes, but less than an hour.  So know that five minutes is not out of the question, you will spend many time any more than 5 minutes when you're first learning to program.  Okay.  So I've already know their entire quarter's dedicated to teaching the basics of program or the basics of a single programming language. We're only going to be spending some of a number of lectures in here on program the rain be discussing the concept of end-user programming. So how do we utilize the tools that are out there to accomplish our data science goals, and this will not cover all the details you need to know to program for things like exams. I expect you to understand the code that was run in class and to be able to him again. They're all giving multiple choice exams, but you understand what you should do using the tools and skills. We talked about in class.  I'm at about three principles that I want you guys to get good practice on in class today or in class during this quarter. So code generally and their exceptions to every rule should be commented. So this is maybe a little excessive when you're looking at code and you see a pound sign with a space of beginning your line or it just a pound sign to start your line. That is something to the computer ignores and it's just a note to you and anybody else reading your coat so you would want to but you would want some explanation of what the next few lines of code are doing in your projects.  Also, we're going to have practice having good variables with good names which might be different than what you've done in other programming Arena don't care if we have a file and this is the name of the file. We're going to assign it to a variable. I'm going to talk in a minute with variables are bile underscore name SN wouldn't be the best variable name because someone else wouldn't automatically know what's included in that variable.  The last thing is a white face alignment matter. Sometimes python will force you to use specific white face alignment and other times. It's just to make it easier for other humans suffer example, as I had a very nice pool days and included this information notice that the alignment starts here rather than this option where the variables here and then the contents are lined up with it. This is much easier to see what the variable is and what the contents are so we can practice writing code of comments having good variable names and white face alignment.  Any questions on those three?  The question is are we going to be using Python 3 or python to worry be using Python 3 and all the programming you doing class will be in the collaboratory Jupiter lab notebooks before going to start at the end of class and that's 3 automatically.  Do you want anything installed locally for this course, but for your other courses, I'd imagine you would.  Okay.  A little bit on where to find health and how to help others stack Overflow. It will be a great resource for you. So this is what stack Overflow looks like. This is where developers of people who write code from any language. Just python go to ask and answer questions. You'll likely want to get an account there. That way you can contribute to the community and what you do is you will search just like you would anywhere else and different questions that have previously been asked will show up. They'll be Tagged so you can search by tags. You can see that this question was I in 2012 answers and 107 volts the votes help you prioritize which one's the best answer you'll be able to see everybody's answer but the most helpful will likely be the first one up there.  That's what I was going to ask a question, but there are rules for asking questions. You shouldn't just right off the bat ask a question on stackoverflow likely somebody has asked something similar before so you should make sure that that question is not somewhere else. And then also the questions on stackoverflow have to be specifically related to programming so to be on topic and it would be specific and specific means you can't just ask a very general question without anybody else having contacts for what you're asking. The question also has to be relevant to others that can't be how do I do my analysis on this particular dataset? You wanted to get it down to a question. That would be generalizable to the greater population.  So I'm going to spend a few slides on talking about how to help others. So, how did not be a jerk? You should be mindful of your word choice and tone I talked about this on Piazza. You guys have been great so far you guys in your emails to me have been nothing but respectful. I really appreciate that and this likely doesn't apply to you guys. This thing is it has become a place on the internet. That isn't always welcome to everybody. So I feel the need to include this in here to remind you to or anywhere on the internet be kind helpful and don't be a big it. Okay, and the reason is important is because last year stackoverflow announced that their platform is not very welcoming and it's time to change that so they acknowledge that they have a problem and that people on stackoverflow have been jerks more often than is acceptable. I was it acceptable level 0 but they were way above zero.  So they put out his code of conduct and you can read the whole thing. If you'd like to add a very specific examples of how to not be a jerk. So for example, what you should not do is if you bother to read my question, you know, it's not a duplicate. That's not a helpful way to respond to somebody and said you could take a look at my question is about cement board while the question you asked about drywall to specify what is required by what it is you're asking about rather than going to work can sometimes be easier when you're on the Internet or in general to jump to being negative.  I'm going to have you as me through these which of the following is the best response if you were responding to somebody on stackoverflow.  I'm going to close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  so you all overwhelmingly said  I'm not I'm not sure I quite understand but I think you're asking about and then you would clarify that is the only one that will move this in a productive manner fullard.  This one is just a statement. It's not going to help clarify what's going on? It's not going to move everything forward and the same with this one. This is not an acceptable response. And this is a s at the first time they probably did their best. So try to help guy then as to what would be a better way to frame the question.  We talked so far about what programming looks like with a video we talked about why data scientist program. We talked a little bit about the benefits and how it improves reproducibility and what generally coach of look like. This is the part of the what should I learn?  So you're looking at here are data again from stack Overflow. They do a survey every year and we have on the y-axis is the percent of stack Overflow questions that month answer you're looking over time and the orange line is python so you can see that over matter of 10 years. They went from 4% of the questions on stackoverflow to about 10% So Python and R are the most commonly used programming languages among data scientist with python being more popular than r  The reason of these two are the ones that data scientist intend to use because there are lots of other programming languages out there that are great for lots of different thing specifically R and python have a clear simple structure and then text so you will be able to learn the basics pretty quickly and then those will apply throughout your process of learning more more. So we're going to cover just the basics of using us to analyze data in this course, but the clear simple syntax makes learning the beginning pretty easy and getting started pretty easy.  This rapid development and prototyping you're able to I right through different things and try a bunch of things out pretty quickly and easily. So excuse with it will be using these to execute within the notebook you be able to try a bunch of things out without raising a bunch of time and last thing at all cross-platform compatible as they work on these operating systems and there are large online communities for both of the purples R and python. So your questions that you have have likely been asked before and you can get help online.  With regards to python its projected to just keep on growing overtime and while you can't predict the future too far out because different things happen in the programming world. It's predicted that you'll be using python for a while.  I'm with the right to python in our this is looking at year-over-year growth and you can see the python in our have very similar year-over-year growth. And as I mentioned python just has more users from the get gecko. So it's bothering creating a similar race. Python is used by more people.  One caveat mentioned is that academics tend to use are so if you're going to go into biological research or you're going to go into statistics of Vital Statistics in Academia intend to work in a lab. You'll you're more likely to use our than you are python again. It's not a hard-and-fast rule.  Okay, so that's why are a python or used will be using python in this course. I'm here is a picture of Guido van Rossum. He is the person who wrote Python and he has written this then of python. You don't need to memorize this you don't need to fully understand any of it. So when you want to know is that there are mantras that exists within the python community and they are expectations of how you will use Python server example, beautiful is better than ugly. There is ugly, You can write that will run and there is pretty cool that you can write that will run and pretty code of the ones that has good good alignment that's easier to run by humans and can be understood by humans just reading through it is better than ugly code that still runs the same thing simple on the same idea is better than complex complex is better than complicated. The goal was always to write code that is as simple as possible. That's not always possible and those caissons. It's okay to make your code a little more complex, but you really want to avoid making it overly complicated.  Cigarette through the recipes just want you to know that is in a python is a thing any python world and that it's good to try to adhere to these month.  Toddler or talk about python if you go on the internet right now and search why are stupid and my python a stupid you'll see lots of responses from community members hating the other one. I'll just mention that he's like maybe the biggest name in our world and he is one of the biggest names in the python world and they're working on a project. There's no reason use what works for you. There is no reason to track the other one because you like one. I'm better than the other.  But I had it at this but I wanted to make it explicitly clear their science is constantly changing. It has changed a lot over the 10 years that it has become a popular term to start somewhere. With python in his course, but technology changes you're going to be required to know and use and learn more than one programming language in your career. So a quality of a great day to scientists that they are able to adapt to new technology in new programming languages quickly.  All about that so far. I want to touch on what differs between how you maybe learn to program in a computer science course versus how we're going to be approaching programming in a data science course form of Honor there any questions  Okay really is at the core of what the truth feels are the computer science is the study of the theory and practice of how computers work. The goal is to understand the ins-and-outs of computers for data science is the scientific process of extracting value from data. The goal is to understand the ins-and-outs of the date of your working with because of these differences in the field. The typical job duties are a little bit different. So I'm overgeneralizing hear computer scientist do lots of different things but most often they are writing code that goes into some software or some application or integrating parts of their code with a larger product. So they're working in teams in testing and documenting and debugging code. Where is that a scientist are collecting cleaning and organizing data sets there going to be answering questions and building models with which to answer they're not out of the question with their analysis and they're going to be making visualisations to help communicate their findings.  Because of this data is the emphasis in data science. So your programming skills should always work with focusing on the data whereas computer scientists are great and super important, but the process is a little bit different as to how you approached programming.  I like to use this visual. So there's a balance between lots of things and again is a generalization but data scientist or more users of the tools that are out there to answer their questions. Whereas computer scientists are more heavily creators of building something new rather than utilizing with already out there.  Some more specifically data scientists are really good at getting the data. They need Austin is means getting it out of a database will touch on that next lecture and it worth exploring and cleaning. The data will be doing that in this course with python and they're very comfortable working with tabular data, which will also talk about next lecture. So Python and R make both of those steps very easy, and I prioritize reproducibility which we already talked about and it's the goal was to program to accomplish a task or answer a question.  I could do this so you can look over what is expected of a data scientist will be doing a number of those things in this course, but not all of them.  Okay, let me give you guys a minute to transition here. You'll want to open this link. If you have an earlier version of flies. I put the wrong link on the side and you will need to request permission. You'll need your UCSD email address to access this if you don't have a computer that is okay. We'll be walking through this notebook in a minute or two.  Chopin's who was able to access a link. I'm a little nervous about the Wi-Fi in the room. Do you have the link open?  Set bit. Ly cos 9 underscore programming.  They be trying to access it and doesn't have it open yet.  a lot of people getting their clients practice  cuz you need to use your UCSD email or Gmail account.  Hey buddy, still trying to access that's having trouble a few.  Is it because you're using your Gmail or cuz?  And I saw this for just a second.  I tried to change the settings so that you could use it. Even if you were not using UCSD, but it's not working.  Okay, bring it started you won't need access to it. But hopefully we can work these things out for next time. So feel free to let me know what issues you're having after today's class. So this is what you'll see on your collaborator notebook to edit. You'll need to copy a link in BIO need to make a copy into your drive. So you would go into file and then say copy in Drive.  So am I in this is what it looks like just the color is going to look a little different and I'm going to present it as flies. The slides are also available on Triton Ed. So this is a jupyter notebook. That is very similar to The Notebook that you're using here.  and  each day that we do programming. There's going to be the electric part and then there should be a programming part and I'm going to give you guys time to follow along at at the code see what happens to the program. Today. We're going to discuss two variables variable naming different types of operators and variable types.  So we talked about this a little bit before but you those collaboratory at documents you using for your assignments are jupyter notebooks and their way to combine code that you can excuse to get the output of the code and text into a single file.  Cells are the operational unit within a jupyter notebook and they are independent. So you can write code in a cell and to run if you hit shift enter or go up to the top and click run and they can be used for writing different things either text for code.  super example, this is a Marcum cell so I can go in and edit this in the middle of class and  This is all normal markdown. I can make it.  Italic by using the markdown that we talked about last class and then I hit shift enter and now it's reflected in my jupyter notebook.  Hotels work very similarly. So you would see the number for the cell which tells you the order in which the cells will we run the numbers for the lines of code. What we have here is a variable name on the left and then the value stored within that variable. We're going to discuss variables in a little more detail and then print just says to show you what is stored within variable name and the same thing I can edit this.  variable to equal 7  and then print variable to a membership enter Then runs it and we can see both print statements that we've stated. We see the output of that.  Taping works for numbers so you can operate on them and will get back to you how to do this in a little more detail. But if I find a tad the value one and be to have the value of 3 if we add them together and assign it to the variable C and we print see we get the answer of 3 + 1  I said this out loud, but I wanted to make sure you all had it in the notes the numbers in the square brackets to the left of the cell. So these numbers tell you the order in which the cell type and run and ask her if it means that it's currently running and you don't need to run Sal's & Order this for people who haven't written code and notebooks before tend to be somewhat unintuitive so I could go right a hundred five different cells. I can create a variable in the hundred V cell and then go back to V cell and that will be available. So they don't have to be running order everything store in the environment that you run and you don't have to run to cells in order to have the variable of available.  Can't we talk about this in lecture? Your code should have comments. What does actually looks like in a notebook means that for that code. I just wrote here. I would say Define variables and hear complete calculation again for simple code. It's not as essential as when you start doing things that are more complex during urinalysis.  Okay, for those of you have an open you should go back to what we've already done edit things change things run code. So change variable names change what's included in the variable run those cells and if you are stuck as a neighbor or if they don't have this open on their computer. I'll give you guys a few minutes to test the running the code out.  If you requested access you should not have it.  another few seconds for those  I did anybody make any changes that created errors that they weren't able to figure out.  I've been using this term variable and that's what's on the left hand side of the equal sign button programming variables are think that store values to actually Define it and they're to find with this you have the name of the variable and then the value stored in a variable.  And just to be very clear variables in programming are not the same as variables in math and code. The equal sign is used for assignment in math. It's to evaluate quality. So just keep in mind. Just give me the same or it doesn't have the same meaning.  and there are  Rules for declaring variables the variable name is always on the left hand side. It's on the right hand side variables are case sensitive. So a if you write capital c with lowercase a t and an all lowercase e a t those are two different variables and it must always start with the letter variable 10 include numbers and underscores, but they cannot include special characters and python doesn't care how you name your variables, but humans do care and we talked about that and lecture.  The good Berry Bowls have good names. This is a radiation from lecture. But I wanted to drive Point home. Now that we can see it in the form of actual code in a notebook here. If we assign these four values to H.  That doesn't really give you any insight into what those are whereas Heist using the same four variables. You now know that these are individuals Heights.  If you have a background in our or Matt left one thing that can cause you problems with the fact that python is 0 indexed. So we're talking about that same variable Heights with the story that was for values. The first value is accessed using the syntax tree of Heights open square brackets and a zero this the output of this is 65 the first value following along if you wanted to access the second value, that would be a 1 and she wanted to get the last value you would start from the end where this would be -1. This isn't here just for anybody who's more familiar with our or Matlab which happens to be one side and 0 indexed.  Okay, I'll give you a few minutes ago. What time on this one play around change of variables the names change the output is seed to make sure you understand the concepts of indexing and naming.  I got a few seconds.  Are there any general questions about this car?  I showed you go before that use an arithmetic operator, but I wanted you to find them here and you can add the values within a variable and also subtract multiply divide 2 multiply you use an Asterix to divide a flash into exponentiate something you would use to Asterix together with no space.  So you can use it as a calculator. You can specify a value here where it would add the two of them together, but you can as a shirt before assign values to variables and multiply them together and get the output same for division.  So those are athletic operators they carry out the math you would expect them to carry out.  But there's another set of operators that are really important when you are carrying out now fees and those are relational operators or comparison operators. I'm so if you want to know if two variables are exactly equal to each other you would use a 8w equal sign remember a single equal sign would be for assignment to a variable this checks whether or not variable a is equal and contains the same information as variable. This one here. Is it! Or bang equal sign is not equal to that says a is not equal to be the rest of them should look familiar from the math course, so you have little less than and greater than and less than equal to or greater than and equal to.  So we assign variables and a 285 and be to have the value of 2 if we were then to ask whether or not a is exactly equal to be that would be false because these guys are not the same somewhere late. We know that 5 is not less than or equal to 2 so these produced false. These are called billions where to find those in a second alternatively a is not equal to be so that is true or a is greater than they also true. So conditional operators are didn't give you either true or false out as a response.  I'll give you guys a few seconds test without make sure you can predict what the so if you change the values around on a pier make sure you know, what the Apple over here. You can change those using different conditional operators.  Give you guys a few seconds for that.  You're not a few seconds any questions on arithmetic operators or conditional operators?  Okay, go back to him talk about today for today are variable types. There are lots of different variable types in Python were only discussing the few that will likely be most helpful to you in doing your assignments and other data scientist. So it support another every variable has a type and it refers to what is stored in a variable and how the computer stores that data. So for example, if I say that my variable name stores the value one, you can always use type with an open parentheses around the variable name and it will return what type of variable is stored in that variable.  So this is storing an integer.  Integer store unsigned whole numbers just like the integer you expect from a math course.  so if I assign values to these two variables  I thought I had made it back here and then do type.  Another integer, it will return that it is an integer.  What are also numbers that they allow for Stein so far whether positive or negative and decimal points?  Same thing here a sign both 1.0. This is now float because we specified that there is a decimal place and this is now a float because it has a negative so it's signed and because it has information about decimals.  Sawgrass what type are those are floats?  Wrapping a few more strings Orchestra characters as text. These are bowstrings. They process type of the variable categorical variables, which will talk about next lecture 10 to restring a Bolens we talked about these it's either going to be true or false. These are the what gets returned from a conditional comparison.  Same process the last thing or none often in a data sets. We have enemies and our data and we need to know that that date is intentionally not there and hasn't been accidentally deleted. So we need to have some way of storing the concept of none and so in basic python, that's none will talk about how I'm pandas pandas that which is a little different in a layer lecture.  I only have tax benefit you guys are going to answer you. I just want to the last Parker helpful if you've never coded in python python before so if your function and you want to pull up the documentation, you can always add an? To the end which will fill it up.  This next part is really important. If you have recorded before there's tab complete capabilities. So if you are start typing the name of a function, but can't remember what it is. You can hit tag within the cell with energy for Notebook and it will give you the possibilities are so play around with complete.  and all you guys go  hurry up this year. "
