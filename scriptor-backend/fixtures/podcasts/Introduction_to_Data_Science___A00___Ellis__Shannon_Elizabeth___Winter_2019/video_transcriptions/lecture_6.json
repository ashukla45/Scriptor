    "Full Transcript": "Everybody we took a quick announcement for y'all before we get started. I'm Rachel. I must Unison at the study abroad office. I just want to come in and talk a little bit about study abroad for those of you who might not know or just some more information for you to get so I want to see who here is interested in studying abroad. Okay, how many more Hansel. After this because it's really a life-changing special experience and and you can really fit into your schedule. And anyway that you want to so you can go for any kinds of academics you could go for your major minor ge's or elective. So whatever you want to do to fit it in there for any length of time so you can go over a summer or of course this semester at 4 full year for that really immersive experience. And then it's also very financially affordable, which a lot of students don't really know so you can get it covered by financial aid here at UCSD or there's also a ton of scholarships that are just open to UCSC student. I'm studying abroad. So I really recommend you all take it out the website. It said you brought that ucsd.edu and then our offices in Matthews cotton. Thank you. I say just heard about 30 broad Sean just asked me if I studied abroad and I just told him that that was like my biggest regret of undergrad with that. I didn't study abroad cuz I was playing sports. So I so I think you should at least look into it. If you're at all interested as we get settled the reminders appear. Your first assignment is due tomorrow right before midnight. You should all be in group by now. You've had three weeks to do it you had Piazza to use I reach out to those of you who are struggling to get group. I haven't heard back from most of the people I reach out to I'm assuming that means you were in groups as you had time to do it. Your third reading is due next Friday. Let's settle down this announcement is because I was not that clear about the notebooks and what how we use them in class last class. I want to make sure I'm more clear this time. So the notebook and you'll be using today is that this URL bit. Ly 06 underscore data when you click on that?  It will look maybe something like this that is not where you're going for you want to be able to open it with laboratory, which is an app that is connected to this when you click on the suggested at Oakwood collaboratory. You'll see something.  That looks like this these have all the notes and the code that I'll be showing on the slides that I prevent. They just look slightly different. So I'm having you that you are trying stuff with in the laboratory notebook, which you might hear me call a jupyter notebook. I mean this document cuz this is what you have access to and what I'll be presenting are the slides that just have slightly different coloration have all of the same information that are at the LINQ bit. Ly 06 underscore data. The second point I want to make about your notebook is the fact that this isn't entry level course. There is no expected prereq for programming that said a lot of you have a lot of programming experience so I can't just skip over that material for those of those people in the course. You have not cover this, but if you open this link scroll through and you're like, I know all of this information already uncomfortable with it, or you're would rather spend the time later looking at it on your own what I will tell you.  You always get a jupyter notebooks at the end of the lecture will always be that transition. Between the lecture material and the notebook. So if you feel comfortable material has somewhere else you'd rather be think you could spend a time better offer. That is fine. You can head out. When we do that transition. That is no problem. There will be no clicker questions in the programming portion. So you'll be extra kind of part won't be affected about that when we transition into the notebook at the end of the lecture you're free to go if you look through any like I know all of this time comforter with all of this, you're also welcome to stay if you're comfortable with it to get a review. You're welcome to stay if you want clarifications, if you would just rather stay here during it. Oh, that's fine.  the questions there  But I mentioned that sometimes we're going to start with refresher questions to test your cumulative knowledge of what we've gone over already.  So we're going to go to questions in the beginning. So let's get your iclickers out.  Frequency code is AD also up on the board.  There are people able to click in.  Should be able to so the question is in the Facebook starting. This is one for the ethics lecture. Remember this is what you saw on your newsfeed. Did it affect the status you wrote later on. What did the authors of the study not receive from their subjects?  And I have heard a few more seconds.  3 2 1  okay, fire March everybody remembers that they did not receive informed consent. So this was debatable because there were academic institutions that use the data but it was not an academic institution. That was a company Facebook a private entity that collected the data so largely it was agreed that they did not need informed consent to run the study but there was a debate amongst the community after the fact  Alright, the next one is from the Version Control lecture. I'll let you read all the options are very similar. But this is a tougher question. So it's for a project to what you were making changes in a repository that you've been working on. What would be the process for getting those changes you've made locally on to get Hub to take a look at before options?  I don't close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  I to buy a large every remember everybody remembers that after you've made changes. The first thing I have to do is stage then which is used using git add you then commit them so that you get that snapshot and you add your commit message that point and then you push them to get help and all the changes are recorded there.  Asus questions mostly so that when you are studying for the first exam you have some idea of what you remember and what you don't as we go through this next one is purely for my own interest as an intro class. We have people with lots of different backgrounds different years in school different nature so my cat and my curiosity is amongst a designs FX reproducibility replicability control programming what percentage of the information presented so far has been new to you.  And I have no idea what this is going to turn out today.  I'll give you a few more seconds.  3 2 1  alright, so it is pretty even which is kind of the goal. And an intro course that you have a lot of people who are never hearing these topics enter. This is the first time and everything's new to them where you have some people who have seen or heard most of this before. So I think this is a pretty good distribution for what I was expecting but I really wasn't sure that was mostly for my knowledge and wipes where to be working with and talking about and using examples of analysis. So it's really important that we get some definition on what data are where they're stored how they're stored and the characteristics between the different ways in which they're stored.  So what start with a definition of data their lost out there the one we're going to go with is anything that can be stored on a computer.  What does it mean for to be data that it has to be on a computer but it could be stored on a computer. So if you do an experiment and write down the data and the results in your notebook those are data because they could be stored in a computer. So anything that can be stored on a computer or data.  Have a number of examples of peer of what could be data. So it could be a measurement of height. So that's pretty clear the data if I collect all of your Heights and turn them into computer if we know that those are data but the texts and emails you sent our data all the audio files in your Spotify account are data and any that you can take a list of all the things in your closet and those would be data. So if you can enter it into a spreadsheet which are the type of data will focus on his course take a picture of it right about it make a video of it recorded on audio. It's probably data. So we're using a very liberal definition of what data are which makes sense when you think about the fact that data are everywhere.  Okay. So when were talking about how we store data we store them in variables and so their values that we store in a variable types of variables. So one or continuous so these are quantitative. These are numbers. So Heights would be an example of this and they can either integer is in the python world or floats and turmeric. I want to make a correction to something I said last lecture that was incorrect. I said that integers were unsigned in Python that is not true integers are whole numbers but can be positive or negative and thanks the students who made me realize I made that mistake by continuous variables are numbers.  What type of variable are categorical or quantitative measures so these are things that we should be stored in a text like a Stringer character. They're also type in the pandas. My brother will be using call categorical more talking about a categorical variable. This is one where those are limited number of options. So something like measuring a variable of whether not somebody with a minor or an adult are only two options are either at less than 18 years old or their greater than or equal to 18 years old and they would be either a minor or an adult. So it's a categorical variable when there's a limited number of possibilities that any observation any individual you said he could take  Okay, so you really got his home? We'll test a few of these if I've measured your height and entered into a spreadsheet as 68.2. What type of variable would this be?  I'll give you a few more seconds. People are clicking and pretty quickly.  3 2 1  I hope we start with an easy one. This is an example of a slope because there is a decimal place here and it is a numeric. This is a quantitative variable.  Next one day 300 species of Iris flower. This is a picture of an iris what type of variable would species be in this case?  I'm going to close it in a few seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so people mostly answered C or D. I would accept both it is a categorical variable as there's a limited number of possibilities, but it would also be a strain depending upon how you coded in Python C&D would work for that variable.  Look at that one for now. Okay, see how variables they're generally either quantitative or qualitative.  The way we then store multiple variables in a single data set varies, by the way, we structure it.  So I'm going to start today by talking about structured data that are semi-structured data stares at these are those tabular data even talking about spreadsheets for your rows and columns and sells like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or Google Sheets will touch on Json and XML files and how those are semi structured. We won't be working with them directly in this course. We're going to be really focused on working with spreadsheets going to talk about what those look like. So you're at least familiar with them. I'll spend a little bit of time talking about what type of data and how we store it when it's structured so structured data or those data that are in a relational database will talk about what that is like a SQL database.  The last type or unstructured data and the really great definition there is just everything else. So if it's not unstructured a semi-structured or structured it's unstructured. So these are your videos or audios audio files images website apps text and we'll focus a little more heavily today on those just because it'll probably be the one of the only times we talked about unstructured data a ton.  Questions on the differences between generally cuz we can talk more specifics on semi-structured structured or unstructured categories.  So we're talking about semi-structured data the most commonly with the most common way that data scientist store semi-structured data are in CSV file share file for all the information that you need our present if you were open this up in a text file. So will you see here are columns that are separated by a, that's where the name comes from, separated. So we have one two three columns each separated by, they have the extension. CSV and each row is separated by a new line. You're probably more familiar working with these types of files when they are read into Microsoft Excel her into Google Sheets. When you read those same data in from the CSV, they order themselves nicely in rows and columns.  So talk about tabular data or talking about data that looks something like this where you have columns and then Rose.  We will be talkin lots and lots about spreadsheets and tabular data and we will have a whole lecture on how to work with them. So we're not going to focus a tunnel now. I just want to make sure you knew there was one example of semi-structured data the next time we talk about our Json data, which are based on key value pears. And these are necessary hierarchical and we'll see that on the next slide why that's the case when we talk about keys and values Isabel would be belonging to the key names of this is the key. I pair which is Jason has this curly racket around in a colon separating them.  So you don't just have one piece of information on when you're storing it you would have a bunch of information stored in a Json file. This is a snapshot of some Yelp data. So you the reason why I said are nested or hierarchical is because here all of this fits underneath attributes and all of this fits under good for and you can see the nested structure in there. So you see lots of key value pairs where this place is not good for dessert or late night or any of these categories, but it is a drive-thru restaurant and there is free Wi-Fi display. So you can start to get information about each of the entries in the Shell Faded by looking at the structure the nested a hierarchical so there different levels and things nested within each of them making up the hierarchical structure of a Json file.  Similarly, there is SML SML is also an effing hierarchical structure. It just looks different than Json if you are familiar with HTML, it is similar to HTML and that you have tags opening and closing different portions of your data. But here you get to Define what the tags are what you don't get to in HTML there their specified so their nose and tags at elements within HTML. It's still nest in hierarchical. The format is just different than Jason where you don't have his key value pairs instead you have nodes Define with the seller sign and then tags and an element.  Okay, that's all I'm going to say about Jason X and all that's not a time. So that won't be the focus of this course. I just wanted you to know I seen it to have heard the word to know that they're semi-structured.  I will be sending a bit of time talking about how we work with relational data cuz it's an important concept when you are working with you because you often have to relate data to one another and join them and we'll talk about you going to talk about relational databases. These are databases places where you store a bunch of tables that are interdependent on one another.  So if you have a lot of information about a single entity, you would store them in an efficient way using a relational database and I'll show you what I mean by that relational databases allow you to avoid ambiguity. So there's always an identifier that is unique to an entry. So you're always positively sure who you're talking about based on that ID and it allows you to increase data privacy. So if you got a big company of a big database tons of data, you might not have access to all of it and you can be given access to the parts of the database. I'm to which you need access.  What I mean by independency is 73 tables each one stores a different bit of information. They will each have a column that allows you to know that this wrote this row. I miss her all about the same observation the same forgot about places. So they're all related to one another by this identifier.  So if we expand that out and actually look at the information if we have three tables in a database one about the restaurant so we have some information about where that restaurant is. And what type of restaurant is you some information on health inspection. So we have the name of Russian of the ID the inspection date who did the inspection in their score and is the rating on the name ID number of stars from a distance from Yelp. This comes from the health inspection database in this comes from over all the restaurants in a location. They are all related to each other face on their ID so that consistently let you know that this place is the same place here that has been inspected twice by different people and if they have a 4.8 stars in the rating system, so that identifier that has to be you need to a place in the reason that matters is because if you have two places named the same thing with different identifiers, you know that these are different restaurants in this case today identifier is the what's most important. So you need to know what that is when you're working with a relational database what you should be merging on.  So this is an example of a database that is often used when you're teaching people to work with relational databases. We're going to just look at parts of it when you're talkin about databases. Each of these individual ization are different tables, but you can see that in this case. We're talking about music generally or sit there like here we're going to talk today about the tracks and the album The Artist so you can see the artists are linked to albums based on the artist ID. So that information is found in both of those tables an artist would be linked to tracks by I believe album ID and I case you can see where all the links are which allows you to then work between all of these and combine information across table so that you can get a dataset to work with  I mentioned we're just going to focus in on two tables and just parts of those tables to start understanding how you 50 stay together. And the fact that you often want to put information together that are stored in Separate Tables when you're working with relational data. So here. Artist I mentioned already that it is linked to the album table by artist ID. So that information is in both of them and artist contains the name the artist and album contains all the names of the albums that each artist has produced.  Okay, so if we look at a few rows in each of these artists and album, you can see here a few artists and here a few albums that each of them has proposed and then you had produced and then you have artist ID.  There are a number of different ways that you could join the data and it's important to understand the difference between these joints. So I'm going to depict it and then show you a few cases where I want you all to figure out how the data have enjoyed the ways of the work is the rose that come from artist will be colored blue the rose that come from albums will be red and the rose used to join in the type of driver doing well being green. I walk you through this example, you can see here when we're doing an inner join. We're going to include any roads that were in both tables that were joining SO3. This artist ID is not got over here. And for this artist ID is not found over here.  The resulting table that you get from an inner join would only include those and trees that had been found in both tables initially.  So you care about the overlap between them and only those that overlap you would use an inner joint.  Alternatively if you wanted all of the rows in this first table you specify you would use a left join. So the table on the left you would then say I want any of these are show up over here pull those from the second table and join on those.  If we do a left join, you can see it. All these roads are showing up.  But we don't have information about Aerosmith's albums on the right hand table. So then anyways are filled in so we'll just fill in that that information was not included on the right hand side and give you information Messing.  The opposite of a left join is a right Joy. And if you understood left join, this is very similar the table on the right that you specify you would take all of the Rose in that second table and if those exist then those would be with any resulting table. So you can see here you have all of the artist ideas that were in the right hand table and where Jagged Little Pill is here that artist was not listed over here. So that information is filled in as an NA.  So so far inner join and hero found in both left every row found the first table right every row found in 2nd April 4th. Join that were going to talk about today. Our is a full join and this would be what we haven't talked about yet any row found in either table would be in the resulting table.  And then you would have those anyways filled in for places where information wasn't in the other one. So you're going to have all of the Rose 1 2 3 and 4. All those artists IDs are in the table that you get after the joint.  Early this summer. This is just if you have table accent table why the greatest show up now? I know on the slides there's a gray and I will dark in that gray for the future. So I'm not going to leave us up cuz it's really doesn't help you at all. But I want you all to review think about this for joints and then we'll be to clicker questions for you to assess what type of joint happened between The Davids I'll give you guys a few minutes chat with each other understand to the joints and then we'll assess.  Pick up at 9.  I'll give you another bottle.  Alright, we'll bring it back together.  Are you there any confusion about those four types of joy that we talked about?  Alright, so the first task will be to look at these there's a lot to take in what we have are two tables on the left and then the result of the joint over here. So take a look about what's going on here. Look at the results and table over here and then take your guess as to what type of joint occur Define what we just talked about.  Sorry.  Thanks, okay, if you already cooked and make sure it's registered this time. Sorry, thank you. Thank you.  I will give everybody a few more seconds.  3 2  1  All right time for that and a better. Okay, so that's going on here what clued you in from what you saw in the resulting table?  Great. Okay. So this last one here and I'm from the second table is over here where there's not information up here, but there are people in here who are not including the resulting. So that's how you know that it's in fact a right choice.  All right.  Will do one more take a look and figure out what type of doing. So it's the same idea here is your last table here to write and the resulting join table.  more seconds  I 3 2 1  I told most of you got to correct that is enough that it is a full join cuz all of your information in both tables is there are sometimes we have any kids cuz we don't have the information in the second table and something we have any is cuz that's not included in the first could work on that.  We sent a little bit of time talking about the three types of semi-structured data three most popular. So so tabular data, Json and XML we spend time here now talking about how did our stewards generally in a relational database and how they relate to one another we're going to spend the rest of electric force in time on talking about unstructured data and just generally how it can be used in analysis cuz there are lots of different types of unstructured data cuz it's everything else so they could be text. I also just walls of text a whole book a whole set of books would be a type of data and all the words in it could be a day of that are stored on websites are applications images video audio files will walk through a few examples of these today.  The first I'm not going to talk about too much cuz I do have a lecture on text analysis, but I want to make sure that you had some idea of how you would analyze text. So if you had a newspaper all of the words and that our data or cut the newspaper or from the time it started in Britain until today all of those are data as well and you could take a look at those were that they how many of them in their appositive how many of them are negative and how many of them are neutral and this is a simple way to analyze text and it's called sentiment analysis. We talked on this before when we looked at that post that I was talked about in the reproducibility and replicability lecture.  And it's only going to use an example of Jane Austen's Corpus. So Jane Austen is a famous writer and she has written lots of novels. If you were to take all of those texts across her novels and analyze them from the beginning of the book to the end of the book. You could then measure the sentiment in each of those portions of the book as you walk from the beginning to the end and that's what we're fighting here based on each novel so you don't need to be able to see which one they are. But these are six different novel is being represented from the beginning of the novel to the end and very positive score represents and positive negative sentiment in around 08 neutral so you can quickly at a glance get a sense for the fact that in Mansfield Park. It's got a little bit of negativity going on here toward the middle and then a lot for the end where lots of Jane Austen's books are generally overwhelmingly positive. If you're familiar with her books, that's not wholly surprising and something where they have ups and downs throughout. This is just an example of how you can.  A ton of texts and summarize six full novels in one plot and get a sense of the sentiment throughout the course of the novel The type of unstructured data at the beginning. You just had words you had a novel and you have multiple novels and at the end you're able to figure out something that you didn't know at the beginning about that information.  I'm the second example. I'm going to talk about his web scraping a few of you come up to meet interested in web scraping their articles online. We won't be talking about the steps of this in lecture. But this is an example where they walk you through just a few lines of python code. See you would be able to reproduce what you saw here. And the data from this come from website. We are using a political examples just so I can show you the way in which the text came out of it. So this is an opinion piece from The New York Times in 2017 called provocatively Trump's lies and the information sort of them mostly just a wall a text. So this is what the piece look like where you had a date you had some quote from Donald Trump and then you had to parenthetical phrase explaining why what he said was a lie, and then you could click on this and now it take you to the URL where there was more information about that parenthetical statement below text and the New York Times posted this phone text and its peace.  Summarize the data a little bit. So this is the beginning of Donald Trump's term and one of their headlines of Toronto public lies or false is everyday first first 40 days. So if you look at these calendar, you can see that everyday up until the beginning of March. He told a public falsehood or Public Library public lice something more extreme. They Define he's an ear piece and they summarize information a little bit using that type of flat or this one here where they follow the same line of thought but his his words changing over time. So when talking about when China stop manipulating its currency according to Donald Trump April 21st from the time he took office eight days later. It was during the election a stop a day after that is as soon as he got elected a day after that. He said it was since he started running and the last one for 3 days after that was since I've been talking about currency manipulation. So not really pinpoint at any point relative to his candidacy or time in office.  Secondary source examples, but if you wanted to analyze the whole entire Corpus of it, you couldn't really just look at this wall text.  Will you can do is try and pick out the pieces of information that are stored in that wallet text if you think about each one, they were really four piece of his pieces of information for each why there's the date of Allied. I was at Orange reddish color piece does the Y itself that quotation there's a brief explanation the parenthetical in parentheses of why it was a lie, and then there was a URL at that links to so you would want to collect all of that information.  What what like this if you went to New York Times website, there is HTML behind all of that and you don't need to know the details of this but I'll tell you what that for each record. So each why there are different ways that you can indicate and pull it out based on what you see here. So for example, that is always between strong and the lies and after that and then you have the URL always comes after a trap based on how HTML works and then is the explanation. So as long as you know, how it's structured you can scrape this website and pull out the pieces of information you want.  So we'll be out there. That's why I posted that and you can see some python code here where they capture the date the live explanation and URL and put it into an object called records.  This is what that looks like. So for each record, you have surprised he doesn't open up in each part is separated by a, this is not really visually of all that helpful for us to work with you really want it to be a movie called tag dataframe. So he uses the pandas library that will be in class to get it into this easy to look through and scan and analyze data set. We have all four piece of information in columns and each lie in a row.  So the data started as an information on a website if a wall attacks were then able to get it into a dataset that you would be able to analyze so that's the idea behind web scraping you exploit the HTML and the structure of the data on the website to get the information you want out.  All right. So we talk about a wall of text. We talked about text analysis from the Jane Austen images at all. But I'm sure you're all familiar with the fact that Google has taken images of pretty much everything.  So this is an image from Google from right outside this building.  And a few years ago. It was reported that Google Street View can reveal how your neighborhood votes.  So what day before in this article was that researchers working with 50 million street view images from over 200 cities they were developed to our them. So that's what's important in this piece. We're going to break down a little bit what they did. They did take a ton of Google images and their first goal was to look in that image determine. Is there a car and that if there is a car what type of car is it down to the make model the body type and the H and I think that it color to  So the first goal we had to take all these images state. Is there a is there a vehicle and what type of vehicle is it the first?  This piece didn't explain that they didn't just use Google Images. They also took product images from the website of actual car companies and they had some really high-quality photos to then train their algorithm to better detect the types of cars. So they use Google Images, but they also had like really good pictures of each make model and year of car.  And I didn't hear was they could then have a dataset. We're from different cities. They knew where the car came from and what types of cars there were and you can see the different types of information. They detected from each of these images and each car.  Cuz I really want that was step one. They needed these images and they need to know where they came from. The second one was they took census data and 2008 election data and they then try to use the images build a model that would allow you to say from the type of car that there can we predict income level or racial makeup educational attainment and voting patterns based on what cars are there?  And they made the argument and this is a result from their paper. I should have the link to the bottom but it went on the other side not a very intuitive image. So what I've strong here are the fact that what actually happened in 2008 is here. So who they voted for in different parts of the country are in red or blue and what they predict on the right and what they're the reason they showing this is cuz they largely match one another.  Any person that they did they took images they build a model they trained and then said how would we actually do based on what happened?  And they claim the proportion of pickup trucks to sit and the precinct and are about a thousand residents determines whether residence there lean Democratic or Republican.  So my question to you is would this approach work for the 2012 election? That was Obama's second term or the 2016 election that voted Donald Trump. What do you think?  Feel free to chat with each other.  Save this time.  a close in a few seconds  at 3 to 1  Show me a people kind of across-the-board and I'll tell you that I don't know the answer for sure to this. I haven't seen you in Alice's redone. So I'm curious to see what your thoughts were behind choosing each of these cuz these people in all the cans.  Who wants to defend their position?  Something like the increasing weeks of March are Services of people are less likely to purchase a new vehicle or used vehicle at all.  More more difficult because car sharing become so popular that it doesn't really pinpoint you to who you are based on what car is there cuz you could be using Lyft or Uber. I think that's a great point.  Okay. So another great point so the point for the back and you couldn't hear it was that we think it could work because they divide between rural and urban has continued to grow and urban areas tend to vote for Democratic and roll 10 to vote online more Republican any other thoughts.  Okay, so I'm going to add my own two cents here. So we know that a lot of places flipped it from 2012 to 2016 and who they voted for in the model was trained based on what was happening earlier on and we'll talk about training data and algorithms in a later lecture. My guess is that it would work pretty well in 2012, but less well in 2016 the authors on recognize this limitation but this is something they certainly could test and improves our model prediction accuracy and we'll talk about how to do that in later lecture. So I would say be is my guest. But again, I told you I don't actually know cuz they didn't do it as far as I know.  One of the additional examples I want to talk about is a simple one where we went to figure out how similar are audio files are to each other. So you could imagine that to listen to a ton of audio files and then figure out what's going on with them and how early do they are to each other is non-trivial. So somebody said out in a blog post just to see how their music tastes cluster and their question was Kennedy similarities. Just Between the audio Spectrum. So this is the frequency of the song. I'm across from the beginning with Za until the end and the distribution of bad to find songs that are similar to each other. Is that enough?  So there is no other people who set out to dislike. You know that you are on Spotify recommended songs that are similar based on preferences. So he went to a database where this information exists but it's a combination of a lot of different factors. Not just that Spectra and he said okay, I have just saved this favorite song nine million bicycles. I'll play a little bit for it and he looked to see in what's known out there. What are the most similar song to this song?  What is the 22nd?  like the song  so he took those results come with information that exists out in the world and he got this date of it. He said it back and he said okay the songs rated most similar. So the closer to one you are the more similar there a tattoo songs by that same Artist as very similar, which is not wholly surprising and then he looked across all of the songs and found one that was voted less than Allure and then when I was even less similar are we going to listen to that song? But he said let me throw into other songs Poker Face by Lady Gaga and No One Mourns the Wicked from the Wicked musical and he said we would assume that there was would not be very similar if you know the songs and listen to want a man to this query song.  Give it to Phil Spector summarize them and then cluster then so for those who have not looked at a question that before the closer they are and the bees are branches the more and more close. They are in Space. The more related. They are based on their Spectrum. Any further you are from the query song. So here's a query song. The less similar you are out here is that was first to songs by the artist are put next to each other. But this was the next most similar songs. How does that relate to listen to a few of these? So ever? Remember the first song refresher similar from that?  sisters  Okay, so I kind of agree that that's that's similar this song was rated as not very similar based on that first album that use that he's now looking just at the audio Spectra. So, this is Norah Jones Come Away With Me  Come Away With Me  I'm pretty similar. It makes sense that they would be together. This was the song initially thought that was very similar to listen to this. Is that same as that first artist?  Call monsters.  Okay, so that's a little Jazzy or a little more trumpets going on in that one and then for just west similar.  Okay.  So with that, I think we can see.  But there are different information. You can clean whether or not you're looking at audio Spectre or if you're looking at a bunch of factors together and I would suggest that really the three that cost her most similar in his analysis were the three most okay that said  I'm going to be talking about this example and asking you through it before I move onto this any questions about the examples. We've talked about this far.  So the pudding is a website that makes really beautiful awesome visualization state of visualizations. And they make these data essays check them out. I'm sure there's something on there that you're interested in going to talk about the one that was title are pop lyrics getting more repetitive and the author States the following I'll be analyzing the repetitiveness of a data set of 15,000 songs that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1958 and 2017.  So my question to you is what kind of data would you need to use to answer the question that he proposed are pop lyrics getting more repetitive.  Close in a few seconds.  3 2 1  okay, so by and large most people said text and that's correct. You would need to look at the words in the song. So the lyrics to determine whether or not they're getting more repetitive you could go through and listen to all these songs that you would probably be doing that for a very long time. So text is what you would want for this.  But in dictionary text you need to know how you're going to measure repetitiveness. So this is something that is commonly a question. I have to ask when you're asking questions. You have to figure out what do you need in order to answer your question? How do we determine repetitiveness an example of two different songs? Both of these songs have 52 words and 23 different 52 is 52 worth long and has 23 total unique work. You can clearly see that see you song is much more repetitive. You have exact same line. I'm being repeated throughout which is not the case on the right hand side. So just going by the number of unique words isn't going to give you a true measure of repetitiveness.  So instead he was evident. You don't even know the details where you're taking the text as you go to the bank at walk you through how he did this and related to the phrase it so you look at each word and then look at the word nearby and as he do we see that whole phrase elsewhere throughout remove those cuz those are repetitive and you get a much truer idea of how repetitive song is and then you can measure how much each song reduces. So if it reduces by 97% it's super repetitive. So over here is around the world by Daft Punk. So that is the most repetitive song. They have here Sia Cheap Thrills most songs on compressed by about 50%  You can then take a look at the data over time. So I'll give you a chance to look at this and I'll have somebody interpret what's going on. If you can't read this that's all songs and blue and this one says top 10 in Orange.  I'd rather thought and what conclusions we can draw from this.  What time is it in 2000 seconds?  What's happening? What's happening in the two?  self  Owen mm what's going on here, okay.  So what's what is what's noticing there?  What do you say?  Okay, so you're looking at these two lines getting further apart from each other. So that's what we're looking at here. So you have years and time on the x-axis and then this is repetition on the y-axis. So ideally that would be more clear and its relation but it says it up here so we can see generally that repetitions going up over time. And what is the difference between blue and orange?  oranges  Okay, so then it's always the top 10 10 to be always more repetitive at all song. So we we humans like repetitiveness. It seems like and they have only been increasing over time and I really like that point in the beginning of what's going on a 2000 cuz she's always been looking at points and graphs that are different from the rest of it and you can see that things start changing their and I don't know the answer to come or more repetitive-loss going to make on this day also summarized by artist where the more repetitive as long as it's goes out this side less repetitive. So for example, Jay Cole's music as if you are much less repetitiveness a Rihanna's  Review, we talked about structured data. We focus on unstructured data. Then the rest of the course will be focusing on semi-structured data. And with that we're going to been open the jupyter notebook. If you're familiar with everything that you are free to leave. You're welcome to stay of course and just to remind you that if you are opening it, it might look like this and you wanted to click on open with Laboratory.  I'll give you two minutes to get that up and running.  I'll give you about another minute.  I will get started as people filing out. So if you could do it so quietly that be great.  Are that's a big data.  Play everything's out. These are the things going to be talking about what we talked about the pandas Library how to read in CSV file how to specifically do that on collaboratory, which you'll need to know for your projects and then we'll talk a little bit about indexing and slicing.  I mentioned that will be using the pandas Library. This is going to be the one that we focus on most in this course cuz it really helps you work with what the data will be working with. So we're talking about libraries and python. These are things that help extend.  Are y'all?  Soda stands what's available by default in Python sitting on is called pandas and it's helpful for data manipulation and Analysis of tabular data.  When you're working in collaboratory or in jupyter notebooks for the Anaconda distribution in men your classes. You already have it installed. So when you're working collaboratory, this is installed it just has to be imported.  So the common way to do this in our turn this off which is why it's not working the way to do this in Python is to import the package and then we use this abbreviation TD. This will be used in lots of places. So I recommend you to this to but anytime you want to access pandas. You just have to type PD you'll see this going forward.  Anytime you want to use pandas you have to do this first.  And you'll be able to Van work with data frames are tied to a data much more easily.  So to read in a CSV file into python, you will use this function. So to specify that were using pandas followed by a. And then read underscore CSV.  This if you run it right now will not work on your computer and I'll explain why so I'll tell you when you'll be able to run the code I'm directly but this is just that we all understand how you read in file. I'm cuz this isn't always explicitly stated when you start working in pi. So here is a variable called population. I assign it again using equal sign and then we have the function p a p d. Reed underscore CSV and then to pass to the file is here and I'm going to explain that so this will have on your computer because you are at your computer would be looking for a file that's not there. But I mean by that is you have to smile specify where your computer should look for the set file.  There are two types of pad relative has an absolute path. The first one I just showed you is a relative path. This is a path from 2 to file from where your computer thinks you are currently an absolute path on the other side. It is a path from the root or the home of your computer. I'll show both examples of both of these go up a directory into the next folder called data and then look for this file fall break this down.  The two. Always best if I go up one directory.  There are things called automatic functions in jupyter notebooks so you can always recognize those by them starting with this % So pwe printer working directory. This is how you find out where your computer thinks you are currently so you can see that my computer. I am in users and then I can't see that they stop teaching cause 9 notebook if I'm here and go up one level. I would then be a cause not if I go up to levels I would be in teaching.  Whenever you're in active directory, you can always with the files that are there so you can see that I have the notebooks for this class in that directory and I do this by using the automatic function OS which will always listen to buy in your current working directory.  So if I wanted to specifically go up one directory and go into the the data directory where this file is stored. I could change directories with another automatic functions of CD go up to use the corporate directory using the two dots and then go into data and now I could then relist those files and you'll see that now the app looks different cuz I'm in a different directory. I have change my directory and you can now see those CSV files that when we were looking for is in that directory.  Okay, that's what I was a package take where I am currently and get to the pot of the file from where I am. The other one is an absolute path. I could specify from my route which starts with this has probably have a tilde there to this would work that would work. Also this specified your home directory.  Doesn't work cuz I didn't actually change directories.  And it brought it.  Don't need to tell their story directory and then you go to buy the entire pass and an end up at the on CSV file.  Okay, so it might seem at this point. If you have noticed that they should always just specify the whole thing as any for sure get to the right place, but you'll know that this will only work on my computer on the on the other hand if you're working on a team and you all have the same file structure set up in your working on it saying that I filed as long as they know where you are you can that use relative has to get to the file. So if you're working and only getting on your computer working on it sure. Set the path and you always get it right, but you can try to work on a different computer. If you try to work with somebody else has dated this is not going to work.  Okay, so I can explain that you always know that when you're not working till I returned your working on your computer, but this is what you're going to need on your computer when you're working in for files in this class. So when you're working until I return you can still get files from your local computer. You can import files that you stored on Google Drive or from URL and we'll walk through each year.  First point is this is not in your jupyter. Notebook. This is just so it's not running cuz this isn't actually any laboratory. So this has been deleted and yours, but you will see this code and it says import Drive which was the library that Google colaboratory has so that you can mount your drive and then you can specify the past to the file with in Google Drive know that this will open an application you have to specify which Google account needed you want to use and then you will copy authorization code into York laboratory notebook, and then you'll be able to access all your file.  So if you wanted to see the files that are in your drive you would use this and if you wanted to read the file in again, it would be pandas the PD read CSV and then the path to the file just as before how to read in a file from Google Drive.  Reading a local file. You have to first click to specifies again. This will not be in your code. It's just here for me. You would run this it would then give you a box to then choose to get how to get to the file. If you run this. You'll see pretty quickly how it works and collaboratory and this allows you to upload a file into collaboratory and then you can use that file for urinalysis.  The last of us really helpful and we'll use infection and if the files whole system on the internet, you can certainly use for your project is to Simply put in the URL within the PD the pandas read CSV file function. Do you justify this? And this is where it will start to work. So if you run this line of code in class, so we went to find file from URL. This will run and you will have access to the data set and then the rest of the code in this notebook will work for you. So the day already be working with is this dataset here. It's the state population. So you can see the state or region is in the First Column the ages column includes whether or not there at that information about individuals under 18 or total everybody. The third one is year and the fourth is the population. So this is tracking state population over time.  So when you first read in the days after you maybe don't want to just look at the first two rows you want to start to get a feel for how many rows are our total. The first thing I know is that how many dimensions it has this is too there's rows and columns often do that for me will always be that for a dataframe but the shape is what will help you. So if you put population that is the name of the dataframe I specify and then use the method shape. It will tell you how many rows and how many columns are you already there at 4, and now we know there are more than 2,000 rows in this data set.  I already showed you this but to remind you often just taking a look at the first few roses helpful and it's the head method that would be helpful that again. It's always the object and a. And then the function.  Is it was first fibros?  I want to point out that you have the index for each row on the left and I mention that python a zero index you see this here. The first row is 0 and then we go down to four which is the fifth row and then the column headers are listed at the top of each,  I may be a second read those a 2in run those commands try and change them around and make sure you're getting the same thing. I'll just give you a minute or so to do this. So you're up to speed when we do the rest of it.  Are any questions as you do that?  I am going to spend just a second talking about data types in pandas.  Here to take type it tells you it's a serious. We won't be focusing too much on that but you can use the decide method to look at a specific column. So here you have population. You specify would call me want to see and then use this by D type and it tells you that year is an integer.  You can do this for the entire dataframe by doing population detox and you can see that all of the types here are specified and it makes sense though.  Year is an integer where a population is a float?  And object is Candice's version of a string.  Replace remind you. We have Rose. We have Colin to that same day. Does that you also want to just get subsets of data outside of a dataframe so you can use the Loft license in Texas. So this tells you which parts of dataframe you want to pull out some example, if we were to specify that same dataframe and then the loc method you would use Open Bracket and say you want to pull out index to and then ararot to and then ages.  If you look up here we're using at 2 index and then ages and that's under 18, which is the output we get from that.  Remind me to call get a single value usually want to pull out whole chunks of data.  Look at that.  So you can pull out a whole column using the syntax.  I'm working on specify population use the loc method and then specify that you want the population and this will give you that entire column of information.  You can operate on you. So if you take that same area code and divided by a million, you can quickly see how many million people there are which was less easy to see when you had the phone number. So here we can see that there's 1.1 million at first row, but some 4.8 million in the second row seating always operate on these using those arithmetic operators. We talked about last lecture.  Answering so that's how to get a single value. But you can also use these two subsets. So why did you only were interested in looking at those cases were ages musical total? You have a bunch of those that have under 18 and have a bunch that are total. You probably don't want them all together. You want to analyze them separately. So you would just want to pull out. Those rows were Ages was equal to total.  The first thing I have to do is determine which rose ages is equal to total. So if you look here you see a boy and sorry for the rose that are for ages Medieval 2 total you'll get true-false otherwise and then you just take this bit.  And then specify that within your indexing. This will do the same. It's just a shortcut.  Look at that then now we can see that we only have Rosemary. Does it equal a total the shortcut here is just removing the last bit here.  I talked about the bed that last message now. There's. I locked the eye there stands for in Dexter rather than using the colonies of the ronan's you can just use the indices. So 01234 both the columns and the name.  I did mention that when we did lock it was in fact that so here it is like basic tython if you use it. It's  It does not include the right endpoint. So here instead of specifying 0 through 5 and you noticed that V index is not included. So include 0 1 2 3 and 4 when you're using ilok.  All right, I'll give you a chance to practice about if you want. I'm here to answer any questions. Other than that, I will see you all on Tuesday. "
