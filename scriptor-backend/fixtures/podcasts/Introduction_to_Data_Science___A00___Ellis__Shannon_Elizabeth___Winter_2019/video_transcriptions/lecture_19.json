I'm sure it's because you're all super excited for our guest lecture today and not nervous about the exam at all, which is great. Note today that your final project is it do on a Thursday reminder? It's not a Friday. If you on Thursday, March 21st by right before midnight and a reminder to complete your capes before 8 a.m. On Monday March 18th. I'll remind you all of that on Thursday also.  We are going to start a clear question. This will Mark as your attendance will do this before and right at the end of Sean's lecture.  one second  All right, so if you're going to go today.  A depression is all of the animals analysis topics. We talked about in France prediction machine learning algorithms text now to the geospatial analysis. How much of that information was new to you. So he's on his three times. This will be the final check in for the information. I was New To You  How can I be a few more seconds to answer that one?  Close the pool in 3.  2  1  I thought everybody tries to find see if there if you appear if you in the middle and they're more over there if you're filtering in.  Let's all focus in Simon introduce you all to somebody who many of you know from touching and all of you should hopefully know that he's one of your teeth and its course. I'm so Sean cross is a grad student in the cognitive science department here and he has an interesting background is going to talk to you all about getting a job in data science, which is the topic Thanos Adventures too many of you and have been asked I've asked about I know a lot of you have asked your teeth and eyes about it. So whatever you do, I'll bring Sean cross up get him hooked up and get his computer started and get you all interested in hearing about data science job.  I'm actually leaving now open.  All right what I was really like.  Where's my mouse?  Great. Okay. Good morning everyone cuz you just coming in there some seats down here for taking the exam. My name is Sean cross. I am a second-year graduate student here in the cognitive science department and up until that point. Also I had been working in various kinds of data scientific rolls still work in that role to a large capacity as a researcher and I talked to a lot of data scientists as a part of my research and so I've seen lots of different paths for people to get into data science careers. I imagine that many of you are looking for internships and data science, maybe your father along your undergraduate career and you're looking for a job after graduation. And so this is  His kind of general-purpose advice. Even if you're not looking for a career in data science, there are many career paths that I've seen folks take out of their undergraduate studies that look like some of the models on the talk about so I'm a part of the UCSD Design Lab here and InDesign. We have this piece of this idea that I really like which is the idea of personas. So a Persona is kind of a strong man or a strong woman like someone who you kind of dream up is in a is in a scenario you kind of sketch out with their background is and then the idea and design is that you design some kind of an interface or an experience or a solution for this kind of persona.  I'm so the first kind of persona that I want to talk to you about today, which you might be able to relate to is what I like to call the typical undergraduate student. Of course, there is no typical undergraduate students. But this is the cookie cutter model that a lot of University career center is least in my experience believe that they are going through in and did they believe have led to success in terms of their to grad students getting jobs after college? So who is who is this Persona 5 Persona 1 they have a little snow relevant experience for a relevant job. So, you know, they're mostly that is the case for many undergraduates. They have a no established professional social network. So, you know, if you're looking to enter an industry or profession, you might know some people in that profession through  Your family or maybe through a couple friends, but you don't have an established reputation in the industry and most of the relevant skills that you are one of a choir for your job. You are acquiring for the courses that you're taking College.  Like six seats down here if you want to come down.  So your persona 1 has a very stringent timeline put out in front of them. Usually, you know, if they're lucky the most lucky Persona ones can grab some irrelevant internship experience after the first summer, although that's that's pretty difficult to do probably the most important stepping-stone is to get some kind of a technical internship during the summer after your sophomore year because of course that's set up that sets up sort of Swing for the fences. I'm going to try to get a major role of an internship in the idea. Is that the experience the expenses from those internships will see you off to a good job after graduation.  So this is all you know, a very happy straightforward cookie cutter kind of story. And so you got a personal one has this issue that which is that since they don't have any contacts in the field. They don't have any relevant experience. They have to somehow get that first relevant minor internship after their first to second gear. And so, of course you should you should prepare a resume if you had several people look at it. You can ask Tas you can ask peers who may be are a couple years ahead of you and and experience but you should expect to fill out and I've been telling us to students in my sections when they ask me and this is their reaction. You should expect to fill out a hundred job applications and that is intimidating and sounds kind of ridiculous. But if you figure with any  If you figured that you get about a 5% response rate in terms of the people who will like it back to you at all with maybe a phone interview with something. You know, you're lucky if one or two of those work out something that you should know about. This kind of a matching problem. Is that in any situation where two people are trying to come to some kind of a mutual match with each other as of the case of hiring this is the success rate for people who are blind jobs regardless of kind of like regardless of of their experience or any personal attributes about them. So it's not it's not  It's not you it's nothing personal but this is just kind of a mathematical laws how these matching situations work. Yeah. I'm having answer the question.  So that's a great question on the question was if what is the best time to start submitting applications? It really depends on when of course was internships like a posted right now is actually something very Primetime like February March sometimes for like the bigger tech companies. They're already opening up their internship applications in the fall. So if you are a freshman or sophomore looking to to get like that that first smaller internship right now is a great time to start looking and start planning to do this.  So so so this is the course right to life seems like unbelievable. But I've seen people do this dozens of times before and as with any major problem, you kind of have vino Persona 1 have to break it down into a system, you know, the the first 20 applications tend to be totally brutal you're figuring out like different systems that people have for applying to jobs different requirements that they have you have to read cover letters and so forth. But after you're over the hump of the first 20 you you've gained the skill of becoming an expert at filling out these job application systems. And so it's a classic 80/20 problem in this case more of a 2018 problem where you know the first 20 really hard because you might be doing something that you've never done before but then the last 8010 to go much more easily and you don't like any major problem as I was saying before you have to break it down into smaller problem. So some people they  Westside a month and they try to do a couple of applications every day and it adds up to 70 80 90 100 job applications don't finish washing is where to enter if you're just going to randomly choose me. I don't mean when a boy to like, you know what you're going to look for jobs online. Where are good places to start one thing I warned you about is that there are scam job applications out there. This is happened to friends of mine where they apply for some job showed up on day one and it was not at all job that they expected based on the application and interview so places that were places where there is not so much like more trust but more transparency into looking into the details of who's hiring you with a job actually requires trying to get in contact to try to get in contact with folks who might work at that.  Company, you know what your course you should look at the University career website. Usually they that the jobs of a post LinkedIn. I'm not like a major fan of LinkedIn as a social network, but it is a central place for companies to post jobs and my experience. It's true, especially locally speaking at least a you know, in in Southern California and Northern California Middle School website called AngelList, which vets jobs to work at startups, which can be a great foot in the door. If you have some skills that maybe you could bring to an early stage company. And so I think you so those are the places that I recommend looking first.  And so when you're finding, you know, there aren't going to be there's not going to be an exact data scientist internship position for your for Persona ones first minor internship. So Persona one should look for lots of different roles as long as they either are Technical and some sense. So in some way touching or writing some kind of code or they involve data and something cents. So you Persona 1 for their relevant minor injury should my look for you know, keyword searches analyst analytics even things like a software developer and software engineer. If you're not, you know, I know that there aren't a ton of computer science students in this in this room, but you still want to put as many applications out there because there's usually some mismatch between what a company says it's hiring for  The team that is hiring an intern really wants and so you you know, if you believe that you have some relevant skills to bring to a team from the classes that you've been taking then then then you should apply or in this case for so no one would want to apply and of course you can also search these jobs looking via looking for skills. So looking for people want python programmers SQL is extremely important. I know that we didn't talk that much of it all. SQL class. But you do if you have skills like JavaScript, you know, if you're really good with Excel, even you know, that that will be looking for jobs and internships are looking for those kinds of skills. Can at least get you a close to working on something to do with data to do with touching code or software Mordor Dewan-Tatum.  So assuming that Persona one gets the major minor irrelevant internship in there after their first or second-year, you know, then it's time after there 30 or it's time to swing for the fences and go for a large Fortune 100 tech companies, you know, spam is a classic Facebook alphabet Apple Amazon Microsoft there. Also, lots of the Fantastic companies near Qualcomm is here Jovi and so forth that regularly employee legally put out formal competitive data science internship positions and most of these big companies recruit on campus and you should absolutely make sure to get in touch with the with the on campus recruiter because they will be the person who can Shepherd your application through the large intern.  process that happened to these major companies  I'm so that was Priscilla one. So Persona one is like a very sort of tried-and-true well-trod past, you know, the Persona 1 approach Works nachos and software but you know, it works in finance. It works in Consulting. It works in marketing and so in terms of like hiring an internships and so forth. It's fairly formalized at the University and at the corporate level.  So now I want to talk about a different kind of persona persona to the technical Hustler and the by Hustler. I want to say that I mean you're not someone who's trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes, but someone who is doing a lot of work on a lot of work outside class in order to build their technical skills. So if you were doing a job where it might be really difficult to share your work product, you know, for example, if you are working in a banking job, it's not like you can take you know banking projects that you've worked on which are usually secret when you're dealing with corporations and show them to employers to demonstrate your skills. And that's the case with a lot of jobs but in  Data science, it's almost like the total the total opposite is true where it's really easy to share the visibility of your technical work. And in fact, this visibility has become really democratize specially with websites like GitHub, but also on people personal websites, basically perform an entire data analysis and shared on the internet and people can look at it. People can look at how you developed it and you can demonstrate your skills. And this know this has gotten to the point where you not only is is possible and easy, but it's actually expected that this is what job applicants are doing in order to demonstrate what they now  So Persona 2, you know, they also have little to no relevant job experience. But some things that differentiate them from one is that they're doing something to work to establish some kind of special Network. I will get into you know what I mean what that work looks like and they are costume on the courses, but they're doing a lot of Independence studying. They're sharing their learning process. They're sharing the artifacts that they're creating through this process and that is part of a portfolio that they're building.  Sopressata to does not have such a golden perfect timeline, you know Persona 2 doesn't necessarily have to even be an undergraduate student or doesn't have to be so early in their undergraduate career that they've already have had all these internships and everything else figured out. So Persona 2 is is much more oriented around the goals that around a timeline. So Persona 2 has a significant web presence, they work on technical projects. They share those projects through I need an online profile like get Hub or through personal website or through a personal blog about their experience creative project demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively. They talk to other data scientist people in in their field online you either through Twitter or through question-and-answer sites or through a forum.  And their relationships with people or their their effort to make relationship of people in this tree doesn't just end online, but you know, they go to meetups they go to conferences and they talk to other people about the war that they're doing and also the work that they would like to do.  So Priscilla to has a we don't know what for someone offers to impeach the 2in to employers. As you know, this this this kind of background in process that employers have seen for in terms of the Earth in terms of that's how they've been recruiting Township undergraduate students. But Persona 2 really has a different set of offers and a set of approaches and it's based around there being evidence of the artifact of their work. So Persona 2 has no evidence of experience in terms of working on data analytic problems through project that they've shared, you know, because Persona 2 does so much waiting is involved in the community their ability to communicate as demonstrated their their technical expertise is is evident.  And it's shown exactly like what kind of skills they have through these artifacts that they're creating and putting online. And so it's clear to employers how they can add value to a team or two company and opportunity to demonstrate domain expertise come back to talking about the main export to use it in a moment.  Sopressata to be ideal Persona 2 as we were talking about the one they find jobs in unless traditional ways. You know, someone might be asking hey, I need I need this kind of person to do this kind of contractual work for me on Twitter and you've been my response to that person and talking about that job. I have seen that happen several times and that's happened to me. They might be at a meet up in person or Converse in person and it's it's the same kind of conversation. I would hop it online but you know having seeing someone in person across multiple times also indicates good things about showing up doing something regularly in and your committee.  And if facility has a proposal portfolio online, then you know what? They might have a contact me page saying, hey, I'm looking for work and get Hub have an indicator on your profile if you're looking for work and you know, ideally through their through the reputation that they're building an artifact that they're putting online the war comes to them. But you know, what if they're developing a a good enough reputation and they're able to demonstrate that are confident at doing some technical tasks, you know, the idea is that is that people actually see the map?  So the question is this up as a versus but realizing outside really what I mean. You just one question as you know, are you a Persona 1 or are you a Persona 2 of course these personas aren't the only options of the other for the kinds of ways to get into data science jobs, but the truth is that you know, nobody in here is completely one of these things and there are lessons to be learned from both personas in order to build towards the career that you would like to have after your undergraduate studies.  Suspected wife, but now I want to talk a little bit about domain expertise and the data science like hiring field as it stands today.  So I searched on cool images for like the most corporate looking pyramid that I could find was just really make any sense. But this is what came up with Sue if you imagined right now. This is you know, it was true. It's it's been through the last couple years that the demand for technical talent in the workplace an industry is just like totally infinite there aren't enough. You know, there aren't enough software developers the word enough data scientists, but lots of people have responded to that the map so for example, you might want to take a look around. This is a photograph of this room on day one and it looks a lot like it does now, you know, the amount of people being trained in data science skills has exploded over the last couple years. So, this is our classroom.  This is an auditorium of this is data 8 at the University, California, Berkeley.  And the point is this. You know, there is now a Groundswell of folks with entry-level data science skills, and you are very likely among those folks. Which on one hand is is very exciting because you know, we're all at the beginning of a new field and we're all at the beginning of kind of a new industrial technical challenge.  Also, how are you going to stand out in the crowd? You know, how are you going to differentiate yourself given the fact that there are so many people interested in this field. And so what I recommend, you know in in management science, there's this idea of the was this idea of a t-shaped employees and the idea was that, you know, all of your employees should share a broad range of General skills that allows them to navigate their work like to eat the top of the tea, but then you know, each of your employees individually should have one domain specific area of expertise and you know, if you put all your teeth together with Envy ideas that there's someone on your team who can cover that whole Spectrum shift into  Trying to become more of a pie-shaped person. So the idea is that you have you know, what you're requiring all these technical skills. All these statistics on computational and mathematical skills in the data science program war in the cognitive Science Program, whatever program your in but you should also have a domain specific knowledge that is different from the statistics in in Computing and data scientific skills that we mostly talked about in this class. And so on that note I would you know that there a couple ways to approach how you would like to know how you would like to have to build the other leg of your pie in or you're rebuilding vote stats Computing like here, you know, one option is to lean really heavily into your minor. So if you're majoring in data science, you know minor in something like  Cognitive science or some other kind of hard science like biology chemistry or physics. You can also, you know lean into a business minor but if you're having to go through flesh out and follow some passion and if that manifests itself, you know as taking a few more classes are electives in your mind or something like that then fantastic, but you know that will that will tell you hey, it's not just that I am a data generalist or Computing generalist, but I also know how to apply those skills to this specific domain and the idea is that employers are more willing to you know, hire someone who has that kind of domain expertise and also knows how to apply applications go to that domain versus just having someone who is a copy station on analytic.  So if you know it it's all so, you know, I bet there's a lot of like talk in college in my experience about following passions and that kind of thing but that isn't always so easy for everyone else more for there's always so easy for for for for everyone said to to think about it isn't following packing like that isn't necessarily good advice. So, you know, if you could also take it like a completely analytical approach to a what kind of domain expert you would like to be  So here's one and would approach that I was thinking about so I looked up what were the top paying jobs in America. And so these are them so pharmacist and Pharmacy manager. So a lot of like health and then also, you know a lot of text software engineer software development manager it manager.  And you could also break down these job is that about exactly half of them are really hard to know what it's really difficult to automate surgery to automate, you know, someone representing you legally in court or or especially anything related to help and then the other half of the folks are focused on automation, you know, they are there they're racing to to automate other job and to automate their own jobs, you know, you know what has you know what when I was an undergraduate if you wanted to set up a server or web application will put some data online. You needed to hire peta2, you know by equipment new to rent a space in your University or or in your workplace like without equipment. You would hire someone to  Aristide equipment and you know was that the job of that technical job which is involved in automation of actually, you know, taking care of shoes rooms of servers and everything else. It's so has has been automated. You know, now you go online to Microsoft Azure Amazon web services, you know, you asked for a server and you've got one but you got a computer server that you can use in like 30 seconds. So  I guess my point is is that if you know if your if you don't have any particular passion and you're thinking about your career think about this big economic shift automation that we're going through and maybe how you can see yourself in it.  Through this is a kind of a summary of what I have said if if there's Hilux fixing to take away. I think he's the most important. So first I have some technical advice devices in order to prepare for getting your first internship for Doctor job data science is learn one programming language extraordinary really? Well, you know, I would say like pick one and stick with it. I highly recommend python if you already have like experience with JavaScript in your instant website stuff in website that all Lake Charles Smith commit to and you can actually do a lot of data scientific work and JavaScript and that's getting better. Every year are is also a fantastic language. You know, I'm like a very heavy and committed our user  But you know python is is is like a great and generous language. I thankful will always be with us until you've already got some Python and experience in this class. So I would I would just dive into learning that is as as well as early as possible.  Sequel you should learn extraordinary. Well because SQL is the lingua Franca of the business world, you know SQL is it is is older than anyone in this room. It is deeply integrated into you know into almost every kind of business and into businesses that serve other businesses and so learning learning how to get on one hand. You know, what I'm telling you is, you know, you could you could go take the database, of course in computer science department. However, you know that course will teach you how to databases work and how to engineer databases and that isn't necessarily important for being able to efficiently structure SQL queries to know how to run them into know how to quickly retrieve data from SQL databases. So what I'm saying is to get to become facile as kind of an end-user  Expert where you can log into database query data efficiently.  And also a learn how to set up an interact with Cloud Computing Services Services. There's no more, you know, the the amount in undergraduate education up until this point most of the work that you do it on your own personal computer and you don't really need to think about other computers. You know, what you think about me no work that you're executing on a computer, you know in some Warehouse somewhere that you might take 24 hours to complete. You don't think about having multiple multiple computers contact each other in an automated fashion. I'm in order to work together on some complication or in order to have some conversation distributed across them. So definitely more and more business practices is going towards putting all the data, you know quote in the cloud between a wheelie in these in this In This Cloud Computing Services. And so you should definitely try to acquire those.  And then in terms of actually applying to jobs make sure that you know create a resume have people review it. You know, there's a lot of like simple resume mistakes that you know what you're showing at two or three other people can help you catch me if you can catch those and and you can find a resume so that it's relevant to potential employers establish. Some kind of professional web web web presence, you know at minimum have your profile updated on LinkedIn but also, you know, if you're working on a data science project and you can show that on the kids Hub account are personal website or on a Blog that's also fantastic and it'll be prepared to apply to many dozens of jobs. The rejection rate is extremely high. It's over 90% And it's not personal it doesn't have to do with your skills your your educational achievement. You know, what your background necessarily it's this is just the name.  Picture of a client of any system where folks have to agree to make a match so, you know be it'll be gritty and 1/2 a 1/2 in a reply to those jobs efficiently, but also learn how to how to take those projections.  I have to offer extremely special thanks to Emily Robinson Vicki boikess who both wrote to Fantastic blog posts in the last month which 100% forward my thinking and you know, lots of this material is just from those blog posts. They are both working data scientist and I highly recommend taking a look at their work looking at their personal websites in their web presence and honestly emulating a lot of a lot of stuff that they do we especially is a kind of just out of college and was very recently in the position that you're all in.  Of course, I have to slide in a totally Shameless pick, which is that a couple of online courses. I'm not really sure cellulose courses or sell you anything in particular. But if you're interested in becoming more facile with the command line, which is a skill that I highly recommend for anyone who training to be a technical General and if you want to learn about a how to set up some Cloud Computing Services, like I was talking about before and how to interact with those Cloud Computing Services teach you how to do this in my road called the Unix workbench. The book is free online at that website. You know, I'm a little surprised person will buy tickets. It's a great foundation for any kind of anyone starting technical career.  And that's all you can find all the links and everything else included in the slide talk including me slides at this URL and thank you all so much and you look at me. I'd be happy to have a discussion. How much time do I have?  So that's a great question. So the question was what cloud service do I use for my personal website? So there are two that I recommend the easiest one to setup is GitHub on GitHub provides personal websites for free and you can make them relatively complex the thing about getting out of this. You know, you have to know how to code a son, you know a little bit of HTML a little bit of JavaScript, but it's not that heavy handed.  I also highly recommend, you know, if you don't want to do any cleaning necessarily to set up a website and you just want to start writing online and sharing data scientific artifacts is medium.com Media Mister very like stylistic. We pleasing site for posting a kind of content and a lot of people have been successful sharing their materials there.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  short short  Oh wow.  I just I was just thinking like  it's okay.  Are you should all be feeling in the bubbles for your PID and information to the right of it? Just like we did for the last exam.  If you already answer the clicker question, don't worry about anything if you were here for Sean's house and didn't get to answer in the beginning cuz you came in late you can.  Answer the following question now.  I'd rather questions have you said anything to change the right way?  I'll call back in a few seconds. Keep your hands up if you don't have a Scantron yet and if your version 1.  Come to the side and at the end if you a virgin to come to this side down the side just to make it easier and faster as y'all get out of here ASAP.  80  I shall be telling that in.  And make sure he has it.  Dim sum in the middle here.  Giving someone here here to over here.  Is there an over here?  Where do I have to do still need a Scantron 9th and high?  Radiator you didn't fill in the bubbles for your PID.  I thought as last time but they really finishes up there feeling in their bubbles. Make sure you fill in a bubble for each question at the end double check that you've only filled out a through D. We had some people feel that he last time and it's not a response on yourself. Throw it all the bottles filled in and completely fill in one for each answer and at the end up with check the only put A B C or D for any of them. There are 30 questions. When we handed out the fire at first, please put it right on your Scantron. I will let you all know when to start down together. So take it when it comes to you put on your Scantron and we'll all Starve Together Every Day's the same amount of time any question.  Again virgin when it comes to this I'd version 2 comes to that side.  Are they going to have to beg for me?  Going past it back.  Take One path  I'm Hatchback for me.  Start packing a bag for me.  Take one pass it back.  Is it bad for me?  I was but reading across the back Sunday process.  Okay.  extra backyard  Y'all don't have it.  extratorrents  happy after exams to your right, please.  Angry Birds  do or do not know.  That's not fair.  You'll have to be will have.  7 if you're okay.  Is an extra.  extra exam  advance  Ridge Road, if you don't have an exam.  Everything gets better.  10 minutes left  How many morning?  China set  I finish up and bring it to the front. "
