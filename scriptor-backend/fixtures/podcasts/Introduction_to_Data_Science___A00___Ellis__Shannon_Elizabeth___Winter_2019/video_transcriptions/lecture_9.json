    "Full Transcript": "Harry will get started as people settle in horse reminders. You have your second assignment due this Friday and the fourth reading quiz is due next Friday. You can now see if your back and your marks for the third reading on TriNet and just a note it's not there yet, but there will be a mid-course survey for extra credit that I'll send that out and it has to be if you want their try to done also by Friday in the night. So that would come out. So today is a slightly more full than normal because of them at the end. We are going to talk about data visualization for this first part. I scheduled this topic for today because it does require you all to interact a little more with me. It's not sure I'm going to have you all looking at visualization after I present them and discussing. What's the visualization to trying to show and how it could be better? So today I want if I gave you all data, I want you to be able to tell me what type of visualization would be appropriate to take a look at what is in those data? I want you to be able to look at a graph or a table and interpret it effectively and also to be able to look at graph and determine issues that are make it problematic when you look in visualization.  I prayed up and I'll give you everything like 5 Seconds. We will have clicker questions today. So feel free to get those out now and I'll let people settle in.  So let's all quiet down. If you're filtering in late, please do so quietly their seats up here. There's these here it is if you were here.  Okay. So today I'm to be working through a few types of visualizations and they're going to use this data set to visualize the information stored here. So this is only subset of the data call the Davis stated that the information about 200 individual and these are individuals who are active in their daily life and they had their height and weight taken and then also there reported weight and height was stored in this information in the state of  Okay. So the first type of visualization I want to discuss are histograms histograms are helpful when you have a single variable that stores quantitative information.  So here we have information about the heights of individuals in the state of set and on the y-axis and a histogram. You have the number of people that fall into that been so histograms are dependent on the bin sizes. But here there been in 5:00. So here you can see that there are this many people between 145 and 50 a few more between 1:50 and 1:55. And when you take all of this information together, you get some idea of what typical values are in your data set.  So the first thing when you look at a histogram is you want to determine what the typical range of values is. So you look and see that most of the information is between 150 and 200.  You also know when to start looking at what's the tallest peaks of what are the most common values in the data set? So here the way you interpret? It is in this band between 165 and 170 cm are about 40 people little few more than forty people that fall into that been.  Did everything with these is there anything outside of the typical range and we can see it over here that this at x-axis fans further because there's a person over here.  Another way that you would visualize the stimulant the same type of information. So a single variable that is quantitative would be a density plot. So density plot is a smooth version of a histogram. So you see that you see the same shape, but it's just a smooth line.  And it gives you the distribution of the data when we refer to the distribution of the data were talking about the range and the shape so you can see that there's a lot more information over to the right, but there is some information over here to the left side of the scale.  Whatever you're looking at a visualization. You should first day. Like what's the overall pattern here? They're well pattern is that most information is between 150 and 200 and then your I should look is there anything weird the first general pattern second is anything weird when I mean weird it's what's going on with this person over here whose height was measured at 50. This would be a day to enter. This could be just a person that tends to be on the shorter side. And that's something that you would want to consider when you're looking at these data.  Okay, so far two versions there more seats appear for people in the back.  We talked about histograms and density plot. There's no way that you can simply visualize quantitative information about a single variable but often were interested in understanding the relationship between two quantitative variables. And that's where you would use a scatter plot. So here we have two quantitative variable weight and height and as I mentioned before you want a first look at the overall pattern the first day of Titanic by is what does each point represent and here is point is a different individual in your data set. So we have 200 points plotted and its overall trend shows that generally the more you weigh the taller you are and this is not surprising but this is how you interpret a scatter plot. And the next thing you want to do is look for things that are weird and over here. We have somebody who is always more but tends to be shorter that is likely their way in height, but it's something that's a little different than the general trend.  Okay, histograms and density plot for single quantitative variables Scatter Plots for two quantitative variables. And then we haven't talked at all yet about categorical variable. If you want to summarize the information stored in a categorical variable. The first thing that comes to mind should be a bar pot. We look at a bar. But here is your categorical variable. In this case. It's gender and then on the y-axis, you have the number of people in the data set that fall into each of those categories. So they went the first thing I want to do is take a look at the y axis and see what kind of numbers were dealing with were about a hundred for each of them. And then you want to look at the difference between the bars. So there more females in the state of that. Then there are male again overall pattern that there were females and males and then anything that's different between them. You would look at the difference in the size of the park.  Okay. So first question, there is an experiment those run and we're going to quickly in this class. I'm determine which segments here. So you see segments are label ABCD. Is this the third largest?  For those of the frequency code is 80. It's on the board.  What's the forecast for today?  All right. I'll give everybody a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so there's some disagreement with people having chose chosen all options, but there's some disagreement between a and c will come back to this.  Next question, which segment is the third largest here?  Kevin a few more seconds  3 2 1  All right, so overwhelmingly I'll let you be able to see the data.  Hair when we're just turning which one's the third largest in the parking lot. The vast majority of you said that a is the third largest Saudi then be than a to the same information was presented in both of these pots that has been done on previously. So a was the correct answer in both cases. So there's this experiment that was wrong and it was a little more complex than what we did hear. They took 10 sets of these plots and they showed people both the pie charts and the bar graph and then one of them to discern what the difference was in the size of a plot.  And what they saw and this is from the paper was a terror, which is generally a bad thing you want to reduce are so there was more error when we were looking at pie charts for the angle. Then there was it when you're looking at a bar chart where you were just starting between physician. So there's this pervasiveness a pie chart in our population. You probably have generated them, since you were in middle school or high school and data scientist largely hate pie chart and they will if you send them one asked you to give them a bar chart and the reason is because of this experiment we know that if we're looking at differences in sizes of a whole or better understanding between bars that we are looking at a pie chart. So you're reading for the next week. We'll take a amethyst discusses in a little more detail. But because of this experiment in the fact that most days I just hate pie charts on because of the error, we're not going to discuss pie chart. We're going to stick to bar charts when you're plotting the distribution of a categorical variable.  So a was right answer for both of us. Okay, recovered histograms and density plots for quantitative variables Scatter Plots for two quantitative variables, and we looked at barcharts for a single categorical variable. But if you want to summarize a quantitative and a categorical variable together, the most basic plot is a boxplot. There are other options that are even better than if this is the standard we're going to start with that what you see here is a categorical variable on the x-axis and a quantitative variable on the y-axis.  The middle line and we're going to find what median is next lecture is the most typical value in the data set. So you can see that the median for males is higher than that for females again in the states that this is what we would anticipate but when you don't know what to expect in the days that this is a really good idea of a really good way to get an idea of what information is encoded in your variable.  The lines outside of the box tell you the typical range and will Define that next lecture to of what values are most frequently found in each variable. So you can see that there is a spread amongst the garlic is a female they don't all live right at 168th and Ismail don't all live right around 185 and then any of the points that are individually plotted are individuals who are outliers or fall outside the typical range. I'm going to find the width mathematically next lecture.  The last thing I want to mention about the general types of grass is at tables are also helpful for visualizing data. So if you want to summarize how many people are in your data set or what typically is found amongst those categories a table can be really helpful, but there are rules for how to make it to summarize information while within a table and we'll talk about those today. Okay. So we're going to run through a few of these to summarize information. We just talked about. So in this one you have data about a child's height and their fathers height. What type of visualization would you go to First?  Feel free to talk to each other to liar.  Kevin a few more seconds  3 2 1  All right. We're kind of all over the place scatter plot was the most popular and bar plot.  What's the second most popular who wants to defend their position?  Every confidence in the one they chose.  Yes.  I just had a thought because the two numerical variables.  Okay, Barry Meijer's that they chose scatter plot. And because they're both numeric or their quantitative cuz they're both height one of the Thailand one of the father and that's correct. So scatter plot would be the most appropriate visualization in this case.  Okay, what do you want to visualize information about gender?  Give me a few more seconds.  3 2 1  okay. About half of y'all safe are flat, which is the best response here. So that is just recall us something that I said earlier. If you have a categorical variable, you would choose a flower pot in that case.  What if you want to see if there's a difference between the height of individuals who eat breakfast and those who do not?  few more seconds  3 2 1  okay, in this case you're looking at a categorical eat breakfast vs. Ana quantitative to a box plot would be the most appropriate Choice there.  All right. I'm going to skip the next one. So we covered the basics of data visualization the types of plot to make based on the type of variable. You have things get a lot more complex than that will cover that in a liter of visualization lecture given those visualization and general visualisations are a number of things. You should think about when you're creating them.  Super example, I'm always going to have the thing you shouldn't do on the left for these and the thing you should do on the right for this next set of lies about this one. Choose your right type of visualization. If you want people to discern the differences between the size of the pieces of the pie. You should choose a bar plot which allows us to more easily easily visualize them and that goes for all of you should consider what type of information you want to see and then use a chart that stuff appropriate for it.  Similarly, I'm you should be mindful when choosing colors a great deal of the population are color-blind. So I've label them for anybody in the room who is colorblind that this is red. And this is green and you should not use red and green in cases where you want people to be able to discern between the colors on a pots of it matters. Don't use red and green to differentiate there. Lots of other types of color blindness and there are a lot of research based on what colors are best to use the simplest to stay away from is using red and green to differentiate between groups.  Also label your axes. So this tells you just that this is bigger than this. You don't know what information is stored here. You don't know what these groups are. So in any visualization you make for this class and anything you make going forward ask these should be labeled or the ugliest the information should be clear as to what stored in the plot.  I'm always talking about exes. Make sure you text is big enough. So here I want everybody in the back of the room and the front of the room to know what's here, and I don't want anybody to have to squint remember that on a piece of paper. This font size. You need will likely be different than the font size. You would need to project information in a presentation. So always be considerate of who your audience is what medium you'll be using it to present information.  So this one says make sure your numbers add up. So 75 and 20 is 95 and this is a pie chart where it has to add to a hundred to make sure that this does not happen to you and that your numbers actually add to a hundred and reflect the information in the chart.  Similarly, make sure that the numbers reflect the what information you're showing. So in this case 55 is bigger than 45 despite. The fact that this piece is much bigger and the actual number should be 25 and 75. I know this probably seems obvious but this happens so much more than it should in the real world to compare sizes when things are close together. So all this extra white space between These Bars limits the readers interpret ability and when you're generating figures your goal should always be able to make it easier on your viewer to see your your point.  That's another big one.  Over here in the bad side the y-axis starts at two hundred and over here the in a good side the y-axis starts at zero when you are plotting information. It is almost always best to start your y-axis at 0-4 barcharts because this makes it look like the differences are a lot bigger than they actually are. So if you want to mislead your viewers, this is the way you should go and this happens all the time in the news and in visualization presented to make appointment look like something's worse than it is when we're out of the numbers aren't that different? So this is a general rule if your point is to receive readers. This is an easy way to do it. Okay.  Another general rule of good visualization is to make the figure as simple as possible.  Here if you look at this and when I look at this, I see India and I see more red over here and more green over here. And in the small Legend. Says that red is non-vegetarian and green is vegetarian. When I take all this in I get there are more people who have a vegetarian diet on the eastern half and more people are more people in half and more vegetarian on the western half that information. I discern from this spot when I look at it, but there's a lot more that they stuck on here that I can't really discern just from looking at it. So they should probably have simplified. This will talk about chloroplast in a liter lecture that likely would have been a better way to make their point. And if the point I'm taking isn't the one they wanted to make they should have thought about a different way to do it because this is just much too much going on with all the numbers the different size circles and things all over the second one. That was put out.  Obama administration to explain their Healthcare System  if the goal was to explain how complex it was going to be there complish that but if it was anything else they did it because it only inspires confusion. Like I can't start anything from this except for a lot of things go through the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Like that's the only other piece of information aside from the bewildering over way array of new government agencies regulations and mandates. So think about what you're trying to communicate look at what you create and if it doesn't communicate what you want it to redesign.  So those are a bunch of rules about the general charts that we talked about. Also. I said tables or visualisations. This is something we don't discuss a lot and then people complained that people don't do it. Well, so I want to make sure we talked about how to design a table. Well as our human brains do better at visualizing information from top to bottom and tables. So if you want people to be able to compare the information in the arrival delays in the table line them up from top to bottom rather than making the human I go left to right 4 numbers.  Similarly, I don't know that boxes. You should sort them in a way that communicates your point. So if you want people to take away the fact that Cleveland Hopkins International has the largest the way and Bellingham International has the shortest the life order the rose in a way that communicate that  Same thing goes for column in English reading countries. We read from left to right. So make sure your lining things up in the way. You would want people to interpret information. So if you want them to First understand the airport and then at the end get to the delay, you would order it in this way. We're over here you're seeing delay time before you know, what they are for name is this of course this rule of Left Right only works for languages. We read from left to right. It would be the opposite otherwise  Similar if you're trying to communicate information in a table, there's only so much that are human brains can discern from looking at a table. If you have this many rows, you should consider a visualization of some other sort I'm going to do that should be black. This is Cleveland. If you have it just a few rows of information that we can understand by the bataclan. That's a good time to use a table.  Wesley same thing we talked about with variables for specifics within a table. Make sure that your labels actually share information with your reader.  And make sure that you don't include all of the possible digits in any values you put in your table. This is not meaningful to humans when they first computer that usually two decimal places is like the max you want to include in a table when you're trying to convey a value.  Do things really quickly include a good caption tell readers what you want to get out of the table including Source if your data came from somewhere and make sure the table in general like general rule of all of these is make sure that is formatted. So to be quickly understood.  Cities next to you. I'm going to open at 72nd and I want you to look at the visualization try to interpret it and I'm going to talk about what interpret how you interpret what you got out of it and whether or not it's a good visualization. So there's only two options yes or no.  So is this is relation good?  Give her a chat with each other.  at 3  2 1  Alright, so we have some disagreement who would like to explain what they interpreted. What information did this. Tell them? What do you learn from looking at this graph?  Yes. Okay. So the first thing is that it looks like but you look at the graph that salt is more than sugar but it's not and why do you say it's not? Okay. So the number here is 55% even though it's less than 50% So we're going to say no on this visualization for those reason so we don't actually know what the truth is here. We don't know if they mislabeled or if they miss that your speech should be smaller. So we're not exactly sure what the answer would be here. So this is not a good visualization.  What about this will take a look at with each other. Is this one any good?  02 Civic for sale  a few seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so we still have some disagreement. We have the majority saying that this visualization is a good one. Okay. So tell me what you learned when you looked at this spot. What are we was being displayed here?  Nobody want anything from this spot.  most people eat you said medium well  Okay medium steaks about the biggest. Okay. So we're looking at the percentage of respondents who prefer steak in these different ways and the most common was medium.  Not just snow in Decatur at the top. You can't tell if it's a percentage or not. So they put percent here, but they don't put it there in your eye would be first drawn to hear so it might be helpful to have percent shown either throughout or be labeled on an axis. I think that is a criticism of this proper. I think generally this is a pretty good plot. I heard somebody over here say they like the colors and hear the colors aren't necessary to determine between them because you can see the bars but it is nice that they well done is darker than the light and Azar resemble the color of meat. So I think those are great colors for the spot to so generous to the pretty good visualization and I think the only thing is that something could be bigger and that percent could be made more.  Alright next one. What about this one?  Talking to her. What? What is it? Tell you what, do you learn? Do you like it or not?  Give me a few more seconds.  3 2 1  All right, in this case the majority said no who would like to defend their position?  Okay. So the point being made is that there are two different y axes and that this one was up to 5 trillion. And this is a hundred trillion. So these are completely different scale and why is that problematic?  Great, so you can't make an accurate comparison hear it suggests that these are comfortable when really they're all just like completely different scales and it's German line should be way down toward zero and this should be higher so generally dulac's where you have two different waxes or something to be avoided and there's a better way to plot the same information.  So this is not a great visualization.  All right opens up everything about this one.  Give me a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so we overall think that this is not a great visualization, but we have plenty of people say that they think it is. What's her say what's good about this plot?  What does a spot do well?  I will come back to that. What is this? What is it talking about?  Okay, so we're comparing things to each other so across categories and we're plotting some quantitative the use of our class. So they're comparing things we can see that over time changing something else that is as well as a visualization.  It's really clear on this message. And what do you take away at the message from it?  Is increase or decrease over time increasing over time, so we get an idea that they're showing something over time and it's going up anything else. We like about this visualization.  What day is everything? All the time is pretty clear. Things are large enough for you to interpret at a glance. Okay, what don't we like about this visualization?  Okay, so the y-axis even though I covered a little bit here doesn't start at 0. So it makes these differences despite the fact that they are increasing look much larger than they actually are. So that was all we talk about if you're trying to deceive don't start a zero, so I would say that's its biggest biggest flaw. I hear anybody else have a thought. Yeah.  Distract from the graph and I would argue that less will be more only put as much information up there as you want to get your message across so while it's good that they included the source. And again, this is from a TV screen. So all this information is added on and it's distracting from the message. So only include as much information as you need  Okay, last one just as much. There's a little more going on here.  every few more seconds  3 2 1  Okay, sweetheart, pretty even split a few more people saying that they don't like the visualization then they do let's first discuss what's being presented here. So what are actually is here?  And then what's being shown? What's the trend over it?  Your percentage. I hear you yell out here. It's a little light here and then we have some percentage and then what percentage is being shown on the y-axis what that's the percentage of  Okay, so the Raiders from 5200 and what's it representing like what's being plotted?  Median hourly earnings. Okay, and then we have a bunch of lines on it. So it's breaking down by the ethnicity of women. And then what do we have at the top? What's that line across the top?  There were no response team meeting hourly earnings as white men. So then what is this communicating?  Share of earnings of women have tremendous lower than 100% increase in overtime in the fairies by that women earn less than men good news is that it's generally increasing but it is not increasing at the same rate or at the same level across ethnic line already got that. Okay. So what if somebody was that they do like it? Why did you say that or for somebody who didn't like it? Why did you vote that way? Cuz I think both are valid.  Are people born with you? That's okay. Yeah.  Oh, sorry. I was going to just come back and I'll come to find ya.  I went out in the back yet. This is only right.  Okay. So the argument is that it's kinda hard to read things are light and small and that it doesn't start at zero. I'm going to push that a little on the dear. I think that's right here. It's  Because it's not a bar pot. It doesn't matter as much and we can talk about that. I'll make sure to make that even more clear the next time you talk about Tuesday to visualisation. But yeah, it's hard to see exactly what those numbers are or what they mean. I'll come up here now same thing. Okay. So let's hope we don't like people that they do like it.  arguments as to why yes  It just got the message that woman.  Cohesive for the fact that is presenting a lot of information it does that effectively right. So, you know your relative to men up here. It's clearly showing what the trend is for each of the four groups and there's a lot of information out of here. So I think this is a good way to prevent this also know that this was for reading on a screen not on projector to a class. So if we're they were protecting his who make everything Barger and that does detract I think overall given the complexity of the information presented. This is a pretty good day to visualization.  We're going to use those a different day. It was good discussion. So the next thing as y'all know will be exam. So the first thing to do is get everybody in a seat. So if you are not in a seat if you up here, there are few over here. So we'll need you to be in a seat.  Put everything away. Make sure your phone is off. Make sure you have a writing utensil.  A letter to get settled will start passing out the Scantron and then discuss it.  All right up here.  yeah, but sarcastic no doubt over here where they see here and there and they're  are tensions are being passed out will check in a bit to make sure everybody has one.  You can start filling out your information on your Scantron when you get it.  Okay, there are three pieces on a Scantron that matter. I don't really care if you feel any other stuff as I said, but you do need your student CID number. I'm going to repeat this if you time you need to enter that and you need to fill in the bubble. This is a great time to practice fill in the Bible's fully and completely you'll need to do that on your exam.  Write your name and then when you get your test, you will fill in which version it is.  weather  Okay, reminder fill out your student ID number fill out the bubbles put your name on it and when you get your exam or mind you for version?  there's something  how many of these should you make?  You can use a pen or a pencil.  overseas  Passover please  Do you have any music?  Oh, novinha, so get them up.  Okay, we're going to pick it up.  I'll start here. He'll come down past those over.  I slept enough of that row glacier to gets one.  I think  Happy Blessed, please.  Happy to the O I think Sean's coming up easier.  freezer app  Okay, your Scantron should have your student ID number. You need to fill out all the bubbles fill them out fully shot of Top 40 for Deshon.  We're trying to cheat on a Scantron.  If you don't have a Scantron sheet at this point, raise your hand really high, please.  Okay.  Right before I'm going to pass Fe exam. We're going to have you as a pet. I'll just put it under your Scantron don't start. We'll all starve the same time. You'll have plenty of time. You'll have till the end of it. To finish this bill in every bubble for every Riverside feeling a bubble for every question on the exam. Let me repeat myself cuz I was a terrible nip slip for each question. Make sure you fill in a bubble fill that bubble and completely and make it clear what your choice is. So answer every question and fill-in-the-bubble fully make sure you have these three pieces of information diversion number will be at the top of your exam for get started any questions.  Having somebody up here.  So just answer had all your information filled and bring it back up the exam when you get the exam place it under your Scantron, please then we'll all start together once everybody has the exam.  We're going to pass up the roof of the columns are called.  Is there an goes under your Scantron, please?  Take one pass it.  Take one pass it.  surprise  assassinated  please  Take one pass it across please.  I need a few more.  Y'all don't have any air in this room to run across.  extra  Happy actors that way in the middle site.  Play treat them under your Scantron, please.  drip down here  right  Two more here. Thank you.  I'll have it every good.  No problem.  Raise your hand if you don't have an exam at this point.  If you didn't fill out the bubbles on your Scantron for your PID raise your hand.  NFL how completely in the circles raise your hand?  Anybody still need an exam?  Rich I'm really high if you want exam.  Okay, y'all can get started.  There's 5 minutes left.  R e x i feel need to bring everything up to the front. "
