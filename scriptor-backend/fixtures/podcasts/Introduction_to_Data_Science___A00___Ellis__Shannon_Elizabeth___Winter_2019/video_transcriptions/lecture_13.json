    "Full Transcript": "I will get started and ready at the end as people decide if they want to stay here for the finishing of data of his and doing a little bit of exploratory data analysis. Say your welcome will do some practice in lecture. If not, make sure you leave quickly and quietly so that we can make that transition as quick as possible General reminders do this Friday. I'm sorry. We don't have your marks back yet for the second assignment. They should be out by the end of today. I'm your final reading is due next Friday a reminder that we settled that Thursday. We will have a guest lecture will use iclickers for taking attendance at day and we have a data scientist from classy, which is a company here in San Diego. So think about what questions you want to ask or want two things you want to know about from a data scientist. She'll give you a little presentation about her story how she got into data scientist what she does with her company does Financial open it up to questions from you. Also bring your questions to class on Thursday.  I left an announcement is that my office hours this week or slightly change? This is because of the guest lecture on Thursday and so today from 3:30 to 5, and then Wednesday 10 to 11, and if you can't meet at those times and wanted to meet on Thursday, please email me.  Okay, whatever you set up player iclicker. This is similar to the question that I asked before except. The topics are different. This is just for my knowledge to CLD lectures in the middle of the Corso from getting paid through the descriptive exploratory analysis. We did and are both of the data visualization lectures. What percentage of the information has been new to you.  how to give everybody a few more seconds to click in  a321  All right.  So today's topic is inferential analysis. We talked about descriptive an exploratory analysis so far and tell her to start talking about the types of questions. You can answer using inference and what inference is the legal is that if I presented data presented question that you would determine whether or not inference is a proton appropriate approach. You would determine the variables necessary for modeling. We'll talk about what I mean. They are, but what do you need to look at in your day decide to answer the questions and you'll need to know what issues could lead to incorrect in France with things you need to look out for when you're doing in French analysis.  I've been showing this at the beginning of all the analysis lectures. We started it up here and said if you summarize the data as you should often in a table showing what variables you have what the common values are generating is descriptive statistics, like mean and median standard deviation variance looking at the distributions of your values descriptive analysis As you move to look at the relationship between variables and really understanding the entire day to that. That is an exploratory data sets notice. You have to go through these first two steps before you go to answer this question up here. If you are trying to figure out how changing the average of 1 measurement affect another you go down this side and these are called my friends are mechanistic experiments that we're not going to talk about detail in this class. If you are not the next question I have is whether or not you're trying to predict measurements for individuals. If you're trying to predict measurement for individuals in the future that is predictive analysis. We'll talk about that next Tuesday. If you're not trying to predict something for individuals in the future you're doing Improv.  Think about what you're doing what type of question you're answering and if you are not doing prediction and you're not trying to figure out how changing the average of one changes another then you're down here in the entrance category.  So what we're doing in French on now it says this is a statistical analysis to answer. The question is their relationship if there is a relationship you want to know how strong that relationship is what direction it goes in and there's a types of things. We're going to talk about today.  What are the inference we need to refresh our minds about sampling? So this is something I touched on briefly in the descriptive analysis, but we're going to talk about it in a little more detail here.  So Supreme, this will use an example of a type of inferential question. If you want to know whether or not Sesame Street effects kids brain development street is a children TV show that has been sold as something that will help children. Learn more. It supposed to be educational. It's not just for entertainment for the only way we know whether or not it is actually a educational is whether or not it affects kids brains development and those who watch Sesame Street actually improve on measures of development. So this is a little too broad if you wanted to get to the data science question, you would ask. Is there a relationship between watching Stephanie Street and test scores among children because we're looking to determine whether or not there's a relationship between two variables and understanding how strong that relationship is how much that's my street does one have to watch in order to see a change and test scores if one increases of the other increase or is a relationship different than that. So this is what we're talking about when we're talking about in French analysis.  the relationship between variables  Open an LG sister at the lecture we would have the different variables were interested in understand the relationship in a diagram like this. So we're trying to establish whether or not there is a relationship between Sesame Street viewership and test scores in children.  I mentioned that serious we would need to use sampling and I wanted to refresh our memories on what that is.  Often we want to answer questions about an entire population is the state of the population as including all of these different polygons or some of them are pink and some of them are gray.  Are Sesame Street example the population would be all children understand it all children. Do those who watch Sesame Street have different test scores than those who do not.  Do you have to take a sample because you can't measure those two things and the same metrics and all of the children in the Sesame Street example to take some subset of the population and that would be your sample.  So in artificial example, it would be all the children included in the study.  No, I want no matter what if we don't actually know how many pink or how many gray polygons are are in our population. We don't actually know the measurements for all of the children and the Sesame Street study. We only know those values in a sample.  The process of calculating an answer a questionnaire sample and then going back to determine what were the likely answer is in the population. That's what inference Is So based on the relationship. We see in our sample the fact that there are more pink pions and there are gray we can infer the answer to a question in our population.  Stamping process work in Sesame Street by viewing and assessment reviewing and test scores in a sample of kids we can then infer what that looks like in the population of all children.  So we're talking about inference. We're determining what our best guess is about the population at Large.  Based on the fact that we see more pink than more than gray in our sample. You would infer that you have more pink than gray in your population. So it could be there swear. These four are gray.  Truth could also be that there are 5 great right there still more pink than gray here or alternatively there could be only three. So we're saying it somewhere between 3 and 5. There's an idea based on what we see in our sample that there's going to be more pink than gray, but we don't know exactly what that measurement would be. There's going to be some uncertainties because we weren't able to measure exactly everybody's value in the population. We look at a sample we figured out what is going on there. And then infer what the likelihood is in the population.  Okay, that's a reminder last time we talked about populations and sampling we talked about the fact that your sample has to be representative. That's what we're looking at here. If your sample only has pink and gray polygons, but your population has pink grey and bluish purple. You cannot infer from this sample. You cannot calculate anything about the population if your sample is not representative of your entire population.  Sol review we talked about the fact that when you were doing in France you are drawing a representative sample from the population to answer a question you're answering the question in that sample and then you're inferring back what you think the truth is in the population and a Sesame Street example, we would look at values of test scores and Sesame Street dealership in a subset of children and infer what that looks like for all children in the population.  Another example of this is a paper that is titled the effect of air pollution control on life expectancy in the United States and Analysis of 545 you accounted for the. Of 2000 to 2007.  So what this paper look to do is determine whether or not there is a relationship between air pollution control and lifespan.  And I tried all we know that they didn't look at the entire United States, but that is a population to answer the question about they don't just care about a few counties. They want to know is there a relationship between air pollution control and lifespan throughout the United States? So to answer that They carried out their the collected data and 545 us counties and they made sure that these were spread out throughout the United States so that they weren't all from these hoes are all from the west or from the south and that these counties represented the whole of United States. They weren't us from rural or urban areas and that they were both suburban and Democratic area so that this was truly representative of the US and then they were able to establish the relationship between controlling pollution and increase in life expectancy.  So we've done this before but I just want to make sure we're also on the same page if Girl Scouts were randomly sampled from across the United States. What would be the likely population given this sample?  I get every few more seconds.  3 2 1  I to buy a March everybody got the right answer if we are only sampling Girl Scouts in the United States. It cannot be all UFC. No children cuz we're biased to only looking at Girl Scout camp be all u.s. Children cuz we're only looking at Girl Scouts children worldwide for the same reason and it can't be Girl Scouts worldwide cuz we can't assume that girl scouts within the United States a representative of Girl Scouts worldwide. We're really only able to generalize back to us Girl Scouts in the United States.  Are there any questions so far about sampling what an inferential question would be?  What would be to a biased analysis?  Okay, so therefore General approaches to inference we're going to talk about the first 3 today to talk about correlation comparison of means and regression. We're going to talk about an example of each. So we'll talk about Pearson correlation T Test and simple regression assumptions that have to hold in order to be able to do any of these three types of analyses, but I want you to know that when these assumptions camping mat, there are other statistical approaches to answer question. So we say they have to have a normally distributed variable to carry out one of these tests. If you don't have that, you know, you can't do one of these three, but there are other tests to do we're just not going to cover them in class today.  So the person we're going to talk about is correlation and correlation is what we can use to measure the association between variables to determine what the relationship is between two variables.  I'm looking here. I'm going to be using a spot a fair amount. So we're looking here. We haven't really character at the fact that the x-axis is often known as the independent variable and the y-axis is also known as the dependent variable here. So some data plotted where we're looking at the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable correlation is what we can use to describe this relationship.  I just very generally when you have a weaker correlation, the points are going to fall further from one another and when you have a stronger correlation or higher correlation, you have a strong relationship where there's a closer relationship between the points relating the Independent to the dependent variable.  Jupiter describe correlation when you have an increase in the independent variable and an increase in the defendant and a lower value in an independent and a lower value in the deep end value. This is a positive correlation.  An example of this could be Father's height and Sons height because of genetics the taller a father is the taller his son is likely to be for we know that the father's height and the sun's heat are not exactly the same so we don't see a line that is straight there some variability among the heights. So this is an example of a positive correlation.  The opposite of this is a negative correlation wear with a lower your independent variable has the higher your dependent variable and higher your independent variable the lower the value is for your dependent variable.  Example of its in high school absences is the number of absences tend to have a negative correlation with students grades. So the fewer time they're absent the more the higher their grades 10 today.  Okay, so that was General alive. You've probably heard of correlation before but to make sure they were on the same page with positive correlation negative correlation. And we also want to know about the strength of the relationship between the two variables a way to calculate this is using linear correlation is to measure the linear correlation between two variables. And you do this measuring on Pearson's correlation. It's denoted by little r and this value can be somewhere between -1 and 1.  We're talking about a correlation value of -1 the negative two notes that it has a negative relationship and the one in indicates. That is a very strong relationship that all fall in a tight line on the relationship between X and Y.  The opposite to that is a positive one where you have the same relationship except it is a positive correlation zero is reserved for when there is no linear relationship between X and Y things to hear these are pretty randomly. You can't say that one one is higher. The other is lower. We don't have any type of linear correlation in those data.  They don't have to just be zero or one or negative one. There are values in between and you can see here 4.7 which is closer to 1B values or tighter along the line. Same thing for the negative relationship is .3 which is closer to zero has a wider relationship around this life. So this is a weaker correlation then point seven.  A word of caution so so far. I've been showing you a lot of pots where the scatter plot is linear where you have increase in Blood and secrecy and another this is the only one and a sconce worked at which I showed you in a previous life where we have a truly linear relationship despite the fact that these all have the same variability and mean in X & Y the bacteria is this is not a linear relationship. Outliers drawing determine the correlation. Here's to the only place for correlation should be measured using Pearson's correlation is here where we truly have a linear relationship between the variables.  This again white before going to look at the data people often calculate correlations on data where a measuring Pearson correlation is not appropriate. So you only use Pearson correlation when you have a linear relationship between variables.  I told what we looked at before here, we have two variables doesn't exactly matter what they are and I wanted to see what you all thought the correlation was for this relationship.  Feel free to chat with each other convince each other.  every few more seconds  3 2 1  okay, so by and large most people said that the relationship here is positive because it moves up into the right as we seen so we already know that it has to be one of these three values because this these are two negative values be pretty close falling to the line. So would not be in value very close to zero cuz there is some relationship between them. So now we're just between d and e and the correct answer here is D. I wouldn't give you a question disambiguous on an exam cuz you don't you have to calculate the values to know really which one it is that this is a graph where the Pearson correlation is .64.  What about this one?  You're already a few more seconds.  3 2 1  So this one again has to be positive because a relationship shows up when one increases so does the other and if there is some relationship between them so we can again be close to zero hear. This one is a tight tighter around the line on the last one which might be harder to see because I don't have an extra Heather. But this one the r is .92  That's one. What is the Pearson correlation coefficient for this relationship?  every few more seconds  3 2 1  So you're going to have it here. We see a negative relationship so we know that we're down here and there is some linear relationship here. So it's not close to zero. I'm not really tight around the lines of the correct answer here is .68 have to be closer to the line in order for it to be a correlation of point nine on Pearson's correlation here. And then we talked about correlation, of course have to remind everybody that correlation does not equal causation things big can be correlated without one causing the other the correlation just established that there is a relationship between the values that we're looking at. It does not establish causation. So few examples of that there's this website called spurious correlations where they have lots of things that happened to be correlated overtime decided if they don't they do not cause one another so we can see that overtime the trend of in a red line number people who drown by falling into a pool correlates very closely with the number of films Nicolas Cage of here then so we see it.  Daddy's little helper here increases drop down and it comes back up. So there's no reason to think that the number of people who drown falling into a pool causes Nicolas Cage movies or the reverse, so things can be correlated without them having any causal relationship.  the same thing for the divorce rate in Maine which has been dropping as has the per capita consumption of margarine and there's no reason again to think that one of these causes the other  Last one. This was a b c and what it looks at at is the interest rate over time. We have time on the x-axis and we have the interest rate and on over. We're looking at the height of the Fed chair and we seen that the height has decreased in the Fed chair over time as has the interest rate. And this is just an example that these two have nothing to do with each other that's interest rate changes for lots of reasons. None of which is the height of the Fed chair and they do not down here. We don't actually believe that the interest rates are determined by the height of the Fed chair, but it has an interesting coincidence. So there's lots of examples in the world where correlation exists, but they have nothing to do with causing one another so it's important to keep that in mind whenever you're looking at a correlation. Is that which is a relationship but doesn't mean that one causes the other  Okay, any questions about population sampling inferential questions or correlation up to this point any Pearson between -1 and 1 where is a strong relationship positive one is a strong positive relationship zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two.  So that shows the relationship between two variables to what did you want to know whether or not between groups in a variable that there's a difference in the means of those values do that. You would use a T Test.  And I'm going to look graphically or what this means and talk about how you would interpret the results from a t test but we won't talk about the math to do it.  As I mentioned test for difference in means between groups. So that means is if you have Heights, so we talked about this before we have Heights along the x-axis and we're looking at it the density plot. I'm here because I didn't make the spot females are the blue line and males are the black line and these are the heights for some 10,000 individuals.  The question is whether or not mean in email differs from the mean in a female can look at the Academy and somewhere around here in the middle for females and some around here for the mail. And it looks like there's some difference but is it statistically different from one another to answer a question? You would use a t test before you can do a t test their number of things you have to check to make sure something's are mad at each of these in detail the next fight at the date or continuous. The second is that they are normally distributed the third is that the sample size is large enough and 1/4 is that the there's equal variance between groups? Okay. So let's look at that in the context of the questions we're asking  Super appetizing large up here. We have 10000 values that are included in our sample because it isn't it sad class. I'm not going to talk about how we decide what they're going to say is the largest protest we want there to be more than 20 observations ish. So 10,000 lot more than 20. So we're good there. We said that they'd have to be continuous. We're looking at Heights which are continuous variable. So we're good there we needed the day to be normally distributed with cheer. We see that they largely are normally distributed and we want to do that. The variance is equal between groups. So if you remember from the descriptive statistics descriptive analysis lecture Darien's has to do with how far we from the menu our house right out the valleys are from the mean. So I've drawn that in here with these little bars and these are the same bars between them so we can see the variance is pretty similar between the groups.  Which means we can dance a is the mean for this distribution different than the mean here. So it's 69th. Sicily difference in 64 is based on the data.  Trailer with calculate something out of the T statistic. I'm not going to talk in detail what that is and we calculate a P value or talk about that in a second to talk about what we mean by a 95% confidence interval say something here is that if there was no difference in means if you took a mean of a male male height and I mean female height and subtracted those and they were the same that Daddy would be zero for pretty confident based on the data that we looked at that the true difference in means is somewhere between 5.21 and 5.43 in which we see reflected in the grass. So this is the valley where we expect the true difference in means Heights to be 95% confidence intervals. I haven't shown any teeth yet in this class. We probably heard it may be that there is controversy around people using what we should use. So I wanted you to find P value and then spend some time talking about what it means so that when you will see this in other courses or other work other contacts you had a good under  Okay, so we often at that decisions tend to use bad.  Examples and bad wording for think so I'm going to make sure that we all see graphically what this means more time. The p-value being the probability of getting the Observer results or result smartstream by chance alone. All right definition. We'll come back to that in a second. If you saw any do that a million times the daily look something like this and we can save this is what happens by chance alone. So it's just a random chance you would see most of the time you see half heads half Tell City here in this this distribution. We have the count here and most of the time you see eight head and a tail Sometimes you seem more heads than that. Sometimes you see fewer  Hey, baby, they're rather looking at counts of a million if we look at proportion here. So we're looking at here is the proportion of those Millions life where you see eight heads. So the time they serve on a chance alone. You will T8 heads and detail show me clear. This is what you see by random chance. You're not always going to get a exactly but most of the time you will in your million trials.  Okay. So the P value is the probability of getting me observe results for results more strength by chance alone. So, you know, this is what happens randomly. What if I then give you a coin and you flip it 16 times and 10 time you see heads your question is whether or not is the probability of seeing what you saw relative to what happens there been a chance.  Okay. So what you saw was 10, but 11 12 13 14 15 16. Those are all be what occurrence. Is that were more extreme?  Alternatively 6 is equally as unlikely as what you saw and so are as everything off to decide the results you saw which was 10 heads right here and all the results more extreme than what you saw are highlighted in pink boxes.  In order to calculate the p-value the probability of seeing what you saw relative to read a chance you then have to figure out how many occurred at each of these places in within the pink box you add those up and then divide them by all the possible trials. So you drive it by a million.  3 take the number of 10 or more shrimp lips all those in the pink boxes and we divide those by the 1 million trials that we did.  When you do that take all those to buy them by the number of Trials we have here is 1332 the p-value hear of your experiment relative to rent a chance with waste 133 3% of the time you would expect what you saw or something more extreme to occur.  Throw up in here if he dies of .05 is what we want to use to determine whether or not something is statistically significant what that says is that all of those in the random chance 5% of the time what you saw would have happened in all those random chances.  Okay, so we talked about what you saw they ran a chance seeing something in your experiment and comparing that back to what happens randomly. What if you observed 16 heads?  What would be the key value of that knowing that 410 it was Point 1-3.  gravity few more seconds  3 2 1  Okay, so largely people said that seeing 16 heads would lead to a t value that was smaller than what we saw and that's correct. So the reason here is that seeing what you saw or something more extreme what happened even less likely at 16. I'm so the numerator in that equation show before would be much smaller leading to a smaller P value. So the smaller your P value is the less likely your result is to happen to occur by random chance.  So if you return back to that question you asked before with the T Test and we asked see here that the P value is much less than .0001 what this means is that the probability of seeing this difference to seeing this difference in this space on the distributions on 3rd. And France is much by Ranch at the loan is much less than 1 in 1,000. So pretty confident that the height differ between males and females  All right. So the first question is why would a T Test not be appropriate for these data?  Very few more seconds.  3 2 1  so here are the results.  Twins explain to me what their thought process was for determining why t-test would not be appropriate for these data.  Okay. So do you ever hears you chose unequal variances? Because last time when I drew those lines the difference away from the mean with similar between the two distributions and here we don't have that so I completely agree that unequal variances was answer. That's most obvious here. I didn't tell you how many how many sides is and if memory strength is continuous you can probably assume that have continuous distributions. You need to know that these are pretty normally distributed based on looking at them. So unequal variances is the most obvious here as to why a t test would not be appropriate to remember their assumptions that you make to do a t test and if those are not met you cannot do a T Test  Okay, anime next one hour talk about that is would a T Test find a significant difference in means here. So you're looking at our per capita income between the Congo and Denmark and we're looking at density plot fear.  Feel free to chat with each other if you're confused.  Give everybody a few more seconds.  3 2 1  I'd say we have 76 people saying a and 61 people saying be I'm going to let you all talk with each other determine whether or not either a or b or right or should we change the Sandy and if any of your right which one is more appropriate and why and then we'll chat about it. So I opened it up again and try and convince each other and then I want to hear from you what you're thinking.  What is 87 lakh?  I'll give you a maybe 30 more seconds to convince each other to chat about it.  I buy more seconds.  3 2 1  Okay, so we had a lot of people say a but really that's only a few more total number than last times. We allowed people not respond, which means that maybe people runs are uncertain. Okay. So who wants to tell me why they chose what they did and what they're thinking was what they take away from this graph. What is y'all just chat about  In chat about T Test and have fun these distributions are way too great. Okay to let the take away from the spot. What do you learn from this spot?  What's the interpretation?  anyone  Okay, thank you. Are you arguing 80s is not appropriate because the variance between the two distributions is not the same. Okay, I'll go with that. So we're going to stay at cheetahs wouldn't fight a significant difference in means but we look at this. I think what's interesting is the fact that almost every individual measured in Congo has a lower income than everybody in Denmark. So the difference is there is a difference in the mean you just wouldn't use a T Test to measure it due to the fact that you're really not have overlapping distributions and the variances are not the same between the two distributions. So you want to hear the t-test but there is a difference in the per capita income in in Congo and Denmark any questions on that.  All right, we talked about correlation how when you want to measure the linear relationship between two variables you would use Pearson's correlation when you want to determine whether or not there's a mean a difference in the means between two groups and a continuous variable. You would use a t test and talk about is regression and is determined does changing one variable need to change mean there's a change in another way to talk about simple regression in this class. But in statistics course, you would talk about multiple regression, which is super helpful in data analysis.  So will return back here where we have two variables and independent variable on the act and a dependent variable in the Y and we're looking to better understand and describe the relationship between these two variables so we can use when you really ever gotten to describe this relationship linear regression. We talked about and drawing the line that best describes the data to determine which line is really want to say if we drew a line between the point and this line  For every single point on this graph, we would want the line that makes the some of those the smallest if you drew a line from here to the line from the point to the line and did that if I call them and send them up this line is the one that makes the sum of all those values the smallest.  And this is not a betting line because you're way more points above the line below the line see what you would be able to determine visually whether or not aligned is the best fitting line on basement fact that these distances would be really big and those on the other side are much smaller. So those would be balanced when you're generating the best fitting line.  We've talked about the word model. We having a surly Define what we mean here when we're drawing a line in linear regression. This is a model of the data. So model their mathematical equations generated to represent the real life situation so we can describe the characteristics of this line based on a mathematical equation algebra. It would be y equals MX plus C in statistics. It takes a different form, but all of them describe the characteristics of this line.  So without the data the way you use a model as you would say, okay, if we went along here, we found this variable and the independent variable. What would we expect the value to be for the dependent variable that it doesn't mean that the actual data were at that point but this is our best guess some models are are not fully accurate, but they're the best way we have to describe the underlying data.  So this is coming Fraser all models are wrong. And the reason we use models is because it describes lots and lots of data and it's our best guess but it's never perfect. It doesn't connect every single point in reality because we haven't measured everybody in reality. So use linear regression to explain the relationship between the variables, but it doesn't explain everything.  I was glad you talked about before correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables linear regression is what we can use to determine whether or not a change in the variable is related to change in another and by how much and in what direction.  We determine the magnitude of the relationship how big a change in one leads to a change in the other by the slope of a line and statistics is also referred to the as the effect size. So the effect size is bigger when the relationship is stronger and smaller when the relationship is weaker.  exercise me characterized by Beta And there'd be some value to describe it if there is no linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable beta is 0  When will Santa be a positive beta has the more the dependent variable increases as the independent variable increases the larger than value for beta will be and be less dependent variable changes based on a change in the independent variable the smaller the beta and the same works in the negative Direction where this all just have a larger negative number to describe a larger beta in a negative Direction.  Tulsa real ninja turtle by how how big the slope of the line we also have to take into account how close the points in the underlying data to the model falls toward that line to the pool today are the smaller the standard error is the farther away from the line the larger the standard error is and this means we're less confident in the relationship if we came up to the table and came up here and said that's my best guess would less confident in our guest in this case with these points are further from the line and we are over here with a standard error smaller. So whenever is Marge we're less confident in the model then when error is small.  Or talk about the P value for linear regression if the probability of getting of their results are results more stream by chance alone. So in the case of linear regression that takes into account, how about the slope of the line is your beta and how close the point spell to the line?  Sobe water to the effect size and the smaller the standard error the smaller your P value of 8.  As with correlational required a linear relationship with t-tops where we had the assumptions. There are number of assumptions for linear regression there requires that there is a linear relationship requires that all the variables are multivariate normal. You should be used in a slide in the second requires that you're independent variables Have Nots are not multiple linear which want to fly here cuz we're just talking about simple linear regression. I'll go back to bed and their value camping autocorrelated and you must be homoscedastic.  So we talked about in a relationship and we talked about this with an X worked at this is not a linear relationship because you don't have a linear increase or decrease over time. You can't use linear regression in this case.  We're talking about a multivariate normal. It's that the linear combination of the variables must be normal. So this is described here where you take the distribution of the Y variable and the X and you look at the of those values together where you have a scatter plot here where you would see identity in the middle and nothing falling off to either side.  Multicollinearity I said that doesn't matter here cuz we're only looking at one independent variable and one dependent variable multicollinearity occurs when you have multiple independent variables, and those can't be too highly correlated with one another.  Autocorrelation occurs when the observation that you see so the values in your data set are not independent of one another and example of this Era stock prices the price from one day affects the price for the next day. So this is a case where the values are all auto correlated with one another. So the value on this day is dependent on what it was the day before so you couldn't use linear regression in this case.  The last one I had to do with homoscedasticity and that means that the variance along the line has to be constant across the length of the variable. So here where the points are close to the line for lower values from much further from the line over here demonstrates that these data are not homoscedastic and this is why you wouldn't use linear regression.  Those are the five basic assumptions will go through them again and example here and the question is does poverty percentage affect teen birth rate. So we're looking to determine. Is there a relationship between these two variables? So I want to know what you all think is it what is the relationship between poverty percentage and teen birth rate?  Can I bring a few more seconds?  3 2 1  I didn't sweet 3/4 of the class saying positive relationship and then we have 1/4 distributed between no relationship and negative relationship. Then when they want to tell me they're thinking as to why they came up with a hypothesis.  Yeah.  So you think there was sorry I missed the first part so they had to the sex education of teen pregnancies.  Okay don't places where there is more poverty. There might be less resources for sex education and therefore would maybe have a higher birth rate. So then you would argue so that poverty percentage were higher the birth rate would be higher. So you're arguing for a positive relationship. Okay.  Actor Ruby hypothesis will look at the data.  The day that we're going to use our measurements at the state level. So there are 50 states plus the District of Columbia in this area. Look at the poverty percentage and the birth rate in individuals ages 15 to 17 in these states.  We are going to have to look at the assumptions. So these might not be the most perfectly normal distributions that are statistical test. You can determine to see if they are close enough to normal for the purposes of this example babies are close to normal decided that they have some variation on the right hand side of the distribution distributions for the two variables were looking at poverty percentage and birth rate.  I got a heck of a linear relationship so we can see that as one increases. So does the other so we know at this point that if it has a relationship between the two it's positive percentage of property increases. So does the birth rate by and large?  We have only relationships multicollinearity doesn't matter because we are.  It's only got two variables shouldn't assume that's early that one States poverty percentage affects the other that you could argue maybe that they do rapidly being near one another that they might have more similar, right? So that's something that might be a limitation to this analysis we're talking about how much could a society we don't see the value is falling super far away for anyone part of the distribution. Tell when your Russian is a reasonable thing to do here.  So we can throw line so we can draw a linear regression line for this is our best fit line through them. And this is the model of the data. This is a line that best describes the linear relationship between these two variables.  I'm so this is a model if we remove the underlying data and it's described that there is a positive relationship between the two variables.  And as we talked about before we want to know the effect size here, so the effect size is measured by Beta and it's been magnitude of this relationship and what I'm telling you here is that if you calculate beta hear the effect size would be 1.37. But what is that exactly mean? So if you want to interpret a what's a beta means for a linear regression, it means that for every increase along the x axis so far everyone percentage increase in poverty, you would expect to see the birth rate increased by 1.37 means is that for every one unit increase in the x-axis you would see a increase or decrease relative to the beta on the Y.  I told you before that the effect size isn't the only thing that matters. We don't just care about the slope of the line. We need to start running know how confident we are in the estimate so that we look at our standard error and I've drawn the standard error in here with this light gray line, but I'll make darker next time and the standard error is .18, so we would expect that for every increase. We were in poverty percentage. We will see 1.37 plus or minus increase in the birthrate.  Okay, so what if we wanted to do a similar analysis determining the effect of advertising on our sales?  Play looking at here is the relationship for these data for a European company and reported them here. So you have the advertising relationship with sales and I'm telling you the beta is 23 million dollars. So I want to see what y'all interpret the effect size to be here based on the options there. So feel free to chat with each other read them determine which one it is.  Give her a few more seconds.  3 2 1  Text to 81% of you said a and you're arguing that a beta of 23 million says that for every one Euro the $1 one gyro increase in advertising. We would be 23 more million dollars in sales. So that is the interpretation for this fade effect. Are you up for this analysis that you need to take into more things into consideration like the year and time. So if you were to do this correctly wouldn't just look at advertising over the history of your company and sales, but the interpretation here stands for everyone gyro spent on Advertising the company sees 23 million more in sales.  We talked about correlation. We've talked about linear regression and we talked about T Test to look at differences in means for continuous variables. We talked about the fact that correlation does not equal causation. We just got spayed effects and standard errors and P value and I wanted to talk about one last topic which is confounding and I was excited to talk about this topic cuz I could show you this example of this picture with my super cute nephews. So these are twins Colton Teigen example to show you that hear my shoes are much larger than theirs and I happen to be literate and they are have small shoes and they're not yet bitter but they're getting there and they pretend to be able to read. Okay. So the question is what the relationship between shoe size and literacy based on what the data we collected there. We would say that the largest shoe size the more literate you are.  Which season last we know that that's not true. That's not the case. There's a confounding variable hear the fact that I am much older than they are cuz they are children and I am an adult and what we're told we were talking about confounding variables were talking about variables that affect both sides of the equation for the two variables. We were looking at your shoe size and literacy. I'm looking at the relationship between them but age affects shoe size and age affects literacy variable that affects both sides of the equation. It is a confounding variable.  I worked so I'm going to suggest that there is an increase in popsicle sales when there is increase in crime rate, and I want to know what the confounder would be that relationship.  Can I read a few more seconds?  3 2 1  so a lot of people said temperature and that is in fact the correct answer so new gun laws or new law enforcement officers might affect the crime rate. So we would assume they would affect popsicle sale Hospital preference and changes in popsicle prices might affect popsicle fails, but they wouldn't affect crime rate temperatures. The only one that has an effect on popsicles with an increase in sales when it's hotter and crime rate with an increase in crime when it's not freezing cold out. So that's the reason that this is the only confounder out of the options here.  American Founders will lead you to draw incorrect conclusions from your analyses. So I wanted to talk about a real life example and the fact that if you plan ahead and account for possible confounding you can include them in your mouth and you can count for them. But if you don't you will come up with inconclusive false conclusions that what this is is data from a study of 400 patient and all the patients had one initial vertebral fracture and then either treated with conservative hair or vertebroplasty the 210 Scott conservative care to under them. A treatment and they determine the percentage of people with any group that had subsequent fractures 30 had fractures after their initial fracture over here only had fractures after their initial fracture. So they determine the relative risk, it looked that like people who had underwent vertebroplasty. We're at twice the risk of subsequent factors than those who underwent conservative care.  The look like vertebroplasty was way worse for those patients.  So they look at all of their the other variable they'd collected and they look and the age between the two groups with similar about 79. It looked at the weigh in kilograms. That was pretty balanced between the groups for what different was smoking status. So there was 55% of the people in this group were smokers were only 8% were smokers over here. So the smoking status differs greatly between the two groups.  We can do in this case is you can stratify the results and you can to stratify them. I split them up based on that variable. So if we split it up face on those who smoke and those who don't smoke weed then see that there's 21% and 19% Now that got their subsequent fractures. So the relative risk is 1.1 vs 7 and 8% in the no smoke proof. So now it's pretty balanced for subsequent fractures between the two groups.  So the take-home here is that I have and not look at smoking. They would have said that were real classy was way worse than Cancer Care, which doesn't happen to be the case. It's really that smoking status difference between the two groups met any questions for people move on. So we're helping to jupyter notebook. Open it up make a copy save it to your Google Drive run the first two coats out when he's on his press pay for those of you were in the room. I delete the clicker questions from this portion, so you're free to go. And if not, I'll see you Thursday for the deaf Fletcher.  Having trouble with this try and let me know that the Wi-Fi thing having trouble opening it.  52 Topps Willie. What are you should see something similar to this? You should be running these two cells. I'll be using the slides.  All right, we'll get started at this point.  So we didn't finish up data visualization last time so we're going to start where we left off there. I wanted to remind everybody about the data said that we were using so this is that Titanic dataset that we use for the data visualization the first time so we're doing is loading in the data set which comes with the Seaborn package and taking a look at the rows and Columns of these information about the passengers on the Titanic. So we're just using this dataset as a way to generate some basic visualisations and take a look at them. We just got off like last time we did box plaits and we did a Hyster has a density plot going to finish up with bar chart before looking at a quick exploratory data analysis today.  So what happened to mention is that there are two different versions of bar chart in the SeaWorld package. Does he born is that package were using for basic data visualization and there are two types of bar chart. How far is the one that's been display? The number of values you have within a category or cross a categorical variable or what is a son that group's buy a categorical Colin and then plus the heights of the bars according to the average of a numerical column width in each group. I'm going to show you this one just as an example and then talk about the fact that a box plot is really what you would want to use your most likely be using the count plot function with in the Seaborn package dogs play with the pots. So here is an example of count pot. What we see is to call it. We use SNS. We determine that we want a count slot. We then determine the X VFX is so the group we want to categorize died and then specify where the gate is that come from. So it's that Titanic dataset what we see  Is the number of people who were alive from the Titanic versus the number who did not survive?  Government, where a better case, I want chocolate at the fact that you can break this down by multiple variable. So this was that grouped bar chart that we talked about at the second date of visualization lecture. So it's very similar. Were you still specify what you want on the x-axis? So that's that alive variable. We still specify the data set, which is Titanic. But in order to break it down by a second variable you specify q and the respect that I hear want to break it down by class. So you can see that the vast majority of people were at first class but there were a number of people in second and third class on the Titanic in our data set is still using complex because what were you showing here are the count of individual within each group within the categorical variables?  What what is what I mentioned that I was going to tell you about that you won't use often because a boxplot would be more informative. So that's what I hear noticed that this now says barplot account. But if you break it down by the number who were alive and who weren't what this is plotting is really the mean age within the variables. So if we were to calculate those that means you see that we didn't know it would be 8:41 ish and with an e f g 32 ish. So all this part is communicating to you is the mean difference between a 2 and you can determine the differences in medians much more easily and look at the spread of the variable to whether or not there are outliers in a box plot. So instead of using flower pot on often you'll just want to generate a box pop. I wanted you to know what bar plot was just so you remember when to use count plot  So I'm going over there to you all. Can you generate a bar plot for embark town by deckhand? Make sure you consider whether or not this is a count plot or a bar flat.  And I'll give people a few more seconds rich and if you're stuck because you can't get it to open.  Could you can't get the data set to load in?  If you're stuck and having trouble people's next you can help feel free to come up at the end and I'll chat with you about it so number if you would figure it out.  I'm going to demonstrate an answer here. So the first line is probably similar to those of you who are able to successfully make the bar Pazzo. You have to specify that. We're going to use count from Seaborn. We wanted in barktown on the x-axis. We're going to break it down by deck and we're going to use the data that Titanic go to the second one just to demonstrate and this wouldn't have had to occur in your answer to fully understand. It is the Emmaus spotted your Legend on top of your data so you can move it to the upper right by specify where you want the latest the labels that was just to make it a slightly clearer visualization. All you needed was this first line plot of our town by the deck q and datasets. Yeah, I so we can see that the Embark Town Queenstown with much less popular than getting on in Southtown Southampton or starboard.  That was finishing up at the data visualization last time so we've gone over how to make Scatter Plots and fire pots pots pots and histograms identity V. I want to mention that for your projects and I'll try to mention this on Thursday quickly that you do not have to make beautiful thoughts. They don't have to be the best things that you've ever made. They should be exploratory. They should be basic we should know what's on them to be able to interpret them that they don't have to be the prettiest visualisations you ever made a data analysis you're talking about describing exploring and analyzing the data and we're going to use data that we've looked at before from stake survey data.  So these are data that were available from David at 5:38, I've talked about this before.  And the first step is to get the data set in and determine how many rows and columns you have what information you have and start to determine if data are missing. So to do this. I'm going to give you all a second to find this cell where you're reading in the stake data set.  And I'll just pause for a second. So people can find them find that sell.  I guess they want to run that they'll and you should see something that looks similar to what you have here that we have lots of information and Rose. We have lots of columns. The one thing I'll note is this first row just says response. So that's not really a response from any individual. It is just a weird thing in the day that we need to get rid of that last part of your exploratory analysis would be figuring out that there.  Get rid of that. So I went out of flight order there to get rid of that. We would use indexing as we talked about previously and would say that we want from the first meeting. Skip the zeros row and then include everything else after that if we looked at what it looks like now, we've gotten rid of that response row and we just have responses from actual individuals in the dataset.  We can then determine the shape of the data. So we know we have 551 Rose and 15 column. So we have information from lots of people in the dataset and lots of questions that they were asked on the survey questions or appear information about risky Behavior information about gender and age and some socioeconomic status stuff.  And you want to determine whether or not they're missing values here and the one we're going to look at it is to see if you look across the holidays at the 219 roads have missing data. So lots of missing data the variable we're going to care about is steak preference. So we're just going to look at that and we'll see that 118 people didn't answer the question. How do you like your steak prepared which means that 21.4% of the individuals did not answer the questions that something you'd want to keep in mind in urinalysis.  The next thing is we want to explore the variables explore the relationships. So do you see what you expect are there wild outliers so we want to see what the values are for steak preference. And the idea here is I want you all to generate a plot that fought the responses to the how do you like your steak prepared? And then if you've figured out, press a and if you haven't Presby  All right. I'll give people a few more seconds.  All right.  Accessory again account plot because we're looking at a categorical variable broken down and we want the counts in each of them by default. It will post put these in order that doesn't necessarily make all that much then to a fence post as we want rare to be the first one. They medium rare medium medium. Well well  So you can control this and I'm just including this before a for your information. So if he's what you see here is really count but you need the variable you're interested in to be in quotes. It has to have the? Include exact the name of the column you specify the name of the dataset. So steak is a name we gave it and then you can stop by the order that you want them to appear in and I just change the color to gray because you don't really need different colors and all them. So this is just a machine that you can change the appearance and order on a bar plot.  So that's a little bit better about the relationship to other variables. What if you wanted to look at how preference and how you like your steak done breakdown by male and female in the gender cat so you can again book BCBS similar numbers of males and females in the dataset.  But if you want to see whether or not there's an effect in the difference in state preference by gender you would be able to generate a plot to look at that. So I'm going to give you all a second to do that and I'll open it up to determine the pot there and then we'll I don't like that.  I'll give you a few more seconds.  Are even number of people to go down some that are stuck. So if you're stuck at the end, please, let me know what you're stuck on and I can help you through it. The idea would be that you would have here plotted a count what you would have determine how you like your steak preference on the x-axis and then broken it down by gender so we can see here that there's a big difference within those two prefer their steak medium and those who prefer well in opposite directions.  So in this way movie did exploratory analysis real looking at how many rows and columns with variables we have is stuff missing. What's the relationship between the variables and it's a similar what you'll do for your exploratory analysis in your assignments this week. I'll see you off Thursday for the guest lecture. "
