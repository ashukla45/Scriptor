  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started.  So what do I question here in just a little bit, but I want to start off with the normal.  By the way, for those of you and the front basically for all of you in any row, but mostly in the prime when it rains here at UCSD podcast.  All right.  I don't get the adrenaline going.  Look, I stomped one of them up here and it just hissed at me.  Okay.  So I'm exam to most of you know, that most of this information stuff I gave last time but I just wanted to go through it again real quickly. The average was 54% was a good good average. That's what you should be. Seeing as exams get more more difficult and that's reflective of the average that you're going to see on a final exam unless you go and make sure you know how to do those problems Ron that last midterm the  People have asked me what's the best way to study for good to to learn this stuff. And then she asked me multiple times is the best way to learn how to do this stuff do the practice test do the test again, you're only going to get good at Problems by doing them by the repetition and it becomes sort of a recognition issue more than anything else. You should recognize how to do certain types of problems. You took the test with you. So you have it so don't come and ask me for the test cuz you got it answers to the Scantron to the whole test basically are on Triton Ed if they're very top of the document that has what you put on your Scantron.  Are volumetric lab is tomorrow is the last wetlab? Remember? You still have all the requirements lab coat long pants, etcetera Etc. If you are prepared for this experiment when you come in won't take very long. Actually, very quick experiment. And actually the lab reports pretty as is not too bad for this one it is however, one of those ones you need to be prepped for when you come in. I mean ionic reactions lab is due today by noon. I think I saw people turning it up there when I was on my way down the volume metric lab is due. Next. Tuesday is a short turnaround because next week is the last week. Obviously no mechanical is it was 13.7 out of 25 55% normal. Like I said before you should be able to get the nomenclature quiz is back in your lab tomorrow. I have them I'm going to  Put them with the th can get after them and they should have them and be able to give them back to you. If you asked them. They'll remember to go get them. I would have put them somewhere where I'm finally final exam info is coming sooner. This is the reason I put this up is because  I have requested I've requested us to be to have the final exam in a much bigger room the rec gym. In fact, if we get it, I won't know until today or tomorrow. So keep your eyes open. It is possible that they may say and it makes it is possible that you might see on train Ed that it tells us we're going to a different room.  I will make sure that announcements on Ted and in class tell you where the final exam is. The time is still the same day is still the same. It's Tuesday, December 11th at 8 a.m. Wherever we're going to have it. We are if we have to be in this room. I'm going to try to get an overflow room as well so that we have enough room for for everybody to spread out to be every other seat. So we're not all jammed in like we are doing regular exams. I'm alright, so I want to go before I go to questions in just a little bit here. I do want to go back to finish this question up a question that I had asked you to do on your own and  The first thing that you have to do in a question like this anytime you give it a question where it's written in words or it's written out without a chemical equation the very first thing you need to write a balanced chemical equation. If you don't write a balanced chemical equation not going to be able to do the problem and there are ways around this but you were more of those when you get in the Kim 6 b r 6 B instructor should explain to you some of the some of the reasons some of the ways we can get around having a balanced chemical equation. If we only need for example certain connections between the components. So in this thing, I wrote the very first the very first equation is at the top of the slide is HCl + NaOH + H2O. + NaCl is an example of what we talked about last time. This is an example of what's known as a neutralization reaction.  And again a neutralization reaction is nothing more than an acid base reaction where water is one of the products. It is the term. It's still an acid base reaction. Don't get me wrong. It is a specific class of these know something that I didn't talk about last time was we're being very general in Howard calling real calling reactions were saying that reactions are for example of redox reactions acid base reactions double displacement reaction, but there are subcategories of all of all of these types of reaction. Most notably there are subcategories of redox reaction. There are reactions known as decomposition reactions their reactions, for example of decomposition reaction would be something like this.  We're hgo as a solid.  After you heat it gives Mercury as a liquid.  + oxygen gas so we would need two of these and two of those that's an Exacta to redox reaction against a redox reaction because we're taking a compound or breaking it down to its elements but it goes by a specific kind of redox reaction is known as a decomposition. You're taking one material and breaking it down into what makes it up. There are combination reactions combination reaction will be the opposite of this. There are things known as disproportionation. There are things known as comprar Porsche Nation there still redox reactions, but there are classes of redox reactions. And again, you're going to learn this.  You should.  Learn this in 6A again, but I'm going to tell you something in the South podcast.  Being sexy instructors don't really care whether you're sick stay and structure Tata to you or not. Okay, and that's the thing. You need to understand every class. If you have a different instructor every time they structure before the next II instructor you have is always going to say will you supposed to learn this in the last class? And if you didn't that's not good. It's just one of those things all  Please remember that if there are if it says in the syllabus covering chapters 1 through 10, make sure that even if there's not a lot of coverage on chapter 10, for example last always get short short shift because I have to if you run out of time you run out of time. Make sure you cover those chapters. I'm alright, so let's go through this and I did this on the next flight to get all post these lights tonight for you to 1 to go through.  So here so here's what we're going to do.  In this problem I put asterisks by the by the three things that we need to look at. The first thing we need to do is we need to we need to know from the balanced chemical equation. We know that the moles of NaOH used is equal to the moles of HCL that was originally present of this comes right out of the store Kiama tree in the balanced chemical equation. Remember the question here is what was the molarity of the HCL solution you started with you took 50 mils of that.  The moles of HCL / the volume of the HCL that you originally used that was 50. Ml is equal to the molarity of the HCL Solution. That's what we're looking for. But there's one other piece of information in that in in the in this a problem that you need to go back to go back to that. I want pulling out here and that is this  It says here that into a burette is placed the material and the initial reading is .55. The final reading at the endpoint to be retreating is 33 point is 33.87 at the final reading. This is something you're going to be doing tomorrow in lab. That's why I want you to know how to do this in a few rat. You read the burette from the top to the bottom. Okay. You always need to record what the initial volume is.  Once you finish doing your titration you record the final volume. Okay, and so the actual volume of the material that you put into your flask.  Is the stuff from the pier at is the final volume minus the initial volume, which is like on the next slide here.  So the volume of NaOH used is equal to the final volume.  What is the final volume reading? I should say minus the initial burette reading? Okay, and that's the very first piece of information that we need. So we ended at 33.87 but it started it didn't start 0 it started .55. So if I subtract 33.55 from 33.87 I get 33.32 ml. Okay. Now we need leaders.  because we're using moles per liter and here's a trick that I use and something that you can think about using and that is if you remember  If you remember.  that one milliliter is equal to  10 - 3  Then if you have something like 50, ml you can simply take that.  and keep the 50 and put x 10 to the -3 leaders behind where this allows you to get rid of that Millie it makes  It makes life simpler. Another words. There's no reason to convert that Millie into whatever you need to do your not sorry if you do this, cuz if you do this, your answer will be the same. Okay, so the trick this is a trick that we use when we don't want to mess around with the actual number is his other words instead of saying it's 5.0 x 10 to the -2 and 50 x 10 to the -3 and we taking care of that trick. You don't have to do it but it works like this is what I've done here. So  Set the volume of the NaOH and I've used is 33.32 X 10 to the -3 leaders. Now in any titration problem like this. You must be aware of your sig figs.  Because your answer this is where sig figs really do come in. Our important answer has got to have the right number of significant figures what readings direct readings are always to four significant figures.  If your rent readings are always to four significant figures when you use a volumetric pipette.  They are almost always to four significant figures as well.  So again, you need to keep track of yours of your sig figs here. So having said that we have  we have .15 to for moles per liter the sodium hydroxide that was the molarity of sodium hydroxide. We multiply that by 33.32 x 10 to the -3 leaders that tells us that the amount of sodium hydroxide be used.  Was 5.080 X 10-3 moles of sodium hydroxide again, I have four sig figs. So I'm walking that for sig figs through.  I did a rounding in this one.  Stoichiometry tells me I have one mole of HCL for every one mole of sodium hydroxide, which means that the amount of HCL I have is 5.080 X 10 to the -3 moles of HCL. So now I know how many moles of HCL now it's time to convert that to molarity. That's a relatively simple Prospect. I simply take the moles of HCL that were present which I figured out from the moles of sodium hydroxide and I divided by the initial amount of a CLI putting which was 50.00 milliliters.  So I put that I put my Express that and leader so I could get molarity 5.080 x 10 to the -3 moles of HCL / 50.00 x 10 to the -3 liters of a CL is equal to 0.101 six to four sig figs molar ACL and again Note 2 sig figs in these kind of our real loud experiment, especially titration experiment that are extremely accurate.  Okay, make sure you know how to do a problem like this cuz you will see this again in a little over a week.  A mine has a sheet of other acids and bases know I put this slide in.  because  while you're  we've already talked a little bit about this. Okay, for example what we can say our things like  We can say we've already said this that strong acids.  and bases  completely ionized  ionize or dissociate is really what we're talking about here is for the break apart into the irons that make it up we can stay that weak acids.  I'm going to limit this to weak acids right now.  partially  ionize  Toro word something like hc2 H3 O2 which is acetic acid.  Stays approximately 90%  as  hc2 H3 O2 is this  when an acid reacts with a base, however  It doesn't matter whether it's strong or weak. They if they react with bases exactly the same way. So acetic acid will react with sodium hydroxide exact same way is HCl does.  Kate The Forum water  No, the reason I really put this light in is because there are acids and bases that ionize in water, but they ionize in a different way. Now. I'm going to I'm going to talk about the one important exception.  Are the one important one and that is ammonia.  NH3 aqueous  First of all start off with number one. Ammonia is not a liquid. Ammonia is a gas at room temperature. Ammonia is a gas. Well when you clean something home, you take a bottle of ammonia from under the sink.  What's that bottle bottle of ammonia the bottle of ammonia from under the sink is ammonia gas that has been dissolved in water or NH3 aqueous when you put ammonia into water.  What happens is you make?  nh4 + aqueous  plus oah minus aqueous.  And so ammonia in water.  NH3 aqueous  is actually nh4oh aqueous ammonium hydroxide. That's how you see it written and this is something that we do. This is one of these small nice things. You just need to know.  Certain at certain acids and bases will ionize differently than you're used to seeing the most common one is ammonia. That's why we used to do sit at this point in time. The most common one is ammonia. It is the one that you're going to see the most going to see this happen to the most today.  So what are these kind of things you should do? You should just simply learn how to do.  Okay.  Miss watching a guy play on his phone here.  By the way, you should put your phone's on vibrate or on I know what the sound of a text coming in look sounds like  I put mine on vibrate because if I don't  People in my house always look at my phone to see who's texting me. All right.  Which isn't good one my own nevermind. Alright?  So let's go over to this question that ends that ends modulate. The next module going to do is the Heat and the Heat won. Let's go over to this.  And do a question today.  She'll get about a minute more on this one.  K 30 seconds  You should not take you 4 minutes the balanced equation.  most of you have done long before that some  okay, see what you got.  And the correct answer is he indeed see kind of a reaction is this?  Classify the reaction for me. What kind of reaction is it?  Every action is it folks?  It's a redox reaction.  Redox reaction. How do you know it's a redox reaction?  What's the big clue that tells you what's a redox reaction?  There's an element in its Elemental form being used and there's one being made up.  Anytime you have a equation like this a redox reaction where there is an element in its Elemental form on the starting material side always balanced bat Element last it's always going to make it easier for you.  And so again, make sure you know how to balance this equation. And like I said most of the class 80% of did it and did it correctly, which is a good thing. So,  so again  What's some close this up? Because the Kim?  For a 40 people are going to have one to all right, let's go back over here. And now talk about module B now. This is a topic.  Is there a topic that I put at the end of toward the end of camp where there's one more thing? We're going to have to do and what are the things you need to do? This weekend is start reading and doing the lowest the Lewis structure worksheet start reading through that Lewis structure material and start doing the worksheet. That's due a week from Friday, not tomorrow but a week from Friday and I'll and I'll tell you about that next week. The reason I put in our module b i call this energy flow in heat because if we didn't get time to do it in camphor and this happens this has happened in the past when we've had fallen San Diego could be Fire season and we've had times when we've lost almost a week of class because of fires when that happens, we have to have some disposable topic some topics that we can we can kick out nose. I usually put towards the end of the avocado.  This is one of them.  When we have enough time to do it, which we do this year. I want I always think it's important for you to do this to see this because once you get out of this class, once you move to Kim 6 a.m. Particularly 6 p.m. 60 energy becomes one of the key topics that you're going to talk about and it is a key topic for all science courses pretty much from here on okay. So what we want to do is why I want to do here is give you an introduction to heat. Now you seen some of these problems in the homework already earlier in the corner. There was a heat capacity questions woman wasn't that interested in you doing at that time? So before we start to say a few things  The study of chemical reactions is known as thermodynamics is one of the most important topics you're going to cover in your first year of chemistry and we're underlying theme in all of your stem studies forward energy is a topic that plays very very heavily chemistry biology physics medicine pretty much you engineering pretty much name it we will not go into more depth in our coverage here. That's necessary. I'm going to present the energy Concepts. It'll give you a picture of how chemistry and energy fit together really how science and energy fit together.  Some of the conventions that we talked about are not going to sound are not going to going to be a little unclear as to why we're doing it that way. I'm going to try to explain that to you. Okay?  What's going to happen is if they're you have to start thinking about cyst you have to start thinking about what you're studying as being what's called a system and you have to start asking yourself what is happening to the energy of the system that you're studying? So for example, you are a system so when you eat breakfast  What's happening to the energy of you as a system?  It should be gaining energy. That's why you're eating. Okay, as you go out running for those of you go out running. I don't mess I mean Chase.  and even then  Depends on what I have on me. So again if you're running  What's happening to the energy of the u.s. System?  It's going down you're expending energy. So we have to come up with a convention. So what is the convention will a convention has to do with the sign and this is where sign becomes very important if your energy is going up.  That wasn't Siri.  If your energy is going up.  Then we're going to say that that's a positive sign.  When your energy is being depleted where to call that a mine is sun. In other words a sign of energy flow is going to be a function of the system that you're looking. So let's take a look at this in a little more detail here in it to do with heat and work.  Thermodynamics has to do with other things in addition to heat and work Concepts that are very very that are not going to be clear to you. And so we're going to try to stay away from  a nerd but heat and work are two concepts that most students can understand.  Thermochemistry is the branch of thermodynamics that deals with the heat involved with chemical and physical changes also deals with the work, but mostly the heat because we don't really cover the work of chemical reactions until we get into chemistry 60 and we talked about electrochemistry.  Self is a study and measure the nature of heat and energy and its Transformations and energy can be transferred energy cannot be.  Cannot be made can either be created or destroyed it can only be transferred from one type to another.  Energy flow with key in science, if you understand how the energy flow occurs, then you can understand why things are occurring. I beat this into all of my general chemistry students. I beat this into my organic students understanding the energy flow.  Gives you an idea why one process will happen.  versus another  and this is this is not some of something that you really think about until you are faced with making a decision as to what kind of reaction.  What's going to happen?  so  Robin give you an example this lady as we go on I'll talk about this. Okay, the energy the unit of energy we're going to use is the jewel now Jewel if I remember correctly is a Newton meter per second. Whatever that those are. Okay. We don't use that we use was called the combined unit, which is called the jewel.  Another unit that gets used occasionally we won't use it in here very much is the kilocalorie.  Kilocalorie is a different units in Old unit that that was used for years. It still gets used in organic chemistry and biochemistry mostly because it's just one of those things been ingrained calorie. By the way. That's the thing that most of you don't think you know, what a calorie is. Okay, when you look on the back of a candy bar, it says calorie K Cal write a capital c 200  calories  that capital c  Is how manufacturers decided to use KCAL?  McAuliffe candy bar that you just ate that's 200 calories is actually 200 kilocalories or 200 x 10 is a 3 calories. Okay. Now again, if you was 200000 calories candy bars que no actually would but that's beside the point.  What is also tells us to something else the unit of energy is really pretty small, okay?  If you think about how many calories does it take a person on a given day, how many calories do you need to take in? And he answer is somewhere between 1200 and 1500 depending on your level of activity. That's about what you need to keep the functions in your body going.  Anything less than that?  If you're taking in has to come from you at the come from breaking down protein breaking down fat breaking down muscle, okay?  And here's a big here's a thing. You're the thing to know.  Diets don't work very well. Do they know why because your body cuz you think one would be burning fat your body burns fat.  Only until I can figure out how to burn protein.  It takes a little while to figure it out and say okay. I'm going to burn the fat and when I put them in an amp the system up to do protein will then you start to lose muscle mass. So that's why these some of the best diets. Are these kind of Yoyo type of diet where you go from paleo to Atkins and then two tablets to whatever they are.  And by the way, just so you know.  That's because we had to have a minor and it looked and sounded interesting. Okay?  To deal with this snow by the way, I juul. How big is a juul a juul is the amount of energy it takes for your heart to beat once.  That's how small it is. The jewel is the amount of energy it takes for your heart to beat once somebody told me one time a jewels off is the amount of energy it takes for a butterfly to flap its wings once or twice. I don't remember that one. That's true or not. But the heart when I do remember  I'm sorry talk about this stuff. We have to  discuss because thermodynamics and thermochemistry deal with large collections of molecules. We have to we have taken with talk about three parameters the system and surroundings and something called universe.  And see what they are First Energy a juul is 1 kg per meter squared per second squared which I believe is a Newton meter per second. I think I Newton is a kilogram meter per second. So now why do I put this down like this? I just want you to know it is made up of fundamental units, but you're never going to use those fundamental units less you unless you talk about some aspects where you need to but not in this class. You won't see the jewel is that's what the jewel is in essence. The jewel is the amount of energy required to move 1 kg  to accelerate kilogram of mass  meter squared per second squared per second squared meters per second squared to accelerate 1 kilogram through a meter.  Kilometer to accelerated calorie is the other one we use is 4.184 joules to a calorie is 4 times bigger than a juul so if 1 joules the amount of energy takes for your heart to beat once one calorie and lowercase C is not a kilocalorie. Yes. It is some kind of calories. You see in the back food means your heart to beat four times with that British thermal unit is one we never use but BTUs are used primarily when you're talkin about heaters.  Suppose you are going to engineering 1 BTU is about 1100 1050 1005 5 joules. What does 55 jewels?  What are these three terms we talked about? Well, the little picture on the left hand side is sort of what I've created to sort of explain is to you.  The system is the part of the universe.  Of immediate interest. It's what we are studying. Okay.  Is composed of particles with their own internal energy in internal energy?  In chemistry and science is either given a capital e or a capital u internal energy is the sum of all of the energies that go into that particle. Its kinetic energy is potential energy all that kind of stuff kinetic and potential is what we're going to deal with here. Okay. The system is what we are studying.  The system could be a block of hot metal that you dumped into water.  The system could be the actual chemicals. They are reacting with one another the system could be you your biological system as it's burning energy as it's making as it's making more ATP.  Systems come in three flavors. They can be closed open or isolated talk about what those are in a minute the surroundings or everything else.  So if you are studying a chemical reaction like the one that's written on the board Mercury oxide decomposes into mercury and oxygen gas if you're studying that.  That's your system. The surroundings are the water that is being done in.  It is the Bell jar that you might have this in the beaker that it's in the air around beaker.  Everything that's not part of the system is the surroundings and a thing that you should get immediately. Is it the surroundings are much much bigger.  Dennis system  Okay, for example, what would happen to the temperature?  Elvis swimming pool  if you poured one cup of water into that swimming pool.  Would the temperature of the swimming pool chain that change to any measurable amount?  And the answer is no.  And so sometimes we call the surroundings a heat bath or a cooling bath the surrounding so when were talking about the sign of energy in general?  when energy is going into  a system  that energy sign is defined as positive when the energy of the system goes up because you're putting energy into it that's positive.  When energy is leaving the system.  The energy of the system is going down that is defined as a negative energy the loss of energy systems to become more stable will lose energy gaining energy puts the system at a higher energy Point losing energy drops it down and everything goes from high to low.  So the natural process for system is to lose energy. But here's another thing. Where is this energy coming from coming from the surroundings? Where is it going? It's going into the surroundings. So the energy sign of the surroundings, which we are not going to discuss.  is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign so if for example  12 joules  Let's say for example.  If I put 12 Jewels into the system from the system standpoint.  The energy is + 12.  from the surrounding standpoint  It's -12 joules. Okay. Now this is the part. We're not going to worry about the surroundings or something. You'll talk about in chemistry 6C. They are important they are important but for different reasons, okay. So what are the three types of systems that we see the three types of systems that we see are open systems closed systems and isolated open systems exchange both energy and matter with the surroundings a closed system exchanges only energy with the surroundings.  An isolated system is exactly that it is isolated from the surroundings. And so it cannot exchange matter nor can exchange energy with the surroundings. So what are real examples of this and open system is like a test tube.  Where you can put chemicals in and take them out an automobile is an example of an open system you put gasoline in it burns the gasoline to make energy that heats some of the energy is lost as heat that goes into the surrounding. So does the byproducts of burning gasoline go into the environments or exchanging both matter and energy with the surroundings?  A closed system best example is a battery.  if the battery doesn't leak  it is a closed system you put energy into the battery.  When you recharge it or whatever.  And you get that energy back when you use the battery.  So it can exchange only.  It can exchange only energy with the surroundings and isolated system is something like a perfect thermos.  Where are you put coffee in the thermos?  in the morning  If the thermos is perfect, none of the coffee will escape from that thermos nor will any of the any of the energy now, the energy can be transferred from one type of energy to another from kinetic energy of moving to potential energy.  Exactly what that means we won't get any but no energy leaves the system. So in an isolated system  In an isolated system, one of the things that we can say here.  Is that during the course of anything the change in the energy is equal to zero?  or internal energy never changes  Now are isolated systems realistic and the answer is no but if we use the isolated system.  to Define everything or interested in as far as the thermochemistry and thermodynamics go  We can make guesses about the other ones now. That's just one of the reasons about isolated systems in a lot of detail and Kim 6p and Kim 6c.  So  what is internal energy? Well again, it's the total energy is contained within the system.  It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy this system that are due to changes in its internal State going from a gas to a liquid liquid to gas liquid to solid solid to gas particles moving faster.  As you increase the temperature of the particles move faster as the temperature goes down two particles move slower. All this thing comes into the internal energy. The internal energy can be changed by transferring matter in and out by transferring heat or by transferring work.  But one thing that we can always say is this we're going to use the sign Delta.  Delta means change  we can always say that the change in the internal energy of a system where the change in the energy of a system is going to be equal to the energy.  of the final system  minus the energy  office system initially  and this is true in accounting.  in general  the change in the in any parameter  is the final is the state of the final system - where it was when you started this is why energy can be either positive or negative.  if the system  loses energy  if the system loses energy get a minus sign if the system gains energy you get a positive sign okay over here. You can see what we're talking about here. The initial state is higher energy than the final state. So energy has to be lost. So lost at the surroundings for the for the for the example on the right.  The initial state is lower in energy than the final because energy came in from the surroundings and increase the energy of the final state.  Work is the thing that we don't talk much about but I wanted to just introduce it to you here were Kismet is is motion against an opposing Force easiest way to look at work is that work is a directed flow of energy.  Work is a directed flow of energy. You push a chair. You're pushing that chair in One Direction is it directed flow of energy heat on the other hand is a chaotic flow of energy. There is no Direction.  Heat flow except in or out of the system, but work is where you accomplished something. Okay.  We're interested in work because if we're using a chemical system like a battery to do something.  We want to be able to know how much work we can get out of that system because there's something that always competes with work and that's Heat.  Heat loss. Any energy lost by heat being given off is energy that can be used for work.  Any energy that's being lost as heat is energy. You can't use work for you can't do what you can't you can't use for work.  number of types of  with their number types of work than it really is are two types of expansion non expansion expansion is what it sounds like by the by the way expansion also includes contraction a system getting bigger or system getting smaller like a piston, okay?  But there is one other kind of work. It is also important to point out and that is non-expansion work.  Non-expansion work is where the work being done is not the system changing its size or its length rather. The work is being done by for example, pushing and electron from one place to another or pulling an electron from one place to another this is what it electrical work is all about. This is as much as we're going to talk about work.  What's a much more complicated topic?  That we are not going to spend time talking about or calculating except for one except with one example, except for one thing and you'll do a lot of that and Kim 60 in a little + 6 + 6 B but she is the one that most people are familiar with. Okay. Now let me simply say let me simply say this that the internal energy as a whole.  is equal  To the work that the system either does or has done on it plus.  the Heat  to the internal energy of a system is a mitt is is the sum of the work plus the Heat.  Whether the system is doing work or having work done on it.  When is the system is gaining heat or losing heat the some of those two together gives us the change or gives us the internal energy of the system just by the way is what's known as the first.  law  a thermodynamics  you heard the first law of thermodynamics expressed. In other ways. You probably heard it said energy can neither be created nor destroyed. And that's the one that must the one most people have heard the actual official definition of it. Is that  the internal energy of a system  Is equal to the sum of the work plus the Heat?  And actually that's official on your journey real of fish 1 + 60.  but essentially what the first law of thermodynamics is that  Energy can be transferred from one type of energy to another.  and they must  add up to the total energy of the system system and surroundings and heat transfer systems and surroundings have to be a different temperature because he can only be transferred.  From a hot system to a cold system from a hot body to a cold body from hot to cold high temperature to low temperature.  If no work is done.  In other words, if your vessel did not expand or Your Vessel didn't contract the change in the energy of the system is only due to the heat that was transferred.  Interesting Lee. This is true.  This is true in closed systems and closed systems.  Closest is where it's no expansion or contraction or being seen all energy is transferred by sheet across that now a battery is different because we do have an opening for that but different.  Temperature is not heat and that's something you need to realize temperature is nothing more than a measure of the relative hotness or coldness of an object.  So if I said, it's hot today, okay, it's hot today.  well  It depends on where I am.  If I'm in the middle of Alaska in winter and I say it's hot today.  hot could be -10 degrees  HD - 20 degrees because normally it's minus 40 if I'm in the middle of the Sahara and I say it's cold today that could be a hundred degrees.  Because it's normally 120 so it's a relative term.  But what's not relative is the change in temperature?  That is something that we can use.  So that white sheep ears, he is directly proportional to the change in the temperature of a system delta-t kelvins or Centigrade Celsius. We are not going to use Fahrenheit here.  Delta-t is the same.  the change in the temperature T final minus t initial  k  the change in the temperature  will be the same whether the initial and the final temperature are both in Centigrade or both in Kelvin.  Kind of changing the temperature cuz he can't be that the same day of the same basic scale.  One thing that we can always say is this that the heat is equal to mine at the heat of the system and if there's no subscript on whenever we're talking about we're talking about the system the heat of the system.  Is equal to -2 heat of the surrounding in other words?  Whatever heat is gained by the system was lost by the surroundings. Whatever heat is lost by the system is gained by the surroundings and other word is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign.  So the heat gained by a cold body is equal to the heat lost by the hot body.  Exothermic vs. Endothermic  exothermic  XO means out  Endo means in an exothermic reaction is a reaction where  The system gives off Heat or the system is losing energy heat is what we talkin about particularly here.  Endothermic is where the system is gaining heat or gaining energy from the surroundings.  Now we don't use the term sheet as much as we used the term enthalpy.  Enthalpy is given the capital letter H. This is on the board.  I am now what's enthalpy is?  Enthalpy is the heat lost or gained by a system at constant pressure.  Enthalpy is the heat lost or gained by a system at constant pressure. The reason the term enthalpy gets used more than Heat, by the way, when we talk about enthalpy, we are talking about heat. We're just talking about it at constant pressure. The reason we use this is because almost all reactions that we study almost all systems that we study are at constant pressure.  The pressure isn't changing.  The heat absorbed or released by a system is a function of three things.  It's a function of the mass of the system whether it's in grams or moles, depending on the next one the next thing of something called we use the letter capital c for call the heat capacity.  The ability to heat to hold on to heat and the change in temperature or we can say the Q is equal to M the mass time see the heat capacity. Where do you see some ass? I'll tell you why in a minute.  Best answer the specific heat capacity X the change in the temperature.  So what is the specific heat capacity?  All of you should know and if you don't I'm going to tell you.  It is it takes less energy to heat up an aluminum.  And then it does a cast iron pan.  It takes less energy to heat up an aluminum pan does a cast iron pan of the same weight know I can give this to you even but even a better one.  If you were to put cookies.  an aluminum cookie sheet  bake your cookies on an aluminum cookie sheet vs. Cast iron.  Cookie sheet and took them out of the oven.  Which one would you be a witch cookie sheet, would you be able to touch sooner?  I said experiment for you to try but don't when you go to the hospital with your burn fingers. Don't blame me the aluminum one. Why because the heat capacity not only tells us.  Is not only a function of saw the ability of how much heat it takes to warm something up. It's also the ability of a measure of how it holds onto the heat. So something with high heat capacity.  With a large heat capacity number takes more energy to heat up.  What is hold on to that heat longer?  something with a lower heat capacity  Heats up fast but it loses that heat. That's why gold and silver are used in the electronics Industry.  Because they heat up fast, but they also lose the energy quick and electrical components heat is your enemy.  Can I show to take a substance ability to absorb heat and account we come up with something all the specific heat capacity. It's the amount of heat required to raise 1 gram of that substance.  buy one degree Celsius or kelvin another words to change the temperature by 1 degrees Celsius or one degree Kelvin, which is that same 1\u00b0 k  Now there's another heat capacity to get used and I'm going to introduce this. It's one you won't see me use very much in his class of it all and that sees the damn Cecil B M is the molar.  heat capacity  the difference between the molar heat capacity to specific heat capacity specific were talking about mass in grams molar heat capacity were talking about math as expressed as moles the only difference  Molar heat capacity is more useful. When you start doing some of the more esoteric calculations in thermochemistry and thermodynamics more specific heat capacity is what we use when we want to talk about how much heat does it take to warm a cup of coffee? How much heat does it take or how much he will an aluminum pan absorb something like that.  Materials with small heat capacities heat up quickly and they lose heat. By the way. This is true whether it smaller or specific materials with small heat capacity heat up quickly and Lucy quickly materials with large heat capacity heat up slowly and lose heat slowly here is a table of heat capacities the molar ones on the far right on here. Okay. So for example,  Look at look at something new. Let's see a good one on here.  Let's look at stainless steel versus I don't have aluminum on here. Do I know?  So for example, if you look at this thing look at marble.  Versus or polyethylene versus stainless steel polyethylene takes 2.3 as heat capacity of 2.3 stainless steel .51 that mean stainless steel is going to take less energy to heat up. It's also going to let that energy going to let that heat go faster than polyethylene, but on this list.  Honest list what compound has the highest heat capacity?  water  water has the highest capacity of almost any compound known this is one of the unique things about water. This is why it's always warmer.  Near near a lake is always warmer.  Venice City, that's not near a lake.  the water holds onto the heat longer  now the amount of water of heat to raise 10 grams of water 5 degrees C is a sip of coffee.  Is 209 joules that's how much it takes to raise 10 grams of water is 10 mL of water that last sip of coffee in your cup.  If you would have put the same amount of heat.  into 10 grams of gold  if you are with the same amount of heat in 10 grams of gold, it would change the gold temperature.  by 197 degrees  not by 5\u00b0, but by 197 that goes to show you how big of a difference there is between the Heat capacities of these things.  Here is the sign convention. We've already talked about this for q w n e.  Century it basically comes down to this any energy to put into the system.  Whether it's heat or work.  Is going to be positive any energy lost by the system.  Whether it's heat or work is going to be negative.  Delta Vee depends  in two of the cases  on the relative size of the Heat versus the work.  So find the quantity of heat from specific heat capacity. So let's say we have a layer of copper. It's welded to the bottom of a skillet and that pee and that piece of copper weighs 125 grams this by the way, these on this is how they get Skillets to heat up fast by putting a piece of copper on a copper has a low heat capacity.  How much heat is needed to raise the temperature of the copper layer from 25\u00b0 C to 300. The specific heat capacity of copper is 2.387 joules per gram Kelvin.  So what we're going to use if you remember from before the equation that want to use here, is that Q?  The heat is equal to the mass times specific heat capacity of the copper X delta T. So  Having looked at that what do we have here? I have written a little bit differently. There's the mass there.  There's the heat capacity.  There is the delta-t the final temperature is 300. That's what we're heating it up to we started at 20 k  the amount of heat required for this process  is 1.33 x 10 to the 4th Jewels or the way that you are more likely to see this is like this.  If I want to take this decimal place and move it over like this.  I would get 13.3 * 10 is 1/3 joules 10 to the third joules is kilojoules. So this would be 13.3 kilojoules. And in fact, this is how most heat?  When we talked about it is talked about in terms of kilojoules rather than Jewels themselves.  We'll talk about measuring heat from a calorimeter animals. Do a Lewis structure starting next week memory of a lab tomorrow and you have one you turn in today. See you next week. "
