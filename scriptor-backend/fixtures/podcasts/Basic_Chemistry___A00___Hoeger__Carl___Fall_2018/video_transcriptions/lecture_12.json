  "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. I'm so ready to come back to this question in a couple minutes. This is your question for the morning and you can do this without a calculator. At least you should be able to do this without a calculator.  So let me know. Let me go back over to the  to the iPad and go through this quickly just a few things to say before we get started here. You don't know the scores yet. I do. I have all the exams except for one set of we split the exams into into a six sets and I have everything except for the second set of urgency right now. The average looks to be in this is adjusted averaging about 58% pain 57 to 58% I expect to have a scores posted either later today or tomorrow sometime again, I'm waiting for one more one more set to 58% is an average is sort of normal in general chemistry. Stop going to be normal and 6 A-6 Azz after that 58% obihai, so it's actually pretty good, but it was not a hard test.  But again, what you need to do is once they're available for pickup, make sure you pick it up and make sure that you know how to do any of the problems that you didn't get correct on the answer is your posted up by my office right now except for the Scantron part that will go up on the web. But the written answers are posted up on my office. You can get it those you can get it though. You take pictures of them so you can see how to do the problem. There's three versions of the tasks so you could take a look and see what you've got iclicker to the end of week 5  Job is posted the maximum. I don't know why and I just blipped on if someone sent me an email last night you explain to me how I got 10 out of 16 when I've been here every class. I just didn't click in enough and then I realized wait a minute. Why did it say 16? And that's because it shouldn't have took an old setting of mine and just put it over. So I think maximum was 11/12, but I think it was 11:00. So if you have a score it's going to be something in it what matters more as to what it out of is to whether you have numbers or not. If you don't have numbers if you have a 0 of a line through it, you do need to see me because that means your iclicker is not registered and I don't care where you registered it.  If it's not registered in my buy me that it wasn't registered. So you need you need to look at that. You need to see me and again you have really until next Thursday to get this done. I want it done as quickly as possible. There is no class this Thursday or Friday. Now that happens because I have to be out of town and and while I could get someone to take over Kim for lecture the labs a different story in this is allowed that we're going to do the next Lab we're doing is What's called the ionic reactions lab reactions lab, which I will make available. Probably Thursday afternoon. The ionic reactions lab is probably one of the more complicated Labs we do. It's not hard just complicated cuz there's a there's there's must be forty bottles in the lab. So you have to add things so  I want to make sure that first alarm around for that because that is one at least in the morning to make sure that everything is is copacetic on that. So what I've done is this and I told all of you in this in the in the email you should have gotten what I did was I shifted all the labs down by one week. Now that works out really well and Kim for because the last week we don't really have a lot we haven't opened with an open slot even though it says check out there really is no check out. So what we're going to do is this Friday is no lab the lab reported to do on Thursday because I wasn't here. That's the one you just finished the Imperial.  Limiting reagent. Okay, that one will be due Tuesday November 13th Edwards next week on Tuesday by 11 a.m. At the turn and station. She gets a few more days to work on it. But you also have to turn in an hour earlier. Okay. So make sure that that's done. I will not accept late lab reports. So don't so don't follow that why you need a rapper 16th. That is a week from this Friday. We're doing the ionic reactions and activity series lab that is also in the nomenclature quiz will be it'll be in the beginning of lab. So don't miss it or you'll miss the nomenclature quiz the following week there has been no change. That's Thanksgiving Friday. So there is no lab on Thanksgiving Friday if you want to come and stand in for the lab go right ahead, but I'm going to be recovering from football and Thanksgiving and  craft brew  And then so because there is no class on Thursday or Friday of that because there is no no class on Thursday or Friday. What we're going to do instead is have that one is the next Lab is going to be turned in on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving. These are the two out of sequence. Now what you need to know. Is it everything that you turn into your ta like post lab questions pre lab discussions that all goes to your ta the next time you see them so you're not turning in those special. Those are just going you'll still be turning those in the lab, but you be turning them into your Tas at the next Lab you see them with so just don't sweat that it's only the lab reports cuz they have to go out for grading.  Friday November 30th is the volumetric analysis in titration lab and then the last lab Friday December 7th is Lewis structure and Vsepr this the last lab and the last Friday of the quarter. Now, this is a dry lab. And in fact, it's a dry. Lleva takes almost no time at all. So for all intents and purposes it is essentially like you still get sometimes we have to drop this load out and you just as well as worksheet. Basically the last Friday of the quarter. There's not much going on. So it's not going to really be a big deal, but you will have a worksheet.  Because you have class off on Thursday and Friday. It's doesn't mean that I don't expect you to work. I expect you to work on Stoichiometry limiting reagents that's going to be on the next test that she passed by the way hasn't changed. I also expect you to get caught up on all the self study modules in one of them. I want you to start looking at is a Lewis structure 1 granted. It might it is a self-study module. It'll take it might take you a little bit of time to get through it. But I want you to start doing that because you're especially over by Thanksgiving. I'm going to ask you to start working on that study for your nomenclature quiz next week get caught up on everything as much as you can that brings me to one more point before I go back to slide over here and has to do with am I passing the class when you see some of your scores on an exam? That's the first question that come to mind. I don't tell you this.  You haven't seen lab scores yet. If you haven't seen the the the lab reports course I have I seen some of them. I'm still waiting for some but I will tell you this in in general the lab report scores average between 70 and 75% of it is impossible. Don't take this as a as a challenge. It is impossible to fail this class if you turn Labs him  Hey, I mean damn near impossible. People tried and it come close by there. D's but if you turn it on if you turn in your lap actually take that back the only people I ever failed Kim Porter I can think of have been people just decided halfway to the class or not going to train labs in which I don't understand. You know, I mean, I think maybe they just want they want to go to UCSD. They figured the easiest way it was for me to fail him out. So as long as you're turning in Labs, don't worry about your lab scores where you think about what the average is in your section for post lab questions pre lab quizzes. That's a number that I use in essence be that with Olivia exams. Do the exams differentiate between A's B's and C's the labs along with you doing obviously the  Good lab report the labs along with doing the exams ensure you get seized C- in order to assure that you pass now again, I don't expect I know most of you have never seen a lot of this stuff before it's new to you. You're freaking out because your friend tells you they know everything. Well your friend is full of  What I do in the morning, okay ignore them.  The only thing that matters is how you progress in the class. Can you go from wherever you are now up and that's what it is. It's all about where you finish not where you start typically after exam to depending on how the scores on an exam to I usually set it up so that the final exam can count can replace either exam 1 or exam to why don't cows no matter what but I can make it so that the final exam can count for more for those of you who really bomb out on exam one. Where did you take exam 1 lb warn you about a warn you right now in exam 2 and the final exam look more like an exam one and the final exam. So the new material that we've been doing his stuff you really need to get in tune with so again, for those of you are worried about whether you're passing a probably passing come and see me and I'll tell you for sure.  You know a lot of a lot of it in general if it comes down to this thing. Are you doing the homework? Are you doing the labs? Are you turning them and blah blah blah try to do the best you can on me on on exams. You will get better at them. I guarantee that. Okay. I must go back over to this question here on this is the question of the day. We're certain tungsten compound.  It is determined experimentally.  You can read it.  Could do this without you should be able to do this. You should be able to do this without a calculator.  And I do apologize for not being here on on Thursday and Friday, although I'm sure most of you are happy as hell.  The thing is after today's lecture. I expect we are almost completely done with the quote core material in camphor.  Yeah.  Yes, it goes up on that day. By the way. There's a couple of you just remind me is a couple of you that I am going to ask to come and see me, but it'll be next Tuesday and it has to do with the with behavior on exam.  Yes, I always make sure nothing this lab report. However this report.  Will go up until I leave this one up and wanted to do was you supposed to be due on Thursday that when I leave up until Tuesday, but I will light the new one up. The new one is.  busy  Okay, I'm sorry. I'm checking something here.  Thank God you can't see what I'm looking at on my iPad. All right.  All right left last chance U.  Okay, let's end this beast and see what the correct answer is.  Yes indeed. The correct answer is c k again if the tungsten ratio is 3 3 3 3 2 1 4 the island if we divided if we divided .33 we can do this a couple different ways multiply .33 by 3 to get .99. That's one multiply 1 by 2 gives you 3 moles of iodine when you multiply that 1 by 3 that gives u w I3 you could have been immediately and should of immediately got rid of B & D. Okay.  Andy you just picked because you didn't know okay.  There's another trick. I'll tell you this with halogens halogens are fluorine chlorine bromine. Iodine in it. Are you almost never almost never will see only one of those and multiple of whatever the element is in front of its OWI 3 and normals never seen. So whenever you see a compound that has more than one more than one of a given metal in it, like ww3. It's always going to have more halogens than just one. That's just a piece of information to keep in the back of your head for the next time you get some somebody asking you a question like this. Okay. So that was good last escape this bad boy and that  Got a question for my other people and then now you cannot click in.  And yes, some of you will figure this out others of you will be confounded.  All right.  trachea on a tree of equations we have discussed if you remember from before  We had discussed the two methods for doing limiting reagents. We talked about the need versus have have that's where you take one of the starting materials use how much of it you were given to calculate how much of the other starting material you need. Okay.  some people love me versus have  The other method and it's the woman I use because I just find it easier mentally to not make a mistake. I use the multi use all the methods by the way, but I use this one always as a double check if I'm using the need for 7 is the product method is what we're going to do. Now. The product method is one where you say, okay, how much product can I make given this amount of starting material given this amount of starting material how much product can I make taking the second starting material ask yourself? How much product can I make with that? The one that makes the least amount of product is the limiting reagent and remember this the limiting reagent is what all calculations are based on okay?  You can't make two dozen chocolate chip cookies. If you only have enough chocolate chips for one unless you make the worst chocolate chip cookies on Earth, which some of you do.  I am the best cook in this room.  I also a better cook than your mom and your dad he different professional shelf chef.  Challenge me.  I just made I just made.  10 pounds  i've smoked bacon homemade smoked them starting with pork belly during it myself. I can make food. I'm not going to try your food. By the way sometime if you're ever take me in the summer for Kim 6C. I'll tell you the story about the brownies, but you don't go there now.  At any rate that cough of cookie and I like how they got their own product method the park Methodist. Look, this is how much of this starting material I have. This is how much of a starting material have what is the maximum amount of product I can make in the maximum product is limited by whatever you're limiting reagent happens to be which is why they're called limiting reagents. I think as I said, as I said before we went to the need versus have method that's where we ended up last time.  I would recommend when you as you doing limiting reagent problems, and there's lots of practice problems on the on the web page or on our room on a Triton link page.  I would recommend that you try them you tried both methods and then pick the one you like pick the one that works for you every time or works for you or you find most convenient but in the beginning, I would recommend that if you do it by need forces have always check it with product method. If you're doing product method check it with me versus how could you should get exactly the same answer for both of them? And eventually you're going to find one of the two methods that you're going to like better than the other one and and you should be able to flip back and forth. Now, there's a method called the ratio method that I'm not going to tell you about the ratio method is one that I also used once in awhile, but it's tricky because if you make a mistake, you might not know that you made a mistake and fact, you might not know you made a mistake you get your your exam back.  You're so limiting reagent works the product method how much?  Silver phosphate. Can I make with the amount of sodium phosphate I have to start with.  Then you ask yourself how much silver phosphate can I make?  With the amount of silver nitrate, I have the start with no part of the reason this method is successful. By the way, for those of you sitting on the on the the steps. There are seats in in here if you want to find a place to sit down.  What are the reasons this method then I advocate this method is so successful is that a lot of times you are being asked how much a product can you make so you're going to do the calculation of the end. Anyway, why not just make it make it easy and do the calculation to start with So based on the amount of sodium phosphate we had to start and if you remember from before I want you to go back and look at the slides on point 131 moles of sodium phosphate is what we had to start with our story key metric ratio again from are balanced chemical equation are streaky metric ratio.  Ksr.  And again here is the US are down here was one the one which means that that one that point 131 moles of sodium phosphate is going to give us Point 131 moles of silver phosphate based on sodium nitrate. We had .08 700  Of the silver nitrate to start with we now use the store Key metric ratio that we get one mole of silver phosphate for every 3 moles of silver nitrate that gives us .02 900 moles of silver phosphate that can be made. And now what we're going to do is we're going to compare these two numbers. We're going to compare this and this number  The one that makes less product.  Is the limiting reagent?  The one that makes the least the less amount of product is the limiting reagent not the one that makes more.  Hey, the one who makes the least is the limiting reagent. So all calculations from this point forward are based on that limiting reagent no notice I can compare moles.  And that's one of the nice things you don't have to convert this to grams. You can do the calculation at this point in time and compare the moles with one another and that's pretty easy eventually use calculation. Anyway, okay, since you make bless you, since you make less product from the starting amount of silver nitrate there from from sodium phosphate silver nitrate is the limiting reagent is exactly the same result that we found.  When we did the knee versus have method which is exactly what it should have been the both method should give us exactly the same answer not only should they they do so here we can look at this and say okay based on the silver nitrate that we have all of our calculations from this point forward are going to be based on that. And so again, we finish our set of calculations hear the product method giving us that that again I went to the calculation just did I just transferred the calculation over here that we should mate 2.0 290 moles of silver phosphate.  And that amount of silver phosphate when converted to grams for 15.7 grams of silver phosphate 4 mol of silver phosphate means that we're going to make 12.1 grams of this. And again, this is the results are identical for the two methods which they should be. Okay. Now a lot of people are tempted and I'll warn you about this and I warn you why this is such a big deal here in in just a second. A lot of people are tempted.  Bye.  Why do people are tempted by simply looking at these numbers here?  But that number in that number and they say oh, there's less silver nitrate.  And there is sodium phosphate therefore. It must be the limiting reagent.  The only time that works is if the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation are one or if one of the coefficients is one that sometimes work if the coefficients are the starting materials are anything other than one do the calculation because you will find that you will find cases many cases where the one that has the least amount of moles because of the story K metric ratio is not the limiting reagent. But again this case it works because of the fact that we have.  In this case, it works because of the fact that we have the we have a 1in that is the coefficient there.  Okay, let's finish this thing out reagent and excess determination. Okay. So a lot of times calculation Joey is asked to do or you will be asked to do is just alright fine. We know what the limiting reagent is. We know what the reagent in excess is how much of the reagent in excess is left at the end of the reaction and why would be interested in this what was the number of reasons one practical reason is that we want to know how much are the starting material is left over because it will affect how we isolate our product. That's one thing the other reason that we want to know how much of our Creation in excess is left over is that we may want to add more of the limiting reagent to use it up. That's another reason for doing this. Okay, so  How do we do this? Well, this is an example of where we would do the calculation and instead of using the limiting reagent to calculate how much product we're going to make we're going to use the limiting reagent to calculate how much of the other starting material we needed. We were going to use up. Okay. So .08 7 on moles of silver nitrate requires again, there's my story key metric ratio from the balanced chemical equation .02 900 moles of sodium phosphate.  Okay.  Again, I used my story key metric ratio of 1 to 3 there.  That means the amount of sodium phosphate that I had at. The start is 141. We did that calculation. So now how much is left with what's left of the sodium phosphate?  Play what's left of the sodium phosphate is.  the amount  at the start -  The amount used is equal.  to the amount of  access  reagent  that's left. Okay. So if we do that calculation what's left is .102 moles of sodium phosphate. We had 1.31 that we started with we use .02 nine at least as a point 102 convert that to grams. That means we have 16.7 G of the sodium phosphate left, which means we really overloaded that reaction with sodium phosphate.  Okay.  True Religion in excess is another one of those sort of one of those calculations that we want to be able to do a practical a practical thing.  in all of this  a practical thing in  sorry checking something sheer.  a practical thing in all of this  is this idea?  Is this idea of what happens?  What do you really get when the reaction is over with and for most of you this doesn't mean bupkis because you don't really think about this. Okay, you don't think about about the yield because you don't really have to okay, but when you start making chemicals you start making compounds that are worth thousands of dollars a gram.  I was making a compound at one point in time. It was about $55,000 a gram.  Every gram of that.  Is worth $6,000 with a lot of money, but there's another problem here, okay.  How many of you probably everybody because none of you are as good a cook as I am. I want to know if you ever put too much salt into a ditch.  Okay, if you put too much salt in how do you get rid of it?  Put water more stock. You can't do that if it's  Actually, there's another way to do it you put a potato in butt and that sucks up the salt. The bottom line is you can't if you over-salt a dish.  You can't get rid of the salt. Okay, or you can buy washing it off. But what happens when you wash off something you lose part of the food? Okay. So the question comes when you're doing a chemical reaction, what if part of the chemical reaction goes Haywire?  What if when you're doing the chemical reaction you make something you didn't expect? Okay. These are what we call side products side products become a bigger and bigger deal when you get out of the general chemistry sequence. When you start talking about organic chemistry where we have to worry not only about what the major product is, but what the mine or products are the minor products don't mean much until you get in Pharmaceuticals where a small portion of a minor product can completely destroy the biological profile of the compounds. You just made  this idea here a yield the main product inside products, but there's also what we call a mechanical losses mechanical losses are losses from scoring for example  pouring from one vessel into another  adding methanol to your zinc iodide and then filtering that anytime you lose some product from a manipulation you do you is what we call mechanical a mechanical wasp and in the end it leads to less product than you would expect so  Forgot about that.  Okay. Didn't know about that. Sorry I get texts on this thing, which is as bad as when I get phone calls on it and it doesn't have cellular but my phone transfers it to my iPad which in the middle of class if you see me frowning at my iPad at usually why cuz I'm not going to answer the phone in here. I'm at Coolidge, but you don't need to hear some of the stuff. The guy get asked. All right. So how do we evaluate how efficient a reaction is an answer to that is something called percent yield percent yield is nothing more.  Then the percentage.  product you God based on how much you actually got versus how much you theoretically could have gotten and that's what it is percent yield is the actual yield by by the theoretical yield x 100 k  It is an efficiency. It is a measure of the efficiency of a reaction.  To be able to do it. We need to be able to to be able to get  Is me to be able to get the theoretical yield we need the app. I tried to get the percent yield. We need two numbers. We need actual yield. We got in the laboratory actual experimental number and we need to see a radical number which is what we've been calculating all along here. Okay, so in for the example, I just gave if the theoretical yield is 2.1 grams and you actually isolate 9.92 grams your percent yield will be 82% because in this again my percent yield.  It's all right, and we go my percent yield.  Will be equal to hear equal to 9.92 grams and hears. We do make sure that your units are the same on the top is on the bottom / 12.1 grams after theoretical yield. This was for silver phosphate.  * 100 and that will give us  the 82%  Again, this is a number that is more important when you're actually in the laboratory when you're actually doing research.  When you're actually doing some kind of a some kind of work where you want to rate the efficiency of the compound weather. I mean, by the way, you could also use the percent yield for things like for example percent cured if you were looking at it at a diseased state for example the theoretical number.  Which by the way is never usually 100%  but the actual number of people that that show symptom relief divided by the number of people that theoretically should have had symptom relief times a hundred so you can get this percent efficiency in all kinds of other calculations as well.  Again, it is a measure of efficiency that we use solution Stoichiometry is also just part of Stoichiometry, but solution Stoichiometry is the kind of story geometry. You going to spend most of your time outside of Kim for we'll do it in here as well. But outside of Kim for when you get to Kim 6 being sick. See you do nothing but solution Stoichiometry solution Stoichiometry is based on the fact that all chemical reactions almost all of them are done in a solvent medium. Whatever reason a lot of it has to do with contact ability of the reagents to contact one another it has to do with the fact that you can you can accurately measure out the amounts of material that you want the real we want to carry out the reaction on because both reactions are already in solution. We call these solution Stoichiometry problems.  Done exactly is problems. We've done before need versus have limiting reagent product method. What have you the only difference is that to start?  That the start you don't you weren't typically given a gram amount instead you're giving a concentration something like grams per liter moles per liter, which is the most common one that we use the only difference. As I said here is the solution composition must be considered solution composition and volumes used have to be utilized to determine the amounts of starting materials.  What's the amount of been determined you proceed as before and almost all solution problems are limiting reagent problems. That's not 100% true. But it's it's more truth than the not. Okay. So for example if we have a solution.  If we have a solution that is 0.171 molar.  in silver nitrate  and we use  100 racist whole thing here and do it. Right and we use 121 Miller.  of yet what we would have to do is take point 0 1 7 1  moles per liter  of agno3 and multiply that by 0.121 liters  And that would give me in this case.  The moles of agno3 what's nice about this is you don't need to calculate the molar mass of your starting materials. You just you get moles directly. So it makes calculations a little bit easier, but it also means you need to be able to do this kind of a calculation que. No,  so will do Sai solution Stoichiometry calculations here in a minute. But before I go on I want to point something out now, if you do not understand what I'm going to say next just ignore it, okay?  Molarity is what what are the units of molarity?  Okay, if I take morals and x 10 to the -3, okay.  What what would you call this into using the power prefixes?  What's 10 to the -3? What's the power prefix for that?  Millie so this is a millimole.  What if I take leaders and x 10 to the -3?  Milliliters K10 in the volume is 3 / 10 to the -3 is the same as what?  once I took moles per liter and I X 1 I got millimoles per milliliter, which is  more which means you can use milliliter.  In your calculations as long as you realize that you're not calculating moles, you're calculating millimoles now again, if you have no idea what I just said.  Worry about it.  But I want you to think about it. And the reason I want you to think about by the way, you'll never have to do this. You can always. Always able to solve my problems by converting milliliters to liters and molarity that way the reason I bring this up is because when you get into chemistry 6B + 6C knowing this relationship and and when we do the volumetric lab at the very end of the quarter when you do that lap knowing this relationship makes calculations much easier again, if you don't really understand this, that's okay. Think about it. You don't have to use it. But I want you to sort of like I want to sort of push you toward a better way of doing these kinds of things.  Alright, so how do we do solution Stoichiometry calculations? We carry out the first three steps for standard Stoichiometry calculations. We're going to determine the limiting reagent. We're going to calculate the moles of design material based on limiting reagent rent to calculate grams of desired material based on your limiting reagent sounds like exactly what we did before and it is okay. So here for example is one of these so here is this is a question. It's going to mix a solution Stoichiometry with a solid. Okay, and then we're going to ask ourselves what's going on here. Now this so specialized cells in the stomach really KCl to Aid digestion if they release too much the excess can be neutralized with antacids a common antacid contains magnesium hydroxide.  Which reacts with the acid to form water and magnesium chloride as Government testing as a chemist in a Government testing lab you use point one molar HCL to stimulate the acid in the stomach how many liters of stomach acid react with the tablet containing Point 1.1 gram of magnesium hydroxide. Now, this is an example of a reaction. We're going to talk about reaction types in a little bit here. This is an example of a reaction type that is known as an acid.  Bass  reaction  an acid base reaction. We take some acid h a  Again, remember for compounds if I have a compound's chemical formula begins with a with hcn acid a can be anyting k h a aqueous.  Plus in this case m  O h.  M stands for metal o h is the hydroxide base. We'll talk about more General aspects of acid-base chemistry later, but here were talking about acids as being something that provides H+ basis as being something it provides o h - just like you did last Friday. Okay that what happens is you get a combination reaction where the  h  from here and he always from there goes to make that which by the way is water. Okay.  And that's liquid because aqueous water makes no sense.  Tell us in this case.  M A aqueous at least I'm assuming it's another word the metal iron combines with the with the anti in from the acid to make one of the compounds in the other compound. We make any time we react in H+ with an o h - is water. So the first thing we need to do is to write a balanced chemical equation here. Now again going to do balanced chemical equation when to start that up in just a little bit here. So what is the chemical reaction here? Well, I put it on this slide magnesium hydroxide has two hydroxides in it. Oh H's in it. Okay HCL has one H+. Therefore. We need to ATL to react with 1 magnesium hydroxide. Again. The magnesium hydroxide is providing 200 H's.  Bhc. I was providing only one H+ there for this is what this is how we have to do it. So this is our balanced chemical equation magnesium hydroxide is a solid + 2hcl going to magnesium chloride + 2 H2O s  The first thing I have to do here is to calculate how many moles of magnesium hydroxide I have again any time you're given grams. I need to calculate you need to convert that to moles which is so we do that here. We have one mole of magnesium hydroxide and I calculated the the molar mass of it at another location.  For every one mole of magnesium hydroxide, we have 58.33 grams of it. That means that we have 1.7 x 10 to the -3 moles of magnesium hydroxide. Now, we're going to ask ourselves how much HCL am I going to need? Okay. Well in terms of the HCL again the story geometric ratio.  District e metric ratio Here Comes  From that balanced chemical equation for everyone magnesium hydroxide in a two acl's which means I'm going to want to do the math 3.4 * into -3 moles of HCL. And now what I'm going to do is multiply that by a number that takes moles.  And converts it to leaders. Well if my ACL  but if but it was my ATL is  0.1.  Oh moles of HCL  for everyone leader  if I then invert that  so that leaders are on the top and moles around the bottom. That's why I like to take molarity and write it out as moles per liter. So I remember what my units are. It tells me that I'm going to need 3.4 x 10 to the -2 liters, which is about 34. Ml which is 34. Ml.  Just so you know, this is equal to 0 point.  340 * 10 to the -3, which is equal to 34.0.  Is 3/4 by 34.0 34 based on what I did here.  milliliters  And quite often that's how you going to be asking if he has to put it into milliliters rather than leaders because it's more convenient volume to work with on a small scale.  Now this brings up another problem and I'm going to let you guys work on this one over the weekend over the weekend, but I might have to tell you some things about this sort of thing. So.  This is a very common 6B calculation. Sometimes it shows up in 6 a but it is one and I will provide the answer to this when I post the annotated slides tomorrow. Here's what you need to know. So when 350 mL of a 9.090 ml its own I know molar again need to fix this slide eventually.  molar mass of sodium chromate yellow precipitate forms calculate the concentrations of all ions present in solution when the reaction is complete, so  what I'm looking at here is this I'm looking at  PD  no.3  aqueous  PB no.3 2 aqueous Plus  na-2 cro4  aqueous  goes to give  PD  cro4 as a solid  Plus  nano3 aqueous  two of that  And I think I'm okay there. I think I'm balance at this point in time. Okay.  Now here's the thing that you need to know to be able to do this problem. First of all anything. That's a solid.  Is just that it is a solid the irons are glued together and they won't come apart in the water solution. That's number one. Number two is what does aqueous mean? I'm going to go through this in more detail in just a little bit. So what does aqueous mean? Well aqueous means it in water, but it's more specific than just that.  for an ionic compound  nano3 aqueous means  and a + aqueous  + no.3 - aqueous  PD  no.3 2 aqueous  means  TV 2 + aqueous  + 2  no.3 minus aqueous  In other words, the term aqueous means that that compound is soluble in water and if it is ionic.  It means it splits into ions you to do when this problem is calculate.  The concentration of all ions that are present in solution when the reaction is complete. And by the way, this is a limiting reagent problem and a reagent in excess problem.  Okay, so I want you to give this one a try because you will see something like this final exam next exam.  More times and you want to count. All right module 7 that ends this one I do want you to go ahead I do want you to do that. It is important that you go through and do that to other set of calculations.  What I'm going to do now is I'm going to move over to the new to a new module and that module is balancing Chemical Equations or chemical equations and reaction Class K. After this module. By the way, the next one we will do is the heat and energy or I will do I'm classes of reaction and then heat and energy will talk and we're going to try to go back and forth between a number of different things there so chemical equations and reaction classes now,  Up to this point in time. You just been can you just been you just had reactions dumped on you? You really don't know what three actions mean? Okay another words.  UC reaction in your told so it's a precipitation reaction or it's an acid base reaction or to redox reaction. Okay, which I don't think you've seen yet. But we're going to do which would have spent a little time looking at how reactions are classified in chemistry, but we're going to start by looking at what a chemical equation is and what the chemical equation tells us and on the surface. It looks like well, this should be pretty straightforward. There should be any real problems here, but there's a lot of subtlety and what we see in a chemical equation. So to this point what you've learned how to do  Up to this point in time. What you've learned how to do is you've learned how to write chemical formulas of the name compounds chemical formulas and compositions are determined experimentally, I'll start the omelettry works and how to determine the amounts of products and reactants enter to be made or used in a chemical reaction. That's what it is about. Now. What we're going to do is return our attention, even those sounds like a backward way to do it. Now we know how to do those calculations given the balanced chemical equation given the equation and its balance now we're going to look at how we write those equations. We're going to learn how to balance them. When where they come from. Okay, and to do that, we're going to talk about how to balance chemical equations and in the basic classes of reactions to be successful. It's assumed that you can write a chemical or correct chemical formula given a name and or the irons that make it up in other words. You should know.  But if you were given led to plus that led to plus is going to combine with tonight rates again nitrate is -1 letters plus two result to get ionic neutrality. You need to nitrates for everyone lead. This is an important thing to be able to do to make sure that you know how to do  chemical formula  is  something that in symbol for meaning  Meaning given us the elements. It tells us what substance compound we're studying these like the ingredients in a recipe sodium chloride is NaCl silver nitrate agno3 and again they combined in amounts.  The cation With the Enemy trying to achieve ioniq neutrality.  So now where's the total charge of the cation has to equal the total charges of the anion. So if you need to plus ones to balance off a negative to the chemical formula will be cat eye and sub 2 and I in someone can I or anion?  When chemical reactions occur in those materials, we are studying will undergo recombination of the elements that make them up to form new substances made of the elements that we begin with just like a recipe we need combining amounts or combining ratios to be able to know how much of each material is needed. This is what a chemical equation is. What a chemical equation is.  know how the chemicals combine  Is not something that were talking about at this point in time. Okay, so  What does a chemical equation have in it? First of all, the chemical equation has starting materials or eagents. They are both their their terms that are used.  Four digit general terms. Sometimes we called in the reactants. So for example what you have.  Is you would have for example?  starting material 1 + starting material 2 +... Or you would have  reactant 1 plus reactant 2 +... These are the compounds that make up.  What you're starting with now before I go on I need to remind you of something.  When you are given a chemical equation you are to read the chemical equation and interpret the chemical equation from left to right.  You are to interpret the chemical equation from left to right.  Okay, so think of this.  If I read that from left to right, what do I got?  Okay from left to right? I got what if I read it from right to left.  two different things  Yes, they are. Okay, bottom line is a chemical equation red and One Direction.  Is Witten in that way cuz that's what we want you to look at. If you read it in the other direction parameters change not something you need to know a reaction. We'll proceed K again a reaction that will proceed.  if a tabby  proceeds  BTA  will not.  That's important remember in the next experiment?  When you're given a chemical reaction and you study that chemical reaction you come up with parameters for that chemical reaction. Will the reaction proceed in the direction written?  if it will  That means it will not proceed in the opposite direction if the reaction will not proceed.  In the direction written it means it will proceed in the opposite direction. So for example  in a real in a real-world if I take sodium plus one aqueous.  Plus magnesium metal as a solid.  Go to magnesium 2 + aqueous.  + sodium is a song. By the way this equation is not balanced as this is written this will not  proceed there for  Okay.  magnesium 2 + aqueous  Plus sodium as a solid going to sodium plus one aqueous.  plus magnesium  solid  will  proceed  So again if we know what happens in One Direction.  We automatically know what happens in the opposite direction.  k  you know what happens in One Direction you automatically know what happens in the opposite direction. The products are the materials that are made. These are the starting material sodium in magnesium or magnesium chloride and sodium there the products  our what is made.  So product one.  + Product 2 + whatever  The coefficients are the numbers in front.  Of each of the starting materials or the products. So for example  X  I'm starting material 1 + y of starting material to  goes to  Z  a product 1 + w  a product to  Dakota fishing spots  Are telling us how much how many of each of the individual compounds are needed to react for this reaction to occur stoichiometrically glee means?  You have exactly enough of starting material one to react with all of starting material to you have.  The coefficients are whole numbers when we balance a chemical equation.  Funny balance a chemical equation. We only change coefficients. We never change subscripts.  When you balance chemical equations, you always change coefficients never subscripts somebody in this class.  well if they all came for  because I will make sure you fail camphor.  If you write.  na2cl 2  in trying to balance a chemical equation  Okay, what is that compound that compound is failure?  Okay, that's a very interesting name. Okay.  What's the name of that compound?  That's banana.  All right.  Yeah million.  Am I a Jeep guess? Okay.  alright states of phases  States or phases are something that we put behind.  States or phases are something that we put  behind the actual behind the actual compounds  that we have. Okay. So for example  Okay. Sorry. I just keep checking something. You don't need to know what?  Okay, so  What are the states are faced the states are phases tell us about how that compound exist in the reaction. We're studying and the states are phages are typically put in parentheses in the states or phases that we have are typically s in parentheses for solid.  elf liquid  by the way liquid  does not mean in water liquid means that it's a liquid material is dissolved in water will talk about those.  G  means gas and a q means aqueous.  Aqueous like I had said earlier means that compound dissolves in water and is Ian water and if it is ionic.  It's splits in the irons. It dissociates into ions. Okay. So for example  pbcl2 as a solid means that compound is a solid if it's in an aqueous solution if it's in water, it means it is a solid that is not soluble in water.  20 chemical equation when something is given the S4 solid if you're in water, it's telling us that that compound does not break up into ions in water. It stays as a solid.  Arrow is something that dissolves in water is a liquid that dissolves in water but doesn't break up into ions. For example.  See 2860 which is ethyl alcohol when you put that into water.  We give it the phase designation as L4 liquid meaning it is a liquid that dissolves in water but does not irons.  I guess in water.  like for example  CO2 as a gas, that means that this is a gas that is dissolved in water if we're talking about an aqueous reaction.  So S G & L  are telling us that these compounds are just asked in an in an aqueous reaction a water reaction that these compounds dissolve in the water.  But that these compounds don't dissociate into ions in the water.  Italo's are something else there were two arrows that we run across in chemistry and you three arrows and actually more than that, but one arrow is this one this is the arrow you're going to be see the most this arrow is red is red as gives.  yields  goes to  it indicates that the reaction goes only in One Direction.  but almost all chemical reactions  have the ability to go in both directions for that. We are going to see a second Arrow second set of arrows and that second set of arrows looks like this this set of arrows is written as in  equilibrium with  What's a topic for chem 6B I will mention it very quickly at this point to say that the equilibrium arrows mean the reaction can go both in the forward Direction in a reverse Direction. But having said that as far as you are concerned for camphor  the arrow on the left and the arrow on the right.  The goes to arrow and equilibrium Arrow are to be treated as if they were the same thing.  okay, at this point in time you're going to treat those as if they are the same thing, even if  I use one versus the other these reactions up here are typically not equilibrium reaction. That's why you don't see me use the equilibrium Arrow here, but that doesn't mean that I could be some reasons for that the one animal that you're never going to use at least here is this this is what's called.  resonance Arrow  k  resonance Arrow  Is used only when we start drawing structures, it is never used in a chemical equation and don't use it in a chemical equation will take points off and later on professors are really going to be picky about this.  The residents Arrow you have not we haven't used it yet. The residence arrow means two structures that can be interconverted by moving electrons this point in time. You don't know anything about it. Don't use it. You was only the two arrows that are shown there.  now having said this  what does the phase mean in aqueous solution already said they already talked about this.  First you got any component has a q as its phase. The reaction is occurring in water. The first thing you need to know as soon as you see any component with a Q behind it. You're talking about a water solution, which is what we're talking about in the general chemistry sequence in chem for 99% of the time.  Hu means in water and literally dissolve and soluble in water when you see a queue behind something it means that compound is soluble in water.  S means solid Aldean's liquid Genies gas. And remember. This is what I was talking about before a solid means the compound if it's in water is in soluble. It means it doesn't break up in the irons liquid means is dissolved in water is a liquid that's dissolved in water, but doesn't form ions and g means it's a gas that's dissolved in water, but doesn't for Minds when it's dissolved k,  Liquid is one you very rarely see.  gas is one you will see more commonly than liquid but most of what you're going to see you're going to be a q and s  What does the AQ designate this will be the last slide that I want to go through here today? What is the AQ designate for type one and type two compounds what it designates is.  the compound  at the compound  Is soluble in water?  and  dissociates  Into ions. So for example, PB no.3 2 aqueous.  means  pb2 + aqueous  + no.3 -  aqueous + no.3 - aqueous  Sky show you all the ins here, okay.  For type one and type two compounds when you see a queue behind it, you know, and it's soluble in water be it dissociates into ions or type 3 compounds like for example glucose. It means they are soluble in water.  But you not.  dissociate  into ions. So for example of C6 h-12 o-6  aqueous  men's  C6 h-12 o-6 is  dissolved in water. That's all it means.  strong acids and weak acids will talk about the what they are a little bit later, but for strong acids it means  It is dissolved.  in water  and  dissociates  into ions. So for example HCL aqueous HCL is a strong acid.  means  H + aqueous to put that in quotes you'll understand. Why later.  plus co- aqueous  Where things change are for weak acids, you're going to learn a list of strong acids are going to memorize it's very small.  Any other acid any acid that's on that list is a weak acid for weak acids, which we call molecular acid aqueous has the same meaning as if it's a type 3 compound for weak acids such as hc2 H3 O2 which is acetic acid.  Okay.  means  it is dissolved.  in water  but not  Dissociated okay, that's enough for today. Remember? No class Thursday. No class. Friday labs are due next Tuesday. "
