  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started. So as much as the sound feels like it's week 3, it's only week 2 which is good in a lot of ways make sure that you click in again. The iclicker is on all. I'm starting Thursday will probably do our first performance question, which will probably show up even though I'll turn the iclicker on in the beginning of a class later on what I'll do is restart it or stop it and then started with a question that you'll answer. This will be the first of those performance questions again, you should have read the syllabus. You should read the syllabus to see what those are but you'll but they're basically be question that you have to answer again you need to click in so I'll make him 40 students haven't learned that yet and they're freaking sophomores. So let's go over to the VGA laptop VGA.  And which is my iPad just so you know.  and  chips and see what we can  see what we can see. So first thing is the leaf the lab safety quiz final comments on that. This is over with you're done with that which is good in more ways than you know,  Sorry, I'm trying to do something here and can't find my mouse. There it is.  Can we go that work?  I'm so finally the first thing.  I know most of you had heard me say before about how people have done on it in the past and I can tell you that in in the last 5 years at least the highest pass percentage ever had one person that didn't pass it and they and that was only by one point and it was just simply a mistake that happen. So that's very good. Actually that's incredibly good and I know what that means basically is it you're paying attention. Yes, there were some slugs that I had to reset their there. They're not even that many that happens. All right that happens. That's what everybody get the bonus points or not is a matter of how many points you scored on it. But for the most part I am very happy with that then pack. I'm really happy with the safety is a real big issue and I used to have I used to have a running running dual with the 7 hour, but I used to say my students could always do better.  Safety quiz their students and then for a while I was getting punked because students weren't paying attention weren't doing it. Where do we have a constant? You guys actually put me back in the leave now. So that's good. Safety. I'm a lot of you I went through on Monday 4 on Friday for the morning class or a lot of people that I was pointing outward didn't that some people wearing or wearing dresses that didn't cover their ankles a lot of ankles. I saw people have their jeans rolled up I'ma show all kinds of violation. Most of which I pointed out told people you need to get a sweatshirt into sweatpants the next time I do it and you don't know when it's going to be could be next week. It could be this week. It could be next week could be the week following but if I go through in the beginning of a while, but I will  I'm going to make every I'm going to look to see if anybody if I see ankles. I see skin on the ankles if I see any shoe I think is not appropriate. If I see any dress violation no lab coat, you will be thrown out of the lab and you will get a zero for that experiment. You will not be allowed to come to the afternoon level Beyond droppable or the morning or whatever. The bottom line is the safety dress. That's what that last thing is is a big deal. It's a big deal and if you want it, I don't know about you know, I don't know about you. My professor told me this kind of stuff in class in school. The last thing I want to do is challenge the professor because I remember your name.  I remember your face. I can look you up. I know where you live. Okay, so the bottom line is just follow the safety violation and our safety rules. Some people will say well I'm safe. I'm following safety rules. I'm not going to have to worry about I don't have to worry. You know what it's really the person.  Who is following all the safety rules?  Who causes a safety violation there? Usually the one that gets hurt because the moron next to them isn't.  You rarely it's like it's like a drunk driver.  How many times you ever hear of their drunk driver dying?  But they always kill the person whose car they hit.  K in safety at the same issue. It's the person around people around you the safety protects. That's why you guys have to be on each other's back about safety.  Most of you don't think about this very much and the fact I know you don't you go into the kitchen if you can cook and you don't really think about how dangerous some of the things you work with are a knife for example, okay.  Trash day. I have an I have a tool in my kitchen caught a mandolin or if you know what that is, but think of a slicer on steroids that doesn't tell the difference between a potato on your finger. Okay. I have sliced pieces slices of my finger off on that because I got careless and didn't use the guard because I was I was because I was like what I could do this. I've never been hurt before. Yeah, and I did in the laboratory. That's the first thing they teach you when you're in a research lab.  If the day you become complacent the day you think that you were not.  Going to get hurt is the day you get hurt.  And it's also the day you stopped watching the person next to you is the day you get hurt you wear safety glasses or goggles in the lab as much because you could Splash something on yourself.  But more because of the person next to you can Splash something on you and granted we don't work with really dangerous things in this lab we do in two weeks we will but the bottom line is one slip-up.  Can be the end of your eyesight the end of a finger, you don't grow fingers Back Eyes once they're gone. They're gone.  Kayla Williams  microbac fingernail Maybe  But fingers arms Eyes Nose teeth all that stuff doesn't doesn't grow back you about it. So please just got to be careful. But again, what I do want to say is that you did a great job on a safety quiz, please now, make sure that you want them. I'll fall at T. Azar under orders to throw you out of the lab if you violate safety and that's just the bottom line. I'm there are no makeup labs in camphor and some people think that's just simply because I'm a hard-ass and yeah, that's probably part of it. But the main reason is this we only have those labs.  On Fridays from 9 a.m. Until 11:50 and then from 1 until 3:50. That's all they give us for those lab so they can't have make up some like some other labs where the labs are going all week. This is not the case in Kim for we are sort of a sort of stuck like that. That's why the labs that are designed are designed to be done in one lap. And they're designed to be done in such a way that you can get done early and you should be getting done with early with every experiment.  The only two experiments that usually take longer than they should are the one we do next week not this week. But the one we do next week and another lab call the ionic reactions lab and that's just long because there's a lot of things going on in it, but the rest of the labs are all pretty especially if you do a procedure outline and I and I make sure you read about what a procedure outline is. They're not due yet. First one will be do not this Friday, but the following Friday and that one's not graded. That's one just for the TA is to look over to make sure you know, what you do if you're prepared coming in the lab. You should be out of that lab quickly. I mean within an hour and a half two hours if you need extra time for whatever reason I got extra time, but if you need more than that,  That's usually not a problem. But what is a problem is you can't be in there but Yeah Yeahs will kick you out. If you're there close to the end at which time labs supposed to shut up. If you didn't know that or shut down the people from the stockroom will come and tell us the Wii because they have to get the rat Labs ready for the next group that's coming in in camphor. Sometimes it's the afternoon group studying in the afternoon group that's coming get ready for Monday slap. So they are going to be forcing you to get out of there. So the bottom line is just get done as quickly as you can on the math package experiment experiment 0 is due Friday in the lab at the very beginning of the lab. You will make sure it's stapled all lab reports everything to turn in the last more than one page has to be stapled. If it's not we'll take off three paid 3 points per page that's not stapled and if it becomes a problem and by the way stapling  Doesn't mean folding it over dog earring it. Okay staple is a little metal thing. Okay, make sure that you use them bottom line. Is that there if if they get separated it's not a problem. It's yours because if you're allowed to get separated questions get separated. You're the one who's going to suffer from that.  What you'll do is when you come in on Friday, you will hand the math package. You will hand your post lab questions and Yura pre-lab questions to your TA in separate piles. Obviously the TA will take care of them from there. By the way, if there's anyone in here that didn't take the safety exam.  It is better see me soon. You better see me today because if you come into the lab on Friday and you didn't take the safety exam and I know who's enrolled in the class and I'm going to run the run the numbers again. I will just asked if he has to ask you to leave and I'll drop you from Kim for I might drop you from Kim for if I don't drop you from Kim for you just get an app. But again, I don't have to drive. I have to keep you in the class. If you didn't take the safety quiz and you do need to do and I don't think there's any of those people in here, but please sometimes we get people at adding this week. I hope not but sometimes we do if you know of anybody that has or if you're a new ad and you didn't take the safety quiz, please see me in my office experiment one report is due Thursday by noon at the turn in station. Now, I will tell you this I do not put out.  The turn in all the buckets and I'll show you in this is a bucket. Okay plastic box. This one says Jackson on it cuz that's the one that you're going to pay for a Jackson's lab. That's where you going to put it going to show this on the on the on the big screen here and then it I don't put these out until Thursday morning about the day. They're due the day you turn stuff into it until about Thursday morning about 7 a.m. A little bit before 7 a.m. Directly above us on the 4th floor right front of men's bathroom. You will see a sign that says not yet, but you will see it Kym for turn in station and you will see  these  and receive this thing you will see these.  plastic buckets that have  Quite that Big Lots as far as I can go. There will have on them your ta is named. Okay, and the room just in case you don't know what your ETA is name is what you should and you better know what room is. So the bottom line is you just put your stuff in here and it doesn't matter whether you're a.m. Or p.m. They all go in the same bucket. So for example, if you're in Jackson's morning lab, you put it in here if you're in this afternoon lab, you put it in here. We don't segregate between a between a.m. And p.m. But we do segregate based on who your ta is and that's good because of how things get graded. Okay. Now having said that remember these will be out and I'll be out starting Saturday or starting. I'm sorry Thursday morning the day you turn them in they'll be out there until noon.  If you missed the turn and you will get a zero on that lab, maybe you might get some point points off for being late if I'm in a good mood that day. Yeah.  Which one?  Only the answer she okay. That's a good question. Let me get I mean, let me answer her question there. Let me answer that question for you. I'm almost this by the way is the last of the I take too much time at answering questions.  What is do for the math package for the math package? The only thing that's do is that is is those I think it's 3 answer Pages. It says turn these in on it. The rest of it is for you to do your work and have a record of what you've done for the problems that you don't have this. For example the answers. You don't have to turn in OK and the ones you turn into the old ones were going to grade but those questions on that math packets are things at 10 to show up on exams. Okay, but there's another point that I want to make and this has to do with post lab questions. There were two types of questions that you're going to run into on Labs. There are what are called follow-up questions.  Tell me what questions are part of the experiment there at the very end of the experiment those get turned in with the experiment.  Does get turning with the experiment K II is these questions are these questions that are called post?  Lab questions and the post lab questions always say post lab questions at the top of the sheet. Usually it's one or it's one page almost always front and back the pope bless you the post lab questions get turned into your ta if you turn the post lab questions in with your experiment. You will get a zero for the Post lamp.  .  They are graded by two different groups the TA Tsar grading question pre lab and post lab questions. The lab reports are being greeted by other people at least they will there there we expect them to it'll always be graded by the same person. If you're in Jackson's lab the same person's going to great all of Jackson lab reports, but the questions themselves are being raised by TI. That's why it's important that you make sure things get turned into the right places, okay.  And so anytime you just think about it. There's a there's there's a there's a page. It'll say post lab questions on it. They're those as it's a it's a separate sheet. It asks for your name and all that kind of stuff those you turn into your ta make sure that you've done you do that. Ok. It's really important that you get that done on probably tomorrow or maybe tomorrow. I will post a y the way the new experiment is up on the web page. Both of you should have seen that already. I will make sure you watch the pre lab video. I will probably tomorrow or later tonight put up something on Ted that says this is what to do on this is what to do when where it's due and that'll be one of the last times I do that I'll always mention it but but after a while I get tired of putting it up on Ted because by that time I expect you know what you're doing.  before I go on  one more thing to say before I go on in that is please don't send attachments on your emails jpegs screenshots. Most of you have figured out by now. I just simply delete your email. I won't answer it again part of that has to do with the fact that I think it's rude and the other part of it has to do with the fact that I have been virused by people because of that. Okay, and I have been some really good ones. I don't mean good in the sense that I mean hard ones.  2y get to get through mean if you don't know about that cuz I don't know if you've heard about this Chinese firmware hack on computers, but you really got to be careful about what you download whether it's from an email or from one of your sights, whatever there's some pretty and if someone gets in your firmware, they that's bad. And if you don't know what I'm talking about just don't download anything. Okay be on the Internet is used to be pretty easy pretty didn't have to know much but  you got to be much more careful nowadays, so  Alright, here's a question that I'm going to answer not completely but I'm glad something that goes along with what one of the questions on the home on the sorry on the post spot questions or either post lab questions or follow-up questions for this week's experiment and it's based on something called and we'll talk about this again. You'll see me talk about this again a little bit something is weighted average.  Weighted average applies to mixtures, okay.  What a weighted average says is that some quantity or quality of a mixture?  Is going to be a function of how much of each component.  All that mixture is present. Okay. So what this says is that if I have a component that is made up of let's say  X percent of a  a y percent  Abby  and Z percent of seeing people with more in this. Okay. Let's say we have a mixture that's made up of various percentages of this. Okay, and we want to find out for example, what's the average quantity is for it. Say for example, he wanted to say one find out what the average mass is, okay.  The average mass for example is going to be equal.  chewy  the average based on the percentages of each of those components that are in this so for this what we say is the average mass is equal to something called the fractional abundance of a  times the mass of a and I'll talk about what the fractional abundances in a minute Plus.  The fractional abundance of B.  * the mass of beetle, by the way, this works for this this will work for nachos Masa to work for volume. It'll work for densities. It'll work for almost anything as long as some some Quantic some condition is Method. I'll talk about in just a minute Plus.  the fractional abundance of sea  * the mass of C in K. So what is the fractional abundance F A is equal?  to the fractional abundance  CA which is equal to the percent.  Of whatever.  / 100 so any example up here?  the average mass  of this mixture would be equal to  X percent divided by 100  times the mass today  plus y percent divided by 100.  Times the mass of B.  Plus 0%  divided by 100  times the mass of C.  That's what a weighted averages okay weighted average and weighted averages work for almost everything but there are there is one caveat in this.  And that is a weighted-average works.  as long as the mixture  as long as whatever quantity that we're looking for.  Doesn't vary in the mixture vs. Pure now. What does that mean? Okay. Well, it's easier to explain in terms of of liquids, but I can explain it also using something that you might be able to relate to so, let's say you go to a normal party.  Where you know some of the people at the party, you don't know other people at the party, but the people that you don't know what the party.  Are not people that you hate or dislike in a case like that. The distribution of people in the party room is going to be about the same throughout the whole night. Okay.  Now if you go to a party where everybody in the party is your BFF and they are you are Ben. They're your BFF when you're there BFF K you tend to aggregate together more because you all want to be around each other going to talk to each other. You don't spread out the out the room.  If you go to a party where everyone at the party you hate.  You are going to spread out in that room as far as you can to be away from each other. Okay?  Now let's carry this over to chemistry carried over to liquids. This is where it really shows up.  when you take a mixture of two liquids  do solids as well two gases gases are perfect as far as this goes but in terms of in terms of liquids  There's something called intermolecular forces something to talk about income 6p and intermolecular forces are the forces that pull things together cause them to attract or repel in most cases in most cases. The mixtures intermolecular forces are almost identical to the intermolecular forces of  Pure a pure be pure Z as a result when you make a mixture when you for example take 10 mL of a mixed with 10 mL of b u get 20 of the mixture. Okay. That's all I know you guys believe that and that's true. Okay.  But there are cases not so much worried expanse but we're contracts. For example, there are liquids that when you mix 10, mL a with 10 mL of be the final milliliters you get is not 20  But 19 milliliters, can you get less milliliters less volume than the two you added and that's because when the two compounds come in contact with one another they tend Aggregate and an aggregation they cause the volume to shrink.  So as long as the quantity.  that you are taking the weighted average of of  behaves almost the same in the mixture as the pure components work. Do this will always work.  If however.  The mixture is such that the two components like each other and their volume shrinks when you put them together, it won't work. And that's one of the things I'm asking you to figure out in this experiment. Can we use the weighted average of the density?  Okay, stop the density. For example, if the material is 20% ethanol how much water is in there?  80 somebody actually asked me that question.  Okay, you only got two things in their alcohol and water. So if you know what one of them is and you do because that's what that chart that you that sat chart you look at if you know how much one of them of one of them is. You know what the other one is. So the question I'm asking you is based on your experimental data.  Is what you're finding it doesn't weighted-average work and the answer is going to be it depends on your unknown.  And that's what you're supposed to be answering me. Okay, the beautiful thing about weighted average is that it works for almost everything in chemistry in science. There are some things that doesn't work for and we'll run across though. You run across those boring Kim 6B then you will in here. Thankfully, I'm alright.  So now that we've done that let's go back and finish.  module 2 this dimensional analysis thing that we were doing is multi-step problem and  Then we're going to get into some chemistry here. So this is the this was the problem. I had put up at the very end of last time and this is a typical kind of problem that you might see on a test but it's more like a homework problem on an exam. I'm more likely to break this problem up into pieces rather than to do it this way. By the way for those are you sitting on the stairs? There are seats if you want to sit down you just have to come down the front or close to the front. I mean, I know maybe you like sitting on the on the on the steps, but I never did.  How to put on the steps for one reason in a class K and you don't know what that was.  It's what I wanted to make an escape as soon as I could. How many classes did I try to escape from?  almost none, even my crappy classes even my  economics of different systems  summer classes were just  Anyway, it's another story. Most of the time antropologie was funny. That guy was a nut. But anyway, I was the bottom line is I is we do have seats in here. So please if you please see if you can I'll be don't have to but you know, this is a typical problem what you have to do in a problem. Like this is break it down into the components that make it up and then try to figure this out. This is one of the things I recommend for all students when you're doing problems. And what I recommend is this when you have a problem that's this complicated looks this complicated.  Try writing the problem.  As a series of statements or of what do I need to know kind of statements another words, don't try to do the problem directly out of here ask yourself. What kinds of things do you need to know? So for this problem and there's almost always more than one way to approach a problem not always but almost in this case one solution path would be to determine the time and hours spent driving determine the miles driven determine kilometers driven. That's a conversion there and then finally determined the money spent now there might be other conversions that are required in this just basically because you don't you're not sure so let's take a look at how we do this. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to convert minutes to hours in the reason we're going to convert minutes to hours has to do with the fact that we've been told.  How many minutes we drive we've been driving and we've been told about our speed our speed is in hours.  And the time we've been drip we've driven is in minutes. So whether you make and by the way down on the bottom, I gave some conversion factors that we that we're going to need for this Express this analysis to the first thing I want to do is convert minutes to hours. Now. I could have converted miles per hour to miles per minute.  But I chose not to in this case again. There are more than one way to approach the problem and generally speaking. The only difference is going to come in small errors due to how you converted things. So 250 minutes. There's one for every 1 hour there 60 Minutes minutes cancels minutes that gives me 4.17 hours. I left this thing at three significant figures don't I'm doing this problem on my own at home. I leave as many sig V. I like I leave as many digits as I feel like leaving in it and they only around when I need you I did this as I went along simply because that's how I did it this time. Okay determined by the way, it's three significant figures. It's based on 250. Then it's not the conversion factor, which is an exact quantity.  I didn't determine the miles driven K. I have 4.17 hours * 68 miles for every 1 hour. That's the speed 68 miles an hour. I get 284 and again, I would keep it at 284.  The further calculation but if I was going to report it because I'm only allowed two significant figures because 68 miles per hour is a measured quantity.  It's going to be too it's going to be 280. Now. Some people are uncomfortable like this. If this were the case, you could always have simply put this into scientific notation and simply say that what you have is 2.8.  x 10 to the chew  Miles, in fact if you're more comfortable moving into scientific notation and you should get used to doing that by all means you should do that. So we're going to use 284 my index calculation because this is an intermediate step in the overall solution. I didn't ask you to report. How many miles did you driven out? I asked you to report how many miles were driven you'd have to put down that number in the correct sig figs or for future calculations. You would use the more exact number that you would calculate it, even though it has more sig figs in you then you're allowed to use are they allowed to have at the end? I would then convert miles to kilometers.  So here 284 miles times every for every 5280 ft. There's one mile that is an exact number at least as far as we're concerned cuz it's conversion factor from English to English.  12 in reverie one foot that's another exact conversion in English in English units and then finally won in Forever by 4cm for everyone in again another exact conversion. So all along what we've been doing is we've going miles to Miles feet cancel feet inches cancel inches centimeters for every 100 cm we have one final e for everyone there's a thousand years a thousand that leaves me with kilometers as my units by now put in all the numbers all the conversions.  All the numbers 284-5280 / / 112 by 12.5 4501 etcetera etcetera when I get is 457 km, which is again to significant figures and I'm only allowed two sig figs because the number that I used coming into this the miles was only allowed two sig figs, even though I use 3 in the calculation here.  So now I know that I've traveled 460 km again.  I'm going to determine the money spent now the money spent here. I've 284 miles. That's how many that's how many miles I went that was from a previous calculation.  One gallon of gas for every 32 miles. Now this quantity I should say. This is really a measured quantity and hear you do have to treat it as a measured quantity two significant figures, but the number coming in was only allowed to have that 284 is really to 82 sig figs, so it's not going to affect our calculation.  3.785 liters for every 1 gallon and $0.82 for every one leader needs again. I would have spent 27.6 to $27.62 or $28 to two significant figures now, excuse me. Now again, this is one of these things you have to be careful of.  This answer can have no more than two significant figures no matter what.  Hello what it can have no more than two sig figs. Why is that the answer is it comes down to currency in this case the currency?  Is only in two significant figures we don't have half pennies. Okay. Here. We don't so the bottom line is we have to do this kind of we have to where we're going to have to have two sig figs. No matter what again that's not an issue because the number coming in was really 280 again. We used to 84 cuz we're using the more accurate number to do the calculations.  By the way, for those of you don't think that all of this is that you know, okay. I really don't care. What have you? Okay when you go to the gas station?  How much is a gallon of gas?  Okay, let's put it like this.  When you go to the gas station gas station says the price of a gallon of gas is $3 and 51.  Cents per gallon but is that what it really says?  What does it really say?  No point nine cents. It says it's 349 Thor and it's it's 300. It's $3.50 and then .9 is usually what they use now, that's not my intent to the gallon. It says it's it's a third significant figure on that. Okay. Now why is that? Why is that a big deal? Because the government never rounds down?  K they never round down they always round up.  So let's say let's ask this question.  You think a tenth of a penny if you ever seen office space, you know what I'm going with this if you think a tenth of a penny is not a big deal.  What's a tenth of a penny times a million?  And how much is a lot * 365 a real life. Okay. So the rounding is kind of a  It's something it's it's at the store to like when something's under $4.99, even though you know, it's going to be more now with tax. Sorry getting on my government things now. All right.  Summary unit are as important as numerical values that's really a key to take home with all of this equivalent ratios allows to relate a value in one unit set to another these conversion factors are really important all of science conversion factors Can Have Nots battle operations done on the for example, you can Cube one as long as you queue both the top and the bottom as long as you keep the value along or the the numerical part along with the unit part dimensional analysis has a way of using one or more equivalent ratios to solve problems. I would recommend you get as comfortable with dimensional analysis as you possibly can because I will tell you this you will be able to solve very complicated problems as you go through science without knowing what the actual equation that you need to use is  If you know dimensional analysis or you'll be able to figure out what equation you need to use if you follow the unit always pay attention to your units, they're very important that the units to cancel and then do the actual math always remember to ask yourself at the answer makes sense. Then finally an expert tip. Try working backwards. Once a solution is arrived at this is something almost. None of you will ever do at least not now till now.  I will tell you every a student in the class every a student in my chemistry 6-series class and my chemistry 40 series organic people. Once they get an answer. They always work backwards through it and then work backwards to it for two reasons one is it helps them to pick up any mistakes? They might have made the second is a provides a deeper understanding of what you've done. If you do that again, this is something that many of you aren't used to doing because you probably will never talk this in highschool. I understand that.  I understand that. No, I really don't but the bottom line is this is something you wanted to develop the habit of doing. Okay. It's like walking out of a store and counting your change.  And making sure that they didn't overcharge you or under charge you overcharge you, okay?  Okay. So how many. Having said that let's move on now, so this is going to be end ended lecture to ended lecture for  And let's move forward to talk about atoms in the periodic table. Now it got about chemistry instead of math. Okay.  No on a lot of slides in a lot of these modules at the very beginning of the module there. Will there will not always but often be a disclaimer page a comments page and that comment page is always one that says hey look there's some things that are in your book that we're not going to discuss until later on if we discuss them at all and this is where we're going to start with this one. So although electron configurations atomic theory a Lewis structure and bonding a three-dimensional shape are going to be in the text there going to be mentioned in this module.  I know you mentioned in this module. We won't talk about them in any detail until much later in the course. You're not going to be responsible for these topics until they are covered in detail in the lecture. So for example, I'll talk about what an electron configuration is and I might ask you what an exam what an electron configuration in general is but I won't ask you for example for the electron configuration of iron of sodium Ian until we discuss exactly what it is later on in the course when you study these chapters in the book and when you're looking at stop at the mastering chemistry homework every once in awhile, I want about problem involving this stuff slips into the homework try to do what you've the best you can almost always never never usually hold students responsible for and I try to cut  That stuff out just do the best. You can be the best you can on it. But when studying these Choppers for exams in particular referral lecture slides as your guide and material to know things you absolutely have to know okay, because I'm going to be I'm going to be absolutely clear about what I want you to know and what I expect you to have heard. So we talk about it later on it'll make sense. Now, it is important at this point in time that you if you haven't already learned the names and the symbols for the first 81st 86 elements. Make sure you've done that. Okay, and I will say something say something I didn't point out last time.  You need to know the names in the symbols, not the freaking where they are in the periodic table.  But you don't need to know the names in the symbols for anything outside of the main body. In other words. You don't need to know that row yet. So don't worry about this. Don't worry about cesium price adenium neodymium a promethium samarium europium gadolinium turbo dystopia. I'm home alone, IAM halonium europium. Tmyba Luke worry about those. I guess I'll figure it out what they are. Okay.  of course, you can always be breaking bad because after 1 Breaking Bad, I am c a h o  they just like Breaking Bad was ba.  B r r e l b a r b r b r b a sorry, so you can make your name in Breaking Bad letters if you want.  That's true.  Okay. So having said that.  Let's talk about Dalton's atomic theory. Now. These are the postulates of Dalton's atomic theory in modern terms. How you learn about Dalton's atomic theory again in the 6 series when you get to the quantum it when you get to just before Quantum quantum mechanics are talking about how the model of the atom was developed. Now, you have to understand that this was atomic theory when you read through this list looks to be like, whoa, ho hum. I know this but at the time it was extremely radical not it was it was Radical enough that Dalton.  Was ridiculed for some of it now was Dalton the first one to come up with this. No, actually the first one to come up with all of this with most of the lot of this was Democritus in 300, BC.  And she was essentially Shut Out by all of his peers like Play-Doh like all of these very famous philosophers because he said matter is composed of these little things called atoms little stairs. He called atoms and people said you are nuts.  Everything in the world is composed of either earth water air or he fire, okay.  And as a result, he was ostracized today. It took a long time until the 1600 1800s. I think before this came out the dogs atomic theory don't look at all the work people have been doing all they call the the the alchemy that people have been doing all the science people into doing he said based on this. Here's how I think matter is composed. First of all, I said matter is composed of small individual particles called atoms. You didn't know what an atom was for as far as he was concerned. They were like little steel balls get really no idea what they were but she believed all matter was composed of these individual particles that atoms of a given element are identical in mass and all other respects including chemical behavior of this is one of the places where Dalton went off the rails here.  Don't thought that all that all atoms of a given element like carbon had exactly the same mass at exactly the same properties and that's because he did not know about Isotopes. Okay, talk about that in a little bit.  Isotopes are elements are are are  types of an element are missing forms of an element that have different masses will talk about how that comes up in just a moment. But one thing does that is that is pretty much true. Is that in a mixture in a naturally occurring mixture?  an element like carbon  well behaved identical all the atoms in that sample behaved identical from a chemical standpoint all the elements of barium.  Behaved identical from the chemical standpoint and that the atoms of barium and the atoms of carbon behave differently of different elements differ in mass and chemical behavior. Now, that's an absolute truth.  Two atoms atom of barium an atom of carbon. Absolutely differ in Mass.  Isotopes differ in Mass. But Isotopes have the same number of protons present something we'll talk about in a minute.  Compounds result from the chemical combination of two or more atoms of different elements in a specific ratio. What he was saying here is that when a compound like carbon dioxide is formed carbon. Dioxide is formed when you have  one carbon  and two oxygens  combining  Emmett carbon  Has specific combining ratios with a given element for example, when sodium is combined with chlorine. It makes NaCl when calcium is combined with chlorine. It makes cacl2 one calcium and two chlorines. It doesn't make CaCO3. It doesn't make cacl only makes cacl2 NaCl only makes an ACL not na2cl na2cl to etc. Etc. On this is his slap at the at the Alchemists and daddy is in a chemical reaction. The atoms involved are rearranged separated or we combine to form new substances, but most importantly no atoms are.  Created or destroyed what that means to say is that if you start with carbon atoms on the left hand side of the equation.  You wind up with carbon atoms must have carbon atoms on the right-hand side of the equation. So for example if I take something like CH4.  And I reacted with O2.  That will react to form CO2.  + H2O is unbalanced that we'll talk about balancing later on.  K in other words the carbon which is originally connected to for hydrogen's the oxygen which are connected together. They break their bonds and we combine to make two new compounds but  Oxygen stays oxygen other words oxygen atom stay as often atoms carbon stays as carbon atoms. Hydrogen is hydrogen as they just recombine you don't start with carb my goal that can't happen. Now. We are all you'll learn that there are  There's a sort of a caveat on that we talked about radioactivity, but we'll get to that later on till later on. So what are elements and what are compounds elements and what are compounds?  so  an element the modern definition  the modern definition of an element is a substance that contains only atoms with the same nuclear charge nuclear charge is given a letter capital Z nuclear charge Z is equal to the number of protons. The element has in his the same as it's atomic number. So every nucleus every nucleus.  Is made up of nucleons?  Particles in the nucleus the nucleons are the protons.  Which are the positively charged species. I'm going to call those people plus plus neutrons.  Which I'm going to call an superzero. The neutrons have no charge the protons have a positive charge. So in the periodic table, for example, if we look at carbon carbon is element 6 silicon is element 14 chromium is element 24. That number is the number of protons. It has so carbon, for example  bourbon  carbon-12 carbon and has a mass of 12 units has 6 protons.  Because it must have 6 protons.  Due to its atomic number.  It also has 6 neutrons.  to get 12  So Isotopes are compounds are are are are atoms of an element that have the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons neutrons. Do not change the identity of the element.  Neutrons do not change the identity of the element.  the number of protons does  Order definition of an element was that an element?  A substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances in and retain is chemical identity. This is still true, but it's a more confusing definition. Then the atomic number it was the original definition before we knew about protons neutrons and electrons an element consists of only one type of atom.  And that included that has to do with number of protons it can they can have different numbers of neutrons. That's okay a substance composed of our sorry. It cannot be broken down into any simpler substances by physical or chemical means without losing its identity what this statement means is this once I have a carbon atom.  If I start to pull out protons and neutrons and protons in particular, I completely change its identity.  As soon as I start pulling out the protons and in essence, even though you don't change its identity exactly what you brought Neutron to do something else to it.  Shut the change how it behaves now what are neutrons in the answer to this question is is as simple as I'm going to make it at this point in time. The neutrons act as the glue.  It helped to keep all of the positive.  Charges together in that very confined space of the nucleus.  remember like charges repel  putting a lot of plus charges near one. Another is going to cause them to repeal the neutrons help to keep them all locked up. What is a compound a compound is a substance composed of two or more elements, which are chemically combined like CH4 a carbon attached to for hydrogen CO2 carbon attached to two oxygens. There are two types of Bonnie motifs that we can talk about ionic versus covalent ionic compounds are compounds that are held together by electrostatic.  or by colonic  horses, for example a sodium with a plus one and a chlorine with a -1 the Plus in the mine is charged attracting one another a covalent compounds a little more complicated in a covalent compound we have shared.  electrons forming the bond for example in something like h  CL these electrons are being shared by not only the hydrogen but the chlorine is well a covalent bond is a much more complicated bonding to talk about because of the sharing because not all sharing is equal a molecule is down molecules are compounds. Okay molecules are compounds but technically  A molecule is a structure that consists of two or more atoms that are chemically bound together and behave as an independent unit. It almost always means in this case chemically bound together.  covalently  ionic compounds  the two atoms can be separated from one another in a covalent compound to break that Bond completely changes what the compound is now at this point in time a molecule is a compound by the way.  This specific the way the books like the say this is this but compounds have ionic bonds.  And molecules have all ionic bonds molecules have all covalent bonds. Now, it's not life. Isn't that simple? Okay.  Molecules can have a mixture of covalent and ionic bonds compounds can have a mixture of ionic and covalent bonds.  Don't let it get don't let these two terms confuse you whenever you see the term compound whenever you see the term molecule understand. We're really talking about the same thing.  so this brings us back to this discussion or this this idea of exactly what is a  brings us back to this idea of exactly what is an isotope. What exactly is this thing called and isotope?  4 to 2 before we can talk about exactly what isotope salt. Well, sorry we go down here and say what an isotope is an isotope were atoms of an element with the same number of protons. That's why their atoms of the same element, but differ in the number of neutrons the number of neutrons changes.  Only one thing and that's whether the compound is radioactive or not change the stability of the atom again a much more complicated thing. But for this point in time, we are going to make the assumption.  The only way Isotopes differ from one another is in terms of radioactivity, but chemically they are identical. Which all atoms of carbon regardless of what isotope it is all identical.  And how they behave chemically if there's a difference it'll be in radioactivity and that's a more complicated topic for chem 6C. So for any Cipriani ever any atom or any Brandi Mallory Adam, what we do is we stay we use this what's called Atomic or isotope symbols. And the way it is is it shown on this system here showing right here.  It's showing right here.  Where the capital letter X is the actual element symbol.  There is a subscript to the left of it. That is it's atomic number K. That is that Z. That's the number protons, but it has  The superscript that capital A is What's called the nuclide number. The nuclide number is the number of protons that something has plus the number of neutrons k  and so for example, you see some things on the on the side over here here is  here over here is carbon-12 there to other isotopes of carbon. There is a carbon there is a carbon.  13 and there is a carbon-14. Those are the most common isotopes of carbon now, by the way on all elements in the periodic table have at least two isotopes and many have a lot more than that some have up to 10:11 different isotopes.  How many of them are naturally occurring depends on the number that are radioactive and what have your carbon has three of those? Okay, so in carbon in a sample of carbon  There are three isotopes of carbon here for example is oxygen here is uranium Decay. So in carbon for example, there is  carbon-12  there is carbon 13.  Does carbon-14 decay all of them?  have  6 protons  that's what makes them carbon. Okay, the difference is carbon-12 has 6 neutrons.  Carbon-13 has 7 neutrons and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.  k  Yeah.  You change it to a different element.  Chain remove protons you change the element.  Remove protons you change the element.  Hey now, here's the interesting thing. By the way, these can be written another way. Carbon 12 can be written like this C12 or can be written simply like this carbon-13 to be written like this or  like that  carbon-14 can be written like this or 14a. Why is this the answer is the symbol?  4 Carbon for example that symbol for carbon tells us automatically how many protons are in there if we have a periodic table to look at so sometimes the Z is not shown. It's understood. It's understood because of the element that we have right now in nature.  How much of each of these Isotopes is form?  in nature 98 98%  of all carbon is carbon 12.  1.5% is carbon 13.  0.5% is carbon-14. This is this means that if I have a sample of carbon in my hand 98% of the atoms will be carbon-12 on average 1.5% will be carbon-13 and 5% will be carbon 14.  Now how do we calculate what the average mass of that is will now use the idea of a weighted-average. That's what the app. That's what this is all about. Okay. So again, what we're doing is the average math the average atomic mass.  Is the sum for all of the Isotopes for the fractional abundance of that isotope * the mass of that isotope. So silver for example, which is the atomic number 47. If you look at Silver in this thing silver is composed primarily of two isotopes 107 which has a mass of 106.90. So silver 107  Has an atomic mass of 106.  106.9 there always something like there was like one off 90509.  And we're going to use were going to say this is a I am used for atomic mass units. That's mad that they ain't that's a mass unit. We'll talk about later on. That's a mass unit per atom. Okay, and that the abundance of this is 51.84%  The other silver is silver 109 kind of silver 109.  Which has a mass of 108.904 7-6.  Am you again you need to put the units in and it's a Natural Abundance is 48.  .16% What is the average mass of a silver if I would look it up in the periodic table? Well, it's going to be the average of each of the Isotopes that are in there.  The weighted average of the Isotopes that are in there. So to do this, I'm going to Simply say going to do this. I'm going to say the average mass.  I've naturally occurring silver is equal to the fractional abundance of silver 107k fractional abundance of 107.  times the mass of 107  Plus in this case the fractional abundance of 109  * the mass of silver 109  which year fractional abundance of silver 107 is 51.84. So 51.84 / 100 again, that's how I convert percentages to fractions abundance times in this case 106  106.9 509  Amu  plus the other fractional abundance the fractional abundance of 109, which is 48.16.  48.16% divided by 100 times the mass of silver 109, which is 108.  108.904 7-6  And then if I do the math.  I'm going to get approximately 107 and change. Okay, you can do the math.  Sorry.  do the math  k  now this might be a pain in the neck.  If you had to do it for every element in the periodic table, but it's already been done for you. Okay, so every element in the periodic table has the atomic number the symbol and then underneath it has a mass. So for example in the case of scandium  Okay, Scandium is element 21. That's it's Z.  It has its symbol SC for the Scandium then down below its this one is 48.956. 44.956. 44.956 this number here.  Is the average?  Atomic mass. And it's the average atomic mass. It's already been determined using this weighted average thing. And this is in.  atomic mass units  which is a paper atom.  in grams  from all of that for Marvel to me. Abbreviated this time. So what I'm always later per mole of them or is it is a is a the mall is a quality we use in chemistry because atoms are so small in k  show  Very quickly, let's talk about this and then we'll finish up here we have.  We have to really types of properties have intrinsic properties and extrinsic properties. Okay?  Intrinsic properties are properties of a compound and element a material independent of how much of that material you have.  Intrinsic Properties or intensive properties are properties of a material that are independent of the amount you have density is an intrinsic property.  extensive or extrinsic properties  Are properties of a of a material that do that all function of how much you have for example math is an extrinsic property the mass of iron you have depends on how much iron you have the volume of water you have is a function of how much water you have. Okay. Alright, we'll finish up on this slide. Next time. We'll come back make sure you click in if you didn't remember lab reports are due on Thursday in the turn in buckets. "
