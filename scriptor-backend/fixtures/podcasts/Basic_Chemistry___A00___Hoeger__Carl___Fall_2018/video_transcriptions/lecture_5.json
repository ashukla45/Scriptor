  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started.  As you can see there are people not here cuz they're still finishing up their lab reports which is at the witches, which means that they're probably the C students in the class. So the rest of you broke a lab is tomorrow again be prepared lab coats or must it is the first bout is the first experiment where lab reports are required and they will be required for the rest of the core for any expenses won. The very last thing we do in here which is usually is Lewis structure thing. That's one where they're their puppy lab coats needed but again assume that there's lab coats are needed for every experiment from here forward the math package experiments 0 is due tomorrow in lab at the very beginning of lab and I'm going to say something about turn-ins it just a little bit do not turn that in with your experiment today that all goes to your teeth.  Anything it's not turned into the right place is giving a zero. We don't even think twice about it. And the only person you have to argue with about that is me and the last time I checked.  I don't have to care and I don't OK turn it into the right places at the right times. Okay. I'm the math package all you need to turn in our those few pages that it says turn this in to make sure that you staple it you noticed that one of the pages even though you had to do a bunch of a bunch of different calculations for the math package. There's only a few of the answers are actually turned in and once again, that's just because those are the ones that doesn't mean. Those are the only ones you do all the way. I know some people that some people did that those are just the ones that we grade simply because we just picked some of them we can't bring the whole thing takes a lot longer than I'm grading other than grading other things again, all the experiments the math package. That's so graded by graders. It's not graded by your Tas Tas.  Grade only certain parts of the experiment. They don't break the lab reports. Those just take too much time. Just so you know that so post lab questions for experiment 1 and pre lab for experiment do our due tomorrow in lab at the very beginning of class.  Okay. So where's the math package tomorrow tomorrow to this Friday, you're going to turn in three things at the very beginning when you walk in the door math package post lab questions pre lab questions are going to be three piles eat the TA in the lab left three piles for you. Put it in the correct pile.  If it is not turned in in the beginning of lab, you will receive a zero.  Okay, like for example all I forgot it in my in my dorm zero.  I forgot to turn in when I walk in zero my dog ate my homework 0.  Okay, again, we have too many students and too little time to make exception so we don't. Okay now there's somebody War at EA's was telling me about prelab last week somebody sitting in there doing their pre lab while the th trying to talk that's not happening at EA's have every right on Earth.  To give you a zero.  for anything  K3 home if they don't like the way you  talk to them.  But that's not going to happen. And when you come to me, I'm simply going to say no ta made the decision turn things in when they're do today's experiment are sorry last week's density experiment is due.  This morning by 9 or was I buy noon? Sorry, but my by 9 by 9 everybody be running out of lab and lecture I'll buy noon right above us on the 4th right above your on the 4th floor right in front of the bathrooms. Okay, find your Tia's box. Just put it in there. Make sure that it's stapled now that you got plenty of time. This is the first year, by the way.  You have got you this year. You have 24 hours longer than any other Kim for class I've ever had returned in time. Okay, most of the time turn it on Wednesday, but I changed it to Thursday. There's something else a lot of you figured out and it's something that I do want to make sure that you understand if you realize  first of all a lot of calculations and stuff. I'm not a lot of times. I want you to figure out how to do the calculations.  I can tell you how to do them. Like I told you the weighted-average one, but that's not what I expected. You know how to do most things by expect that I expect you to know how to do I must not going to give you an equation for it because I want you to start developing your critical thinking skills that we do experiments ahead of what we've covered in the class. Sometimes when we do almost always some time before that. I will drop in class especially if there's a complicated calculation or involved or some concept that I know you don't know anything about I'll talk about it. Okay? Why you laugh and that's why you have those videos to watch before you come before you to a lab. So I have to read the lab experiment because I want you to think about what you're doing or not doing anything tomorrow is lab. Okay. I mean if you want to talk about it if you want to talk about how moronic lab.  K12 has lab is what? Okay, not that you're morons. But I've had students Amy stupid Penny experiment. You can look up on Google what the answer is it is but I don't want you to do that. And I know some of you already have I want you to be true. I want you to treat this experiment as it was designed which was an exercise in the experimental method.  Here is a conundrum that I've been.  Ortalama, I've been presented with okay do pennies change weight over time?  Okay, or all penny do old pennies weigh the same I could have asked the same question about dimes nickels hoarders sure done about quarters, cuz then I have a lot of quarters as of right now. I have probably I mean literally in my office I probably have close to  100 lb of pennies  what I'm going to do when I retire I'm eventually going to current turn it into Cash.  Dial Whole Lotta booze. No, I'm just kidding what I told my students Mike M for students in the past and Kim for students always bring pennies and leave them fast them do that. What I'm going to do on retirement is that me to take that money turn it into Cash. I'm going to match it and then I'm going to donate it to breast cancer or where did donate it to one of the K. Look. I know I got a tax write-off. I know I am and what I'm going to do is donate it to there's been a number it's a lot of students have gone back and forth about about that kind of stuff. I want to donate it somewhere where a hundred percent of what I donate goes to the charity and not 80% to some politician that runs that charity, okay.  That's in that's why they went away. If you donate things cheer, you need to really think about that who's running the charity. Where's the money going? And a lot of times a huge chunk of what you donate goes to something. It goes to people not the people who need it. But anyway, that's beside the point. Okay, that's just something I tell you to do. I'm telling you the bottom line is the penny experiment question and it's an exercise in the thought process of how would you approach this and you and and some of you are going to come up with a hypothesis, by the way, if you put the hypothesis is pennies change weight because they change composition. I mean hypothesis should have  Should take nothing into account other than your thought process. Some of you are going to be able to rationalize that pennies should get lighter with age. Some of you were going to be able to rationalize that pennies can get heavier with a some of you are going to be able are going to be able to rationalize either of them pick one. The one you think sounds the most reasonable there really isn't a correct or incorrect answer for that. But what will be corrected incorrect is reasoning.  If you think they get heavier, why do you think they get heavier? If you think they get lighter? Why do you think they get like a reasonable explanation for why you think that happens that is at in and this is the scientific method. You should go into any experiment should go into anything that you do.  Thinking that kind of a thing what that kind of a question. What do I want? And what do I want to learn from this? What do I think is going to happen? And then you do the experiment without prejudice?  Meaning you do the experiment even though you think you know what the outcome is, you do the experiment.  And you look at the results.  As if that experiment has sorry you look at the results without shading them the way you want them to look. Okay, finally one last question about one last thing about the lab.  Is some of you were worried about who you're working with and buy your Lab Partners and stuff. First of all, I told the Tas I don't want friend groups. If they think that the groups are too friendly then they're going to break you up when groups don't work. They're also going to make sure that everyone in the group is working everyone in a group has to contribute if it's a friend group. You can hide it by everybody working together and everybody everybody should have some sort of an equal role in it. When you sit down the three of you were in the group should say, okay.  Welcome to the Real freaking world k m Kim for your Lab Partners really won't drag you down. First of all, the only way your lab partner could really mess things up for you is by you letting them do a part of the experiment where they're making the measurements wrong. Okay now with all of you and the thing is you should all be checking each other.  In the end most of what you get graded for has to do with the interpretation of the data is class is about collecting data the lab part and interpreting it and the interpretation is independent of your Lab Partners, if you've got data and you interpret that data, that's all you can only work with the day you're giving or you have take that data interpreted and come up with an explanation. Does it make sense? If it doesn't make sense put down where errors could have occurred?  I told him an heir by the way, isn't my lab partner is a moron.  And trust me I worked with I work with Lab Partners that we're morons. When I was in graduate When I Was An undergraduate graduate school. You don't have to work with my partner's right? I'll tell you a story later on or about this one guy I worked with and I did one of the dumbest things I've ever seen you did it to himself of course, but he's still this is the kind of guy to work with and I made it work and you can make it work. Don't worry about Lab Partners dragging you down and stop being so damn timid in your lab groups.  Everyone should play a part. Don't be afraid you're meeting new people think of it like that.  Go out for coffee with your Lab Partners or crab or whatever you eat, you know, I am finally last thing dress violations and the address violations. You will be kicked out of the lab.  So do not mess with that.  alright, so let us do the following before we  let's do the following before we go on here.  Going back over to the laptop if I can get this thing to do what I wanted to do here.  Oh, I hate this stupid thing.  this is the this is the  this is the question for the morning.  This is an example of a performance question.  Which of the following is not an egg, which of the following convert which conversion is not exact?  By the way, I will post a note 8 and slides tonight.  That was all the stuff about turning it on time.  Under Armour on the beginning slide my said final turn in notes that was turn things in on time.  You know if there's three separate piles, like I said one for the math experiment one for the pre lab one for the post lab cuz you're old graded separately from one another.  Okay last chance to click in.  Ergo someone to finish their lab  Okay, let's see what you got is an answer.  Correct. Answer is C.  remember remember  If it's metric to metric or English to English those conversions are all considered to be exact as far as we are concerned. The only ones that aren't exact are metric to english or English to metric except for a 2.54 cm is equal to 1 inch. Okay, that's good.  Alright, so let some.  escape this  and now you guys can clicking again if you haven't clicked in a ready and we're good to go. Let's go over to  this in Ponca and start getting back into the lecture part.  By the way today is but that would today is probably the most I'll say about turn ins and stuff from here on out from here on out and it's expected. You understand. So what I did on this slide and I hadn't done this last time because I was going to go to type field in a lot of this again. These slides are going to be available on the web page to come by this evening sometime. So what is an intrinsic or intensive property? These are properties are independent of the amount of material. They are a distinguishing identifier for a given material.  for an alloy for a for a pure compound for a Pure Element  so things that are intensive properties things like density temperature.  Thyroid there are a few others that we will talk about. I'm as we go along their properties are independent of the amount of material have on the other hand and extrinsic or an extension of properties Providence dependent on the amount of material. Sometimes you just called additive properties in other words and additive property is where if you add more of the material or you subtract take some of the material way you change that property. So examples of these are things like Mass heat volume intensive properties intrinsic properties really important because these properties are as unique identifiers can be used as physical properties that we can a tribute to something that don't change.  Depending on the amount we have it's for example, the density of aluminum will always be a certain number regardless of how much you have of it extensive properties again depend on the mount. So what a lot of times we do in science is we want intensive properties. Okay. So one of the ways to make an intensive property  It is to take these two and leverage them against one another for example, what is density?  will density  is equal  to mass divided by volume  in other words density an intensive property.  Is the ratio of 2x density properties and in fact, a lot of intensive properties that will run across in chemistry and science are simply that we take the amount of something.  Or the volume of something. Usually it's the amount and we divide it by another extensive property the amount of space. It takes up something along those kinds of wine to get an intensive property. This is a very common trick that you'll see used a lot. So as a result, you will see typically typically a  intensive property will be made up of two extension properties where we've taken what extensive property and leveraged it against another one physical properties are measurable properties whose value is a property of what you are measuring they're called observables. So for example, if you look at liquid water, if you look at ice, there are a series of observables that you can come from this the melting point the boiling temperature of the melting temperature of the boiling temperature the density.  The amount of heat it can absorb again for physical properties that one of the important things to understand for the physical property is the identity of the material doesn't change if we start with water it stays water if we start with carbon dioxide it stays carbon dioxide a physical property is a property of whatever we're measuring.  As long as that whatever we're measuring.  Isn't changing to something else now different states of matter will have different property. So for example water is a gas water as a liquid water as a solid will have a different set of physical properties, but they are physical properties because it's still H2O. It's still water.  A chemical property is a quantity or property that can only be established by changing a substances chemical identity.  That's a complicated way of saying a chemical property is a property that we establish.  When we take one chemical one element and treated with another chemical or another element and in doing so or under another set of conditions and in doing so caused it to change.  Into another compound. So for example a chemical property.  something like methane  Isn't it undergoes combustion?  Combustion is an example of something called oxidation and the chemical and the chemical equation for that is.  CH4 as a gas + 202 as a gas.  Goes to give CO2 as a gas.  + 2 H2O  as a gas.  So a chemical property of CH4 methane is that it can be reacted with oxygen combusted to give carbon dioxide and water. This is a chemical property of CH4 the chemical property because the material changes from CH4 into another compound that contains carbon carbon dioxide in this case.  Chemical properties are the chemistry of the materials. So when we start looking at all the elements in the periodic table up here.  What we find let me put it this way in the very early days of chemistry people were studying all the different elements that were known at that time.  Compounds they could form etc. Etc. What they say all this something like this, for example, they found that if they treated carbon  with chlorine  they got ccl4 if they treated silicon with chlorine they get sicl4, but they found also if they treated nitrogen.  With Corinne they got ncl3.  So what this told them is that carbon and silicon must have some kind of similarity in their chemical properties nitrogen because when nitrogen reacted with chlorine, it only gave ncl3. It must have a different reactivity a different chemical property when it must possess a different set of chemical properties. So as they examined elements and examine every activities, what they started to realize is it elements could be put into groups in the periodic table where all the elements in a given group.  Essentially the same chemical reactivity the same chemical properties. Okay additive two elements have different chemical properties. They are in different groups. So the periodic tables eventually developed out of this by Mendel Evan. Someone else's name was escapes me. If you were to examine the Galaxy individual you find a basic property such as atomic size something they measured later on. In a periodic fashion Nova words, if you were to look when you want all the senior citizens in on slide later on if you plot for the example atomic size, will you start to see is you start to see a saw a seat a Sawtooth pattern?  By plotting all the elements size versus where the element in the periodic table. And what's your start to realize is that there is some sort of it's not just a random collection. There is some sort of recurring theme so in the periodic table  We can break it down into two things. We can break it down in a watercolor rows and columns rows are what are known as periods. Okay?  periods  are the rows in the periodic table and as you go from. To.  The elements increase in size because they're also increasing in their atomic orbitals in the orbitals. They have K. Don't forget this point in time.  The rows in the periodic table the periods we're going to see certain Trends occur. For example in the periodic table as we go from left to right in the periodic table.  in any given Row in any given.  The size of the elements get smaller as you go from left to right.  K in any given. The elements get smaller in size as you go from left to right? However, as you go down the periodic table from one. To the next one run. Three or sodium is in a down two. For her potassium is the elements increase in size.  Okay. So as you go from one. To the next elements start to get bigger and they get bigger and bigger as you go down the table, okay until we do atomic atomic theory and an orbital has a lot of what I've just a lot of what's going on in a. Is not going to make a lot of sense to you and it should be at this point in time. I would have heard the one that's probably the most important are the columns The Columns are what are called groups or families and this is where the periodic table really sort of stand out. So let's look for example at one of the families here. Let's look for example at the carbon family carbon silicon germanium tin lead.  As it turns out their size as we said before as we go from.. The atoms are getting bigger. But what we find as we go down is that all the elements in that family or have very very similar chemical properties.  All the elements in that family have very very similar properties. Additionally. They also have very similar similar physical properties. That's why they're called families. That's why they're called families.  Interesting Lee the element that has the least in common with the elements below it.  Or in it is the head of the family know the words carbon.  Has significant differences from the other members of the family below it or I should say.  Elite differences  But we put them in that family because so many of their chemical and physical properties of the same, but they all essentially belong to the same family. Yes father's a little nuts. But everybody below it is pretty much on the same page. Okay, there's reasons for this that will get into as we as we go on so we can say here that for  Sorry, what we can do what we can say here is for this we can say that families.  or groups are those that have  similar  chemical  and physical  properties. We really can't say much about but let's take a look at this. This anything that we were talking about. Here is the Sawtooth pattern that I was talking about. If we plot the size of an atom size of an element versus its atomic number Z. The number of protons. It has we see this pattern how you would think that as you increase the number of protons.  You would think that you should see a linear increase in the size of the elements, but you don't know the reason for this that we won't get in to hear what you see is this that in any given. The largest element is the element on the far left and the smallest element in that. Is he element on the far? Right? So this is what you're seeing over here lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium. They are all still increasing in size as you go down four. To.  Okay, but they're also the largest end their particular. Lithium to the next element over which is magwitch is beryllium. We see a decrease in size and then keep going over boron carbon nitrogen oxygen fluorine neon we see  Them's decrease in size not quite as dramatically as the first one but that okay and you can see this Sawtooth pattern. This is what we mean by periodicity. So everything in this First Column with the exception of hydrogen hydrogen is a unique species will talk about as we go through here all of these you can see or the biggest elements of there. And you can see essentially a linear increase sort of linear.  As we go down from. 2. Helium neon argon Krypton Xenon it radon these ones over on the far left. Those are the smallest in that. Now why this happens? There is a good explanation for it would just not ready to learn that explanation yet.  Let's look at the periodic table of the elements and let's classify them according to what they are. And your first classification is that in the periodic table? We can classify something as a metal a nonmetal or a metalloid a metalloid is something that is got some properties of a metal and some properties of a nonmetal K in general what we could find with a metalloid metalloids have chemical properties that are like nonmetals.  The physical properties that are somewhat like metals are in a sort of a gray area. So let's look at what the let's look first at what the metals are. All the metals are easy.  Those are the metals.  Everything that you can't see it as well on the slide everything to the left of this.  Grayish area, let me kind of got germanium in there and didn't really want to and we go like that and we go.  Nothing to the left of that gray Sherry in the ones below are all metals don't have a certain set of properties that we'll talk about in just a moment. Okay?  non metals  Turn on metals metalloids and nonmetals the nonmetals.  And by the way, I know there's somebody over there's somebody out there saying hydrogen is not a metal it is.  It it's it's just so light. It has so few electrons. So few protons that it doesn't behave as a metal unless we put under for a high pressure at very high temperatures.  But it has been demonstrated that given enough pressure. You can turn it into a metal and that's something that's unique to the metal. Now again medals have a certain set of properties will talk about the ones that I just done in kind of a rose-colored. Those are the nonmetals the nonmetals are compounds that have properties that are completely different than those of the that those of the metals and then there are the metalloids.  The metalloids I'm going to color red and blue bow on your slot on the one slide you downloaded you should be able to see it. It's a gray area on the periodic table which separates the medals from the nonmetals.  The metalloids are those elements that have some properties that are like the metals and some that are like the metal the nonmetals fate as I said before they tend to have physical properties that are somewhat like the metals. They tend to have chemical properties that are more like the non-metals.  So before we go any further, let's talk about the states of matter cuz it's the next one. We're going to talk about solids are the most condensed states of others four states of matter solid liquid gas and plasma. We don't talk about Plasma in here. That's for physics. So we're going to talk about these sorry is the most condensed State and I put an asterisk on there because there's one comp  one known compound at least in the universe that I know of that we know of where the solid is not the most condensed State and that is water.  In water. The liquid is the most condensed state by condensed. We mean typically has the highest density is the one where the atoms are the closest to one another.  It is solid you have fixed neighbors things. Don't move around Adams don't move around it typically has a fixed shape and a fixed density. And because it's the most condensed state it has the highest density against the asterisk is water is an exception to this whole thing.  k  water is  a unique compound  whenever you get these science fiction shows with the science fiction movies where they talk about aliens coming to the to the to the Earth to get our water people go water.  The Earth as we know as far as we know now, it's the only planet we know of her one and even this is an XO XO planetary it has liquid water and water is one of the most unique compounds.  No.  If people ask me do I believe in a higher in a higher being?  And I'm not getting going to get religious on you here.  The longtime I used to say all DNA RNA, you know that all that whole genetic thing. It's just so  But then I thought about it longer and longer as I started teaching. I realize the simplest compound water.  If we did not have water we would not be here.  Why does things that you can't imagine?  Saltwater is truly one of these miraculous things. It has the liquid form has a high density. The solid form has a lower density liquid water expands when it freezes, which is why when Lakes freeze when rocks freeze they break up into dirt.  Water has one of the highest heat capacities known which means that it's sticks around and he's a lot more or heat for it to go up into the vapor phase. It's an amazing compounded as we go through as you go through the six series, you're going to hear more and more about water as you go on just how special it is, okay.  Something we really take for granted and I have to tell you I took it for granted for a long time unless I was thirsty.  Liquid is for most things or First Watch the condensed State condensed State basically means atoms are close to one another.  It has mobile neighbors. It moves around. It's a fluid it has variable shape, but it has fixed volume that by definition is what a fluid is liquids are less dense than solids with the exception of water. Okay, and then finally the most comp them the the state of matter that was discovered Last by the way is the gaseous State the gaseous state is the least condensed state. It has no interaction with neighbors now, I put an asterisk on this one. And in fact what I really should do here instead of putting an asterisk on it. I should change this to a  something like this Alex plane  Why in a minute?  Okay.  in a perfect  or ideal gas  Let us make a lot of sense to you. I'm pretty sure that's okay. We talked about things in terms of real and ideal.  Where was how it really behaves ideal is healthier. Ethically, it should be Haven gases. Ideally theoretically should not interact with other gas molecules. There is some interaction Daniel talk about this in chemistry 6p  but gases can be said to be the least condensed State gases have densities that are measured in grams per liter not milliliter because they are so because they because they are so lightly condensed k,  Gases have variable shape and volume. They are what I call a perfect fluid for a simple reason a gas will not only  will not only take the shape of the container that it's in but also the volume.  That is to say that when you put a gas into a container, it will fill up every corner of that container.  It experience.  Because gas is so hard for four people to see.  Because it's so hard for chemists to get this to their heads. It was the last state. However, it is the first state of matter.  That you will talk about in chemistry 6B because since the particles don't interact with one another.  Because it's so lightly condensed. It's easier to describe mathematically and to look at it chemically as soon as you start having particles next to one another bumping into one another you have to take into account that interaction with near neighbors that makes calculations more complicated. There's a term you're going to hear me use again. And again Vapor came, so I want you to understand that vapor.  Is another way of saying gas but here's the distinction.  Vapor is the gaseous form.  Eva material  at the temperature you're studying.  Is normally in a different state can a different phase.  Vapor is the gaseous form of a material that's normally in a different state or phase at the temperature for studying for example water.  What is what is the phase of water? What should the phase of water be in this room? The state should be a liquid. However some of the water molecule because of the temperature.  Have the ability to escape that liquid that liquid state and go into the air.  That's what we call the vapor phase.  Now vapor and gas are the same thing as far as you're concerned. The distinction is more semantic than it is. Anything else will Vapor phase becomes important as a distinction is when you talk about colligative properties in chemistry in chemistry 6B  What about the periodic table solids liquids and gases? Okay, well.  Let's see what good colors we can come up with here. Let's make  gases  now these are elements that normally exist in the gas state.  At room temperature normal conditions room temperature by the way is about 25 degrees C.  I sort of a definition that we use 297 Kelvin. So what are oh that reminds me of something. So what are the gases gases? Hydrogen helium neon argon Krypton. Radon Xenon. Radon.  nitrogen oxygen fluorine  and Corinne  That's it.  11 right  11 of them, okay.  liquids  some missing. I don't think I'm missing any okay liquids.  how to make liquid blue  ready to Pig list  growing  Mercury  time  No, you fail call meaning Mercury now having said that some books will call will will put gallium as a liquid gallium is a weird compound. It is at room temperature. It's it's somewhere between a liquid and a solid melts about 30 degrees C. So we leave it out of the liquid category, but it's bromine and Mercury that's it Mercury. By the way is the only metal. That's a liquid.  Just like hydrogen is the only metal that's gas.  So what everything else everything else is a solid?  Okay.  orders of solids  now  Almost all the elements in the periodic table exist in nature if they exist in nature, by the way, this is something that you should keep in mind almost no elements are found in nature.  uncombined  very few exceptions to this things like oxygen nitrogen and they're really combined.  Almost all elements are found in nature combined with something else. Okay.  However, if they are found if they can be extracted from a compound.  They exist as what are called monoatomic what that means is that when you have a handful of carbon what you have is a handful of carbon.  Adams  k  but there are some elements in the periodic table.  that in nature  do not exist in the monoatomic form.  There are some elements in the periodic table that do not exist in the monoatomic form. In fact, they don't want to be mono atomics some of them in nature.  I found as diatomics in other words X2 where the two exes.  Are bonded together to one another?  an electron pair bond  Okay, so which elements in the periodic table are diatomic?  Let's look at those.  What are the diatomic elements?  the diatomic elements hydrogen  nitrogen flooring  oxygen  iodine bromine and chlorine  Okay.  Those are the elements hydrogen in nature. And now I understand this not combined by itself, but when you find hydrogen by itself  It is found as H2 not h.  Chlorine is found as cl2. Not CL. So, how do we know? How can we remember what the diatomics are?  have  No fear.  Come on grow up.  ice  cold  beer  God is college alcohol time. Okay. I have no fear of ice cold beer. Yeah. I've heard the other one, so don't send them to me.  Okay.  The dirtiest one I ever heard with the primary color ones and I got it from a woman.  I mean I was shocked them I use or roygbiv. That's all I remember. She sent me one that ice. I have been able to burn out of my memory game.  I suppose that's how I learned it. You.  Okay have no fear of ice cold beer. It is important to understand know what the diatomics are. Okay, because when they're by themselves, they are diatomic but here's the important thing to know about this a diatomic element when it reacts with another element.  or with a compound  reacts as if it were a monoatomic.  All of the polyatomic elements. In fact, I'm going to show you one more group here.  All of the polyatomic elements when they combine with other elements.  or react with compounds  react as if they were monoatomic.  It's just that in nature.  Craigslist near diatomic State now that leaves me with the polyatomics now these in some years. I've gone back and forth about teaching this.  Because of the fact that some books some books talk about it and some don't I'm just going to make sure I'm going to write a future-proof you here. So what are the polyatomics there really are as far as I know only three of them K phosphorus sulfur and selenium  Phosphorus is found as piece of for metal p4k.  selenium  is found as selenium 8 that ate selenium is connected to one other sulfur as S8.  This Is How They found in nature than that and so what am I tell you is this even though phosphorus is found is P for selenium SE 8th and Sulphur is sa almost always when we write chemical equations with elemental sulfur phosphorus and selenium, we ignore the fact that they're polyatomics  Another words, we would not write T4 typically in the chemical equation. We were right simply P. We would not write selenium SE. So for example, if we were reacting selenium with chlorine, we would write a C + cl2 the diatomics by the way are always written when they're by themselves as diatomic to give secl4 not  se8  + cl2  to give secl4  No again reason for this has to do with the fact that it's more complicated that they're just at their polyatomics. It's more complicated than just that so we sort of ignore that we sort of ignore the subscript in his case. We never ignored in two cases of the diet onyx  Killer diatomic elements again have no fear of ice cold beer. This just shows you basically what happens for some for whatever reason they would rather be bonded to something. Even if it's one of their own then be by themselves. There's good chemical reason behind this that we won't get into yet.  Now what about the groups in the periodic table?  The groups in the periodic table some of them because of history have been given names. Okay. So what first first of all, okay.  every group in the periodic table  is typically  given or called by its Roman numeral k. So for example this group here.  UPS my dad this group here.  Again, did it again. There we go.  is called  group one or  Group one okay this here.  monse  down here  would be called.  group 7  or  group 7 in Roman numerals or Arabic numbers as matter, which  the ones we don't really call by their group numbers are the ones in the middle now, that's not always how they're called. A lot of times groups are also named based on the leader.  element in that group so that group 4K for example group 4  this group  has led to this group here.  Is cold group 4?  or the carbon  group because carbon is the lead member on it.  Okay, so we can either call it by the Roman numeral. We leaving a out by the way either called by the Roman numeral we can use the Arabic number inside the Roman numeral or we call it by its lead name. So for example, we could say that the group two is the beryllium group but that's in history. That's not how it was. That's not how it's also done. Some of the groups have special names. Of course they do. So let's start the alkali metals.  The alkali metals are this group here Group 1 are known as The Alkali Metals alkaline means they give basic Solutions when you put them in the water. There's some of the most reactive elements in the periodic table are not the most but there's some of them. Okay, so the group ones are called The Alkali metal we leave hydrogen even hydrogen is part of group one. We rarely refer to it as an Alkali metal, even though it's in that it's in that group The alkaline earth.  Are the next group group to typically?  Is called the alkaline Earth's that's those. The term Earth is an old name for oxide.  These are compounds that are found in nature as there are oxides. So for example magnesium was found in nature as magnesium oxide MGO the term Earth.  Is what they referred to in the old in the old times as an oxide these oxides when dissolved in water made a very basic a very alkaline solution so that became known as the alkaline Earth's.  Okay, we don't give we don't really call the elements in between the two sides of the periodic table anything except for transition metals. We'll talk about that in just a minute.  We didn't get over here. Okay, so the boron family 3 is called upon family. The carbon family is called carbon family the nitrogen family called the nitrogen family.  Okay actually have the name. It does have a name. I'll never I won't tell you but then we get a group in. This is the name you all you're really here.  the choke against  The choke engines are another name for the oxygen family. That one is not used very often. It shows up once in a while. That's why I want you to have heard it Chow kitchen is are the oxygen family anything in that group is known as a child kitchen. Okay, but then the last two groups  they do go by their names quite regularly the halogens the halogens are this group here flooring chlorine bromine. Iodine astatine 80  okay, and then finally  the noble gases  let's do that one.  Are those noble gases for long time will called the inert gases until we found out that some of them are a little more Earth than we thought they'd go by the term the noble gases because most of them are they are noble because they are too good to combine with other elements and I'm seriously, okay.  Don't we look at these at these things in here? These are  these are General names of groups, but then there are some block designations they get used as well one of those block designations. I'm going to put in a kind of a greenish color. I think here are the transition metals.  What are the transition metals that are called the transition metals because they are the transition.  From the left side of the periodic table to the right side of the periodic table because they are in a transition between the two at the very bottom of the periodic table are two rows are two rows of elements and you can see where they fit in the periodic table by looking at the numbering system.  the first one  What are known as The Rare Earth that's this group here? Okay, they're called Roar. It's because again, they were found typically as oxide, but they're rare Spectre really only found in a couple places in the world.  That's a long time as you move down any.  As you move down any group in the periodic table the elements become heavier and they become quote rarer  The Red Rooster extremely rare in for a long time people fought that they will because it wasn't enough of them to study. They thought we're not going to be that important Will turns out they're starting they have much more important than people have bought originally, what are the things that are important for as they can be used to form water called room temperature superconductors things that can conduct electricity and magnetism at hot at high temperature meeting room temperature, which means you can do maglev and stuff like that negate levitation. What have you but there's so little of them  On the earth. There's not much we could do with them. They're found their bye. Bye when their form deep in the heart of a star when it collapses. Okay, and then finally there the transuranium  I'm running out of colors here.  Roscoe Gray  the transuranium Czar these down here.  from thorium all the way across to lawrencium  LR now  bullet point something else out in the periodic table notice. What do you notice when you look and and be obvious?  What do you notice when you look at for example, LED versus astatine? What is the one thing that really sticks out on this periodic table to your should stick out.  Cake and it's obvious.  somebody  okay. No, that's not obvious enough.  not the atomic number that's  parentheses  Dora  Right, what do the parentheses mean? The parentheses mean? It is an element. That is either man-made.  or an element that is not  stable in nature typically means a radioactive element an element that doesn't have any non radioactive isotopes.  k  When you see an element in parentheses, those are elements again, we've got to make in the laboratory. They're not ones. You can find in nature typically or if they're found in nature. They have a limited lifetime something along those kinds of lines. I wanted to point this out to you because that's not something that's normally pointed out to you so notice when I talk about the diatomics, what's the one element? I left out.  Can I talk about when I talk about the diatomics remember fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and roll diatomics, but I didn't mention astatine 80 why the answer is simple. I didn't mention it because some man made element.  Is a diatomic if it were if it were found in nature, I'm sure it would be diatomic.  But because it's man-made because it has a limited lifetime because we can't get enough of it to study. We don't know.  Two elements that are in parentheses are elements that are radioactive and easiest way to look at it now.  I want you not now but over the weekend when I look at another slide here in a minute, so don't take off. I want you to look at the main body of the periodic table the main body of the periodic table. Is this whole thing. Sorry. Is this whole thing up here?  I want you to look at the main body of the periodic table.  But I want you to look at what elements in there.  a radioactive  better in we are sorry there radioactive that are that are let's say in places where you should excuse wouldn't expect the radioactive element to be  so take a look through this and then and I'll explain I'll talk about it. Next time. One of them in particular was one of them in particular that I will mention so here again or the periodic table the metals and metalloids in the nonmetals. The main groups are what we call the elements in that that two columns on the left and the six columns on the right. Those are called the main groups. The transition elements are but two are in between down below the lanthanides and actinides which are the rare earth and the transuranium some note regarding the periodic table all seven periods in the periodic table don't contain the same number of elements an acid with a number of orbital's present the first. Only contains two hydrogen and helium.  The second and third. Each contain eight the 4th and 5th. Each contain 18 6th contains 30 to the 7th. Which is still incomplete. Although it has been completed now contains 27. Now a lot of this has to do with orbital something that will talk about a little bit in here and more and Kim six. Hey again, the outlets were broken up into three main categories the main groups the transition metals any inner transition. The inner transition metals are those two are those two groups are those two pair of those two rows. I put the very bottom of the periodic table the rare Earths and the transuranium K. They really fit in the bottom part of the periodic table, but we bring them out because they're not quite as important k,  Each element each group has a set of characteristics group one or the alkali metals tend to be shiny and soft low melting points. They all react rapidly with water to form flammable hydrogen gas and alkaline or basic Solutions. Meaning that if I take lithium Wells do sodium if I take sodium as a solid and I reacted with water as a liquid I will get  sodium hydroxide aqueous AQ means in water  + H2O as a gas, this is one of the common properties.  I'll be alkali metals they form hydrogen gas and they tend to Flame.  when you do it  They get more and more reactive As you move down the periodic table. So lithium is the least reactive of the alkali metals cesium and francium francium. The spray is radioactive are the most reactive. All right, that's enough for today. Make sure that you clicked in if you have it again. I will post the annotated slides this afternoon, make sure your turn your lab reports and makes you have everything ready for tomorrow dress appropriately. See you tomorrow.  Yep.  you can say this what you can do is say "
