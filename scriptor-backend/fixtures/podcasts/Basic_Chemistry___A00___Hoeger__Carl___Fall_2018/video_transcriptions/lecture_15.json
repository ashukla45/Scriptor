  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started. for those of you  Get this thing going here or we go.  so  Talk about this in a minute. If you didn't get a cheat sheet yet get one after class most if you did already. Obviously, you have to get it for me. That would just come to class if you don't come to class and you just don't get one and that's not my problem and again exam is on Tuesday. So let's get you guys clicked in and then lets go through announcements and then all the rest of the stuff that needs to be done today.  So over the sources him. There we go.  So we're stand we  exam one of the first part of this is all information. You've seen already now, I dunno for those of you if  if you  How many of you use to podcast?  If you use the podcast and you notice the for example, the video isn't working which I didn't work. I don't know what the hell happened if if you find it or something wrong with the podcast where did record or something do drop me an email that's actually is something that you can do one or two things either you can send me an email or you can write it or you can send an email to service desk at ucsd.edu. They're the people who handle the problems. I don't know what happened. They said there's a technical issue or it didn't record either this class or my recorded the audio, but not the video part on on Tuesday. So we don't know what happened and I don't even know if they finally got the video. Video up. It was just recorded in floating in space somewhere, but they're supposed to but they were checking on that. I haven't heard anything about it.  but if you find any issues with the podcast  You do need to let me know and this is one of the one of it just so you know, there's a lot of professors at podcaster classes. I'm one of the only part of professors here whose podcasts are open to anybody to listen to you're going to get into class as soon as you have to go out to podcast on UCSD on some classes UC little lock next to them that little lock means. You can't list of those podcast unless you're in their class. I leave my podcast open because first of all, I'm not ashamed of anything that I put on the podcast but second of all because I know that there are people at some point in time we're going to be if they drop his class are there off in another class somewhere they're going to want to be able to get access to it. So I leave it open. So when there is a lapse in a podcast thing is what you don't what you may or may not know you can always hunt through the podcast app for the  Pass quarters podcast find one of my podcast for class on teaching that has all the information in it that has what you need. If a podcast doesn't record, but do let me know about that the podcast I think are important part for some of you it's it's crucial but it also points something else out and this is something I try to point out all the time to my students podcast is not podcast or not a reason not to come to lecture because if they don't record there's always a chance that they won't record and if they don't you missed that lecture and I can be pretty brutal in some classes. So just got to keep that stuff in mind.  The answer to this so we already talked about examone 50% good average the answers to the written part 2 poster uark 4043 the answer to the Scantron are posted on Triton dead along with what you put on your Scantron. I sent an email out an announcement out to that effect last night and so you can go up there and you can actually see what you put on the pot what you put on your on your Scantron in addition to what the answers are. Those are up at the very top of that thing listed by sequence number so you can find your sequence number their exam to is Tuesday. It is in this room. It's up to the end of today's lecture which is we're not going to finish modulate but it's going to be very close to the finish of modulate ionic reactions lab is tomorrow. Remember the new lab schedule.  I have to because it the video parking record. There's some things that just didn't quite you didn't quite see like for example this one here again. We've already done.  The first two of these are finished with the nomenclature quiz at the beginning of lab on Friday. So make sure you get the lab on time because if you were if you're late, or if you miss it, you will just lose that time or you'll get a zero on the nomenclature quiz again. Please keep this schedule in mind as we go forward here. I think most are on the same page with that. So that's not really too big of an issue here again was my business about a solute solute vs. Solvent solvent vs. Solute solvent forces. This was the slide that went along with that part of the discussion. For those of you who didn't get a chance to warn in class and we're looking the podcast I will post the annotated slice tonight or actually I'm try to do it this afternoon if I can all right back to what we were doing here.  Autonomic Like You quiz and lab on Tuesday for me the first 20 minutes you're going to basically going to be you're going to have 20 minutes.  To do roughly to name or give the chemical formula for roughly 20 compounds. I don't remember exactly how many it is, but it's somewhere in about that. So, for example, I'll put down li2 CO3 and you'll tell me if lithium carbonate or I asked you what is gold 3 chloride you give me the chemical formula for Gold III chloride, you'll be given a little periodic table. I'm just exactly like the one you saw on the exam.  and basically it is a it's a it's everything you should know how to do with nomenclature basically, so you'll have about I think you have 10 compounds today you have  You are 10 compounds to write the structure for if I remember correctly. It will take you about 20-25 minutes. That's what I'm going to ask that EA's to to give people to give people for that can be picked up in New York 4030 entryway that is open. By the way. I see this morning that is open 24/7. You can get your exams decide you want to get your exam at 2 in the morning. I wouldn't but if you did I'd you could that area is open air is always going to be open in Terraria. It's not open and there's no exams in there and all the exams are out now so you can get your you can't get your exams are your pick your exams up. I'll tell you the same thing. I think I told you this before but I I tell all my my students this it is a good idea for you to pick up your exams and learn from your mistakes.  And I will also tell you this are counting on you not picking up your exams are also counting on those two people playing on her computer in the back there.  Because without you guys went out to for those of you don't pick up your exams. I was just not paying attention those a students are counting on you because you're the reason they get is a study but they also count on the fact that you don't say so you need to keep that in mind in every class. You take every exam. It's not overwhelming exams over it's over when you get the exam back and you figure it out what you've done wrong. And yes, I hated doing that myself because when I did it I found out just how stupid I was sometimes and the bottom line is as embarrassing as it is to look at it and say God that was a stupid that was stupid. You should take heart in one thing and that is  A stupid mistake is not an ignorant or I didn't know or a knowledge mistake. It's just sloppy that happens slop can be fixed.  Once you know you're doing it you can fix it easy easily.  However, if yours a concept that you're not getting that you need to clear up as quickly as possible, especially on exam 2 because the final exam looks a lot like exam too much more like exam exam 1  exam 2  is going to be all multiple choice.  Okay.  Okay. Now I know your son there's some people going. Yes. Yes. Okay think of it like this.  Remember those written questions on the test think of a multiple choice question. That's a written that the written question in disguise.  Okay, so there's a lot of calculations on this test.  A lot of calculations. That's why it's important that you get to the lecture hall you get here?  By about quarter to 8 if you can so we can get you seated and get you started cuz you will need the full time to do this test. I will provide scratch paper. I will provide a Scantron I will provide the periodic table. You got to cheat sheet. Now the cheat for those of you didn't pick up the cheat and pick one up at the end of class from me. I'm down here and if you don't have a cup with your own on the day, you will be taken away from you. And if you start the exam with it will just fail you on that exam. It look like the app that. One side that has this oldest, you know must be handwritten blah blah blah blah. You can write anything you want on the blank sides, but you'd have to do in handwriting. Okay, and I would do it in such a way that it that you can read it.  Okay, because you have to recant bring the magnifying glass in and it besides if you're using a magnifying glass. It's just  I mean come on. Come on. It's like reading the fine print after you've already committed the crime didn't do you any good the most useful cheat sheet I've ever seen have been ones that have not a lot of information on them. They have for example, if somebody is always and I have a cheat sheet strategies thing up on the web page. If someone for example always mess up with phosphate is they put it on their teaching you don't get a cheaper than nomenclature quiz, by the way, you don't know put that on there. They'll put like an example of a problem.  I'm just remind themselves of how to do it. If it's a problem they struggle with but there's no reason to put things on this cheat sheet.  That are not going to help you. For example, what are the things? Somebody asked me a couple years ago. What would I put on a cheat sheet and in general in general chemistry organic chemistry? I just tell them I put nothing on the cheap because I'm just freaking brilliant when it comes organic on it. So, you know, I would probably take each of the common polyatomics and I'm always running across in in problems like nitrate sulfate.  Hydroxide things like that chromate and I would put their molar masses on their example. What is the molar mass of dichromate I write it on there. You see to Roc 207 - 2 as a molar mass of blah blah blah faster, but a lot of there's a lot of things that people a lot of things it's up to you which put on here. You just can't word process it there's a reason behind that that had to do with people selling cheats at what point in time and not cutting me in on the profits.  The other thing was the other thing what are they even put this on my on my strategy guide? I got to start cheat sheet one time from a student all that set up a cheat sheet was my mother loves me. My mother will still love me.  And I looked at it and I just had to I I did a double-take and I said why why you put that in your cheat sheet because because I know the material at least I think I know it as well as I can and I know that if I make a mistake on here, my mom's not going to disown me I go that's pretty smart. So use it wisely. You're not going to get them in every class you take you will get them in any class you take for me, but you won't get them in every class use them learn how to use them wisely and a lot of times just the fact that you've written it on the cheat will help you in in and how you do things. So that's just a little bit of strategy something. I just wanted to I wanted to pass on to you about this stuff. All right, let's get back to our discussions of a modulate the  Balancing equations. We balance chemical equations on someone came to my office the other day.  Another young lady coming to pay my office and asked me to. I mean, I'd like I I want to do more. I want more practice balancing chemical equations, by the way. They're always young ladies because the young man or just two  Macho to come and ask you know, despite the fact that we don't do with your send their girlfriends and that was a funny one. I had a girl one standing and I heard this guy talking to a woman to a young lady outside my office and I'll make sure you ask you about and so she comes in my office and she says can you tell me where I can get more problems along Bubba Bubba blah and I said to her you in my class. She goes know and I know why you want problems like that. She goes like Oh your boyfriend sent you and then me and she goes yes, and I don't he was talking out there. Don't be afraid to come in and ask but how do you get more props the balanced equation of stuff or first of all, there's a thing up on the web page gone extra storage battery problems. There are some things in there. The other thing for those of you going to chem 6A get a copy of the textbook or go over to the go over to library. It's on reserve over there.  Make a photocopy of the of the of the things at the end of the balancing equations chapter or any general chemistry textbook. The more you balance it the better you're going to get that and the fact it becomes almost second nature after a while. Okay, we did this example, this was the example where I made a mistake and you can see how easy it. Was it for someone to make a mistake did that on purpose?  But let's talk about the basic chemical types of chemical reactions is what you're doing on. This is what you going to be doing on Friday start talking about these things. There are no I am being very generous and again at the end of class. If you haven't got a cheat sheet pick that one then I'm being very simple here in the types of reactions that there are I have seen this list been be expanded into a large number of different types of reactions. Mostly be caused.  There are different types of redox reactions. There are different. There are there are some there are some different displacement reactions people people talk about acid base reactions are all pretty at pretty much the same older. There's really two classes there, but in general there's really only three classes of react there are what are called double displacement reactions in these are typically what we call precipitation reactions precipitation reaction is any reaction in which a solid is formed as one of the products. So for example,  A typical precipitation reaction might be something along the lines of silver plus one.  Aqueous and I'm going to do these azenet Ionix. + let's say chloride - aqueous.  Goes to give agcl solid. This is an example of a  Precipitation reaction but a double displacement reaction is one where the cation and the anion of the two starting materials swap with one another. So for example will see this on the next slide call these swap reactions if you will and whether a swap reaction occurs or not depends on whether any of the products that are formed  either precipitate or form some sort of a non ionic compound  where but it can happen. Okay, don't talk about the double displacement in a minute and oxidation or reduction reaction or oxidation reduction or with caught a redox reaction is an example of what's called a paired reaction. Meaning that you can't have oxidation without reduction. You can't have reduction without oxidation and example of this again in a net ionic since one of these would be something along these kinds of lines copper.  plus one  plus a silver as a solid snake this aqueous.  Going to give silver plus one aqueous plus copper as a solid.  And without actually going on here is that one of the species is gaining an electron the copper while the silver is losing an electron in an oxidation-reduction reaction electrons are being transferred from one species to another. Okay. I'm showing you here with Nettles it can happen with all kinds of all kinds of things that will see an acid base reaction is a reaction that you'll study the most you've already done one of these in class or a blunt doesn't one of these in Labs acid-base reactions the ones we know that we know a lot about they become a heavy emphasis in Kim's 6 be an acid base reaction is one where you have an acid.  What's the base typically to give you something called a conjugate acid plus a conjugate base and we'll talk exactly about what this is. But for example, very simple one would be HCL aqueous + NaOH aqueous.  to give you H2O liquid  + NaCl  Aqueous now that looks like a double displacement reaction. And in fact it is  To a certain extent that to the reason we're not calling it a double displacement reaction is because anytime water is formed as one of the products we usually move it out of that class and put it into either acid base or into oxidation-reduction depending on how the water is formed. So again, it looks like a double displacement that can be treated like a double displacement reaction for all intents and purposes to acid base reaction because in an acid-base reaction acid is reacting with the base to give you the products that we see. So let's start with double D's double displacement reactions are the simplest type. The one most people are Zara very comfortable doing basically in essence. What you're doing is you're taking the cation of compound X in the anti in a compound X  And swapping them with the cat eye in a compound wine and I in a compound why so it's a true swap reaction. If either of the two compounds formed or insoluble in water and a precipitate formed in reaction occurred otherwise no reaction occurs just because they swap Partners doesn't mean a chemical reaction occurred a chemical reaction will only occur if when that swap occurs  You make either a compounded drops out of solution precipitates or you make some compound. It's not ionic anymore like water. For example, you make a molecular compound. Okay. So an example of a simple example of a of a double displacement reaction. Let's just say we have a g and O3 aqueous.  Let's do two of those plus.  Sorry, let's listen to bouncing at the end because I'm going to do something else here Plus.  PD  what's APB? What's not to do that one? Cuz that's in soluble. Let's do silver nitrate + cacl2 aqueous.  ways to give  agcl as a solid we get two of those  ca  no.3  no.3 2  aqueous and that means we would need two of these to bounce this thing out here is an example of a double displacement reaction. The double displacement reaction allows us to get for example, we have two aqueous materials, by the way, the two materials don't necessarily have to be aqueous for this to occur. But most of the ones you're going to run across are going to be with those starting materials or aqueous.  But notice we formed a Sit. We formed a solid now. The reason is reaction moves forward has to do with something called Le chatelier's principle Le chatelier's principle. Don't even try to spell it. You learn about it in the sticks be Michelle Hayes principal says that a chemical reaction will move in a direction to replace materials to remove a stress to replace materials that have been removed from that solution and example that I can use to to sort of get this to get this Friday across is what say for example you have to make you have to make a dozen cookies because if you don't give me a dozen cookies, you're going to fail my class if you've got to make a dozen cookies, but you've got your roommate who's the history major and the roommate who's the political science major the roommate who's major is God knows what cuz I never go to class.  And they keep taking cookies off the plate. Okay. Well, what do you have to do? You have to keep making cookies to keep that in a dozen?  They keep taking them off. You have to keep that it doesn't eventually they beat enough cookies and they can't eat anymore and you finish making your dozen cookies in the reaction you be making stops.  Okay, that's what was shot liaise principal is sort of getting at with chatelier's principle says that if I keep removing one of the products from the reaction in this case is precipitating. The ions are no longer in solution. The reaction keeps moving forward until all of the irons.  That form a precipitate on the starting material side are gone.  Okay. Now again Le chatelier's principle is a very very powerful principal for explaining how we make Chemical Reactions move in the forward Direction something. We'll talk about a lots and Kim 6 p.m. 6 C.  Play chatelier's by the way. I'm not going to put this on the on on the actual slide cuz I never spell it, right.  And sometimes people put that little Hoover over the top whatever that thing is called.  Le chatelier's  k  A very important principle. What are those principles that it's basically how thing and it's how chemical reactions run even ones in your body. So be able to do these to be able to do the  Be able to do these you need to know the solubility rules and you will need to know the solubility rules for the exam the empirical solubility rules. We apply them in the order given and the way that they're given is from things that make you soluble two things that are insoluble. Here's the important thing to remember first of all, these are the empirical  The empirical means bikes pair determined by experiment the empirical solubility rules. They are they have been worked out. There are some exceptions to some of them but for the most part these are rules that we can rely on when trying to predict whether a compound is going to be soluble in water or not. And it applies almost exclusively here to type one and type two compounds.  Notice type three compounds aren't on this but I will tell you one thing about type 3 compound that is gases gases which are almost always type 3 compounds are soluble in water.  How soluble is another story by the way, I'm using the term soluble and insoluble get to it will get to it a slide a little bit where I distinguish between those so what kind of things we can say where the first thing is most common compounds of Group 1 and ammonium ions are soluble change most for our purposes of exceptions and I have to put some ways of words in but most means all okay. So most common compounds of Group 1 and ammonium ions. Ammonia my end being  Nh4 plus group one's things like lithium.  lithium sodium  potassium Etc. Okay to remember  for a compound to be soluble only one of the two lions.  Needs to be on the soluble list if they're both great, but you only need one.  Okay, so any sodium salt?  will be soluble because sodium  Is the cation?  Any ammonium salt will be soluble because ammonium is the cation. You don't need to worry about what the Anna it is most nitrate acetate and perchlorates are soluble.  nitrates  Arrow three- acetates C2  h302 -  perchlorates  clo4 -  Are soluble are some exceptions, but we're going to leave we're not going to worry about exceptions were going to worry about the bulk of everything here. Okay.  now  we talked about two groups that are always two on two sets of irons. They're always going to make things soluble. Now we get into differentiations. Okay, most silver lead and Mercury one salts are insoluble Mercury one, by the way.  Mercury one  is  hg2 2 +  That is the Mercury like Mercury one is the only diatomic metal cation that I know of.  The Mercury one is hg2 2 + Mercury II is HG HG + 2.  So which silver LED and Mercury one salts are soluble. Well, the nitrates acetate super cords or soluble again the rule above.  Trump's will blow it.  Most chlorides bromides and iodides are soluble a lot of times. This is given as rule 3 and not rule for  Because as it turns out the chlorides of silver LED and Mercury one are in soluble.  But the chlorides the chlorides bromides and iodized of almost everything else.  soluble  K LED headlights lead chloride for example lead bromide those tend to be soluble in hot water, but we're not talking about temperature differences here.  most sulfates are soluble except those of barium strontium and calcium which are insoluble which where the hell is  where on Earth are  barium strontium and calcium barium strontium calcium  So the sulfates of the heavier group 2 elements are insoluble to them all the rest of the sulfates are soluble.  Okay, now we start to get into the realm where were talking about.  Other irons and everything from here on is pretty much insoluble unless one of the rules above Trump's it. So for example by the above rules are insoluble this include carbonates chromate sulfide oxide silicate phosphate and hydroxide, if one of the rules above to make something soluble.  Is present the compounds soluble if it's not it's going to be insoluble.  So what you tend to do the easiest thing to do is to look to see if one of the ions in a compound set.  Makes the compounds soluble and if that's not true the compound in soluble, okay.  Most salts involving both multiple charge cations and anions are usually in soluble now. I put this rule in. These are by the same rules you learn in 6A, which is why I put them in live. I've implemented them into one came for the reason is this okay to iron?  So what do I have to irons?  You're a chart. You not to bring my own chalk to the classroom because  people stealing Ry  if I have a plus 2 iron.  Anna - 2 iron  there's going to be a strong force between them. There is something called the cool on big force force km is  Proportional while music portion of something is proportional.  the charge  the cation  * the charge  Xavier lion  divided by the distance  between  the cation  Any anion is written more in scientific terms is it this is proportional.  2 Q of the cation * Q of the anion / r  the cation and anion or some other things that go into this. Okay. Now what it mean in reality is this as the charge of the cation in Indiana and there's a stronger attraction between them and the stronger the koala make a traction the harder it is to pull them apart.  Okay.  Are in fact it's only as their distance to get further from one another and what's going to make them get further from one another.  size  Okay, so as the irons get bigger there get a little bit further from one another but the charge still is the big deal. So when you look for example at solubility Orion solubility of something quite often it has to do with the fact that you got multiple charge cations and multiple charged and ions involved in all of them.  By the way, we won't talk about what the sign of this is, but in general the sign of the force is negative.  If the force is negative, I will talk about this in the next module if the force is negative. It means energy has been released and when energy is released, that's a good thing.  So remember that the the memory or the solubility rules and by the way after Friday, don't don't dawdle do the lab do go home and work on the lab.  After when Friday is over, by the way, if I get an email during Thanksgiving saying cuz you have to turn it in until after Thanksgiving email on Monday before it's too I would have said you back an email saying if I send you back an email saying what the hell are you been doing? Okay, if you want to study for part of this test do the lab work.  Right after the lab.  That's how you going to learn the solubility rules. That's how you going to learn how to balance chemical equations are going to learn how to do these kinds of things do it right after the lab. Okay, especially this experiment  And the only way you're ever going to learn these rules. I mean, obviously you can put them on your cheat sheet. I don't go for it. You're going to learn today. But if you're not if you're if you're if you're one of those Nervous Nellie's nervous norvus, whatever put it on your cheat sheet anything you're not sure you going to remember put it on your cheat sheet.  Your Chichi by the way is not your laptop.  If I don't keep that in mind somebody so of course it's on my laptop. No.  You can't even some people try to use it at the laptop. They put every possible piece of information that could put on it. And there is you can't read the damn things use it just to put information on that is pertinent to the exam. You think you struggle with if you just need a  Paxil just need something to make you feel better. All right, what are the degrees of solubility in other words we're talking right now about soluble and insoluble in this class. That is the Stark distinction that we're going to make an Kim 6 c and a little bit in 6B you got to learn about what's solubility really means? Okay when we say something is soluble it's only soluble up to a certain level when we say something is insoluble.  It doesn't mean that none of it will go into solution. It just means that a very small amount will so the degrees of solubility or something that we're not going to worry about so much but I do want to tell you that there is there are distinctions K and two of the most common distinctions are slightly soluble and marginally is a marginal be marginally soluble. So to simplify this for you.  Slightly soluble materials for all intents and purposes are in soluble.  Okay, slightly soluble materials are in soluble a slightly soluble material is one that for example, maybe you can dissolve.  50 mg in  15 mg in a liter of water something like that.  Most in soluble compounds and hit a little confusing most insoluble compounds are actually slightly soluble.  Because some of the material will dissolve.  Some of it will dissolve.  Marginally soluble compounds are for all intents and purposes soluble.  Marginally soluble means that you can dissolve a significant amount of the material in the water, but you can dissolve large amounts of the material and water.  Okay.  marginally soluble compound  Is a compound that can be dissolved in water?  A significant amount of it can be dissolved in water but not enough to give it this idea of being soluble to be able to make quote a concentrated solution that again the quantification of the solubility which is really where all this comes into play.  Is something that we're going to talk about in 60 + 60 you will talk about it at 6 p.m. 6 but again, let me just simply say this in this course when we talk about something being slightly soluble. We mean in soluble when we talk about something being marginally soluble for our purposes. We mean soluble  by the way  the quantification of solubility  is probably one of the topics I think it's one of the easiest topics we talked about an equilibrium. It is a topic that drives students up the wall. It is far and no farther away. One of the more difficult students have Concepts students have to talk to to understand its solubility how to quantify solubility right now. We're dealing with soluble and insoluble. So how do we predict whether a precipitate will form what we do is we note all the ions present in the reaction. We didn't consider all possible cation anion combinations then we decide whether any of the iron combinations is insoluble based on the solubility rules. So let's say for example  And I will do if you'll see some stuff on some some later slides here. So let's say for example that I start with.  Sodium chromate CR 207 and I start with let's say let's do tungsten 3 chloride wcl free. So we asked our we look at this and we say, alright, what is sodium chromate? Give me with sodium chromate gives me to sodium plus 1 irons plus a CR 207 - 2 Iron Wall sodium ions are soluble sodium ions make the compounds soluble. So we know that sodium chromate is going to be soluble.  And we know that this is going to be soluble.  So we're going to put a queue behind that tungsten chloride. Tungsten 3 chloride that gives me tungsten 3 + plus 3 c l mine co- Okay. Well, I know the chlorides.  Are soluble unless it's silver ladder Mercury one. I know that the chlorides are soluble there for Tungsten chloride should be soluble.  so I'd say all right, this is  So I say all right. This is soluble so therefore I put a queue behind here.  Now what I do is swap the irons.  With the key of one species with the irons from the other species. So in this case, what I would get is I would get  n a c l k and I would get  WW2  CR 207 3  again, I'm just swapping the ion's. Now look at the audience. This one is sodium chloride. Nobody has a problem with sodium chloride, but sodium chloride has a sodium salt. And as soon as I see the sodium solid don't need to look at anything else sodium salts are soluble. So I know that this compound is going to be soluble.  So I know that this is going to be a q.  but the tungsten dichromate  the tungsten 3 dichromate first of all tungsten. There's no rule about tungsten.  Chromate or dichromate dichromate wasn't on the list of things that make things soluble therefore. I've got something. I don't know anything about tungsten. I've got something that's not on the list of anything that makes neither of them on the list of what makes something soluble. Therefore you would predict and you would be correct that this compound would be in soluble.  and therefore  would be a solid.  That's what we just done is in a step number three, okay.  So precipitation reactions are double-displacement reactions and they're the most common ones you run across metaphysis, which is another name used means the place one iron with another that's essentially that's what we're doing. If one of them is one of the products forms of solid the reaction occurred if one of the products doesn't form a solid no reaction occurred  So again, we talked about this idea of molecular equations total ionic equation and net ionic equation. Again, we've already discussed this but simply to put this into into perspective of what we just talked about here. We can say that for example for the equation. We just had we had let me go back over to say what we had here. We had sodium dichromate and tungsten chloride. So here we could write a chemical equation where we had any to CR2 O7 aqueous.  plus W cl3 aqueous  goes to give  WW2  CR CR 207  3 as a solid  Plus  NaCl aqueous if we balance this thing out we need  Two of the tungsten we're going to need.  three of these and that would give us  6 sodium chloride  think I balance that right? Okay, that would be my molecular equation. That's the balanced chemical equation.  Ionic equation shows ionic substances dissociate into ions. We again do not dissociate anything. It's a solid into it science because in solution it's not going to be that so here we would have three.  na + 1 aqueous  Plus  oils for 6 my dad to do this account, right 6  + 3 CR 207 - 2 aqueous  Plus  W + 3 aqueous  + 6 CL mine is aqueous.  goes to give  WW2  CR 207  three of those as a solid again. It's a solid we don't break it up into the irons.  + 6 + a + aqueous  + 6 CL - aqueous  This is the total ionic equation. It's it's an equation you almost never right? It's one that you should be able to write but it's one that's not usually required. Okay?  What we didn't do is look at this equation and eliminate anything. It's a spectator iron and a spectator Ian is any Ian on the left hand side that is in solution that remains in solution on the right hand side.  Any idea that is in solution on the left hand side and remains in solution on the right hand side is a spectator ion. So here  if I go through this I have six sodium's there. I have six sodium's there. I have six chlorides here and I have six chlorides here. Okay. These are the spectator ions. And so when I eliminate those from the chemical equation because they're just carriers. We don't need to worry about them. What we come up with is a chemical equation.  it says that we have to  tungsten 3 + aqueous  + 3 CR 207 - 2 aqueous  call ways to give  WW2  CR 207  3 as a solid this is the equation that explains exactly what's going on. It is the net ionic equation the equation from which we've eliminated.  All the spectator Ryan's net ionic equations are going to beat the equations that you are going to use more than any of the other equations, especially as you move in the Kim at 6, B and Kim 6 see where we're not interested in the spectators were interested in what is actually taking place in the reaction. So net ionic reactions are really important from that in that regard. And by the way,  Net ionic reactions can be written or double-displacement reactions for a lot but not all a lot of redox reactions and they can be written for almost all.  all of the acid-base reactions  So net ionic reactions while we demonstrate those when we talked about we demonstrate those by talking about double displacement reaction. They're not limited to just double displacement k  Here for example is the same thing that I just done against this is just another slide to show this whole thing on this next exam on this next Lab. You will be writing you will be writing the molecular molecular equations. You'll be writing the net ionic sand we're going to assume that you can do with the of the total Ionix on your own.  So now let's talk about oxidation reduction reactions are redox. Redox is short for reduction oxidation. I don't know why they didn't call him oxidar reactions. But he talks reactions is the name that we use. They are reactions. These are the most complicated.  All chemical reactions they are probably the most important of all chemical reactions, but they are very complicated because when electrons get transferred species change not only how they bond with other atoms, but the other aspects as well.  You're going to be mostly asked to identify them and some of the component processes that go on where do the terms come from? The term oxidation actually makes a lot of sense where it came from. It was originally described. I used to describe what happens to compounds and elements when they react with oxygen. Typically we found that when we treated a compound with oxygen.  That it would pick up oxygen that's where the term oxidation came from the term reduction.  Originally came from the idea that we would reduce the number of Oxygen's in something by treating it with certain chemicals. Okay. Now this was before we understood what was really going on, okay.  So oxidation was originally used to scribe again prophecies, like carbon plus oxygen to give carbon dioxide aluminum plus oxygen to give aluminum oxide. Okay, and we would say that the compound that picked up the oxygen.  What's oxidized?  So in the case of the aluminum it picks up oxygen aluminum is oxidized down below. We have a combustion reaction methane + oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water here. The methane is being oxidized carbon is being oxidized in redox reactions oxidation state the oxidation number of a specific element is changing from the left side to the right side of the reaction the oxidation state.  Is a it's a it's a theoretical thing. It's a fictional number imaginary charge.  The atom must bear if there were complete electron transfer between the atoms that make up a given compound or polyatomic ion.  You've already learned how to do this. We talked about this in class, for example, if you have something like  CR 207 - 2 we would say we have to chromium's each chromium is x + 7 oxygen each oxygen is my name is to have a total of -2 overall solving this we would get X is equal to + 6 and that's the oxidation state of the chromium.  So it's a it's a number. It's a bookkeeping thing. We use to say. All right, if I had to have that if I had to pull that chromium away from those oxygens, what would its charge be? This is how we do this is how we do it.  What's really going on is a redistribution of electron not a sharing of electrons but a redistribution. Okay. So for example in the case that you're seeing here on the very top.  what we have is we have a  we have a magnesium.  Ki magnesium as a solid  is going to give magnesium to plus plus two electrons.  So that magnesium is giving up two electrons. That is the process known as oxidation.  oxidation  Is the increase in the charge on the positive side for a given compound?  Oxidation is loss of electrons in k.  What's going on? Also in this case because we're using oxygen. Is that oxygen?  Okay, in this case, I'll do an oxygen. I'll go I'll just give oxygen.  Is gaming those two electrons to become o- to?  Okay here this is the reduction.  The oxygen is going it's it's it's oxidation state is being reduced or becoming less positive and more negative.  Reduction is the gain of electrons.  So I remember oxidation and reduction by saying that oxidation is loss of electrons.  Reduction is gain of electrons or oil rig?  You could also do Leo says ger and if you like to do whatever I can get yourself dirty dirty come out a lab smelling like chemicals.  Oriole rig on fire Dept in the lab. Every time you boil Rick que Lio says girls go look at the animals now, but besides name is spelled wrong redox redistributes electrons.  By the way, don't send me the dirty ones. I've seen them already.  Yes roygbiv. I'm you don't roygbiv is you know red-orange that won the Primary like the colors somebody sent me one time a woman in my class sent me a roygbiv equivalent. That's the dirtiest thing I've ever seen and I mean it was  I still this day. I'm shocked and I have it somewhere and I'll never tell you what it was. Okay. So now we get into vernacular. This is vernacular. You need understand, okay?  In the case above the case here now here we show 8cl shifting elector H and cl reactivate CL.  The magnesium in the hydrogen are both oxidized.  In other words the magnesium in the hydrogen, they both lost electron. That's oxidation. Okay, the oxygen in the chlorine were both reduced because they gained an electron that easy.  Oxidation something is oxidized when it loses electrons. Something is reduced when it gains electrons here is the tough part and just play along with me. You need to know this.  If you underwent oxidation.  That meant you gave up electrons.  To give up electrons you had to give them to something cuz the electrons is still go floating off and solution by themselves. So when you became oxidized you gave those electrons to something.  Something that undergoes oxidation is called a reducing agent.  Something that causes the reduction of something else, okay.  something that undergoes reduction  had to get those electrons that it gained cuz I production is you got to get those electrons from somewhere there for  It's known as an oxidizing agent.  k  So something that underwent reduction.  Is an oxidizing agent something under went with that is something underwent oxidation is the reducing agent. Now, there's a two other terms to get use a reducing agent is called a reductant oxidant is called as another name for an oxidizing agent. So up in here for this one the Magnesium lost electrons it underwent oxidation there for the magnesium.  Is a reducing.  agent and the oxygen here  is an oxidizing  agent  Why you might not think much of this right now when you get into courses outside of the general chemistry sphere like in organic, we use the term agent more use the term oxidation and reduction. We talked about oxidizing agents things that cause oxidation and reducing agents things that cause reduction  Come on.  Nope. Sorry, that's why rules for determining oxidation number. Imma let you go through these on your own. You're not a big deal. Okay there a set of rules that you know, how do you already know most of these rules? Okay, but there are a couple that I want to be I want to be I do want to keep I do want to mention in this list cuz they're unusual.  They have to do with hydrogen.  When hydrogen combines with hydrogen normally combines and hydrogen gives up electrons to become plus one.  but with metals  hydrogen actually will absorb an electron from the metal and become -1. These are a group of compounds known as hydrides Hydra in general are very good reducing agents hydrogen with a negative charge H. -1 is a very good reducing agent.  The other one that is unique in this whole group is oxygen.  With a negative one charge. This is one of the ones that you don't see very often but oxygen with a negative one charge is what's called a peroxide.  k  oxygen with a negative one charge is a rare species to run across.  When are we going to see it will for example if I had something let's I had a compound.  like anime  Oh.  That compound the oxygen has to have a -1 charge because sodium can only have a plus one charge.  k  By the way, the real chemical formula for this.  is na2o to  One of the one of these weird things with peroxide peroxide by the way have oxygen oxygen single Bond the most common peroxide. You'll ever run across is h202 hydrogen peroxide how different is hydrogen peroxide than water H2O if you wake up in the morning and you have a glass of water, you will have a profoundly different experience and if you wake up in the morning and have a glass of hydrogen peroxide,  That'll probably one last glasses you ever drink.  A peroxide is a nasty compound.  Okay.  You can brush your teeth with peroxide and it will and won't it'll it'll make them really bright make a white. Okay, which by the way is all those whitening strips are is there some kind of peroxide don't go out to the lab and get read about it before you go brush your teeth with peroxide, okay?  Determining oxidation state or number we've already done this before but for example, this is that what I did on the I had done on the board. If we don't know what the chromium is. We say to  x x where X is the oxidation number of chromium  Plus  7  x - 2  Which is the oxidation number of oxygen that have to equal -2 and adds to equal?  The charge on the iron when we saw this we get X is equal to + 6 therefore.  It is a chromium.  6 iron  And basically this is used if you really if you're just looking at one element and you want to know whether it undergoes oxidation or reduction. You can actually do this for every compound and see what's going on. And sometimes this is a very useful way to figure out whether you got oxidation or reduction occurring.  Cure for example are a group of compounds. I put these on here for you to do on your own write each one of these out and figure the oxidation numbers from their chemical formulas. Now, what I'll do is what I'll do if I get time today, I'll actually go through and do each of these before I post the slides so that you can see them but you should try them on your own to be able to make sure that you know how to do them. All right. I'm going to leave it at that for the rest of you. I will see you on Tuesday when we have an exam remember exam is "
