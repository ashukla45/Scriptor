  "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started for those of you. And for those of you didn't get a Chichi. Please come down and grab one.  And be quiet while I'm going to announcements.  soy  the  Again, cheat sheets are here today come down and grab one. If you don't get one now, you'll be able to get one at the end of class. So as your if you're just coming in come down and grab one now, once I start lecturing, I don't really want people running running down here to get them.  so  let's just let some make some quick announcements here. So the first thing is the post lab questions from your volume metric lab or do tomorrow.  and also almost  in every lab except for two of them.  You should be able to pick up all of your graded Labs except for me. I think a volumetric one is the only one that might not be done in time. But you all you really have to do tomorrow is to turn in.  All you really have to do tomorrow is to turn in your volume metric post lab questions for discussion and your Louis experiment worksheet that you're doing.  Other than that all that's going to happen in lab tomorrow is you going to pick up papers to leave to be there for about an hour now? I have to talk to the TA to make sure they know that they need to be there. But you can pick up all your stuff at that. All the stuff is great at your pointed at that point in time. There are some things to say about the grading. First of all all the experiments worth 50 points. The problem is going to be that some of you are going to three of the experiments and I said put this into a into a yum an announcement experiment you get back. We're not graded out of 50 points. They were graded out of one was great out of 32 one was graded out of 40 something for three points are they need to be adjusted and they're going to be adjusted on my end. So I'll tell you which ones those are you can simply take your score / / that number.  Turn on the percentage host all of the the totals. I'm going to post on the web sometime this week sometime this weekend or early next week. It depends on.  It depends on one of my Graeter's and this is what really comes did really comes down to is why it took so long to get stuff back to you off podcast.  Okay back on podcast. The Lewis worksheet is due Friday and lab at the beginning. So basically going to turn all this stuff in at the very beginning of the lab that really will be pretty much it. But you do need to come to turn that stuff and you do not have to dress appropriately for the lab because there is nothing going on other than turning in stuff.  Are the final exam is Tuesday, December 11th at 8 a.m. It's in the recreational gym. I told you where that was. Yes on a Tuesday make sure you know where it is. Make sure you get there make sure you there on time.  Cake White young for those of you who are o s d students. You should be getting you will get an email in the next day or so either today or tomorrow. I telling you about what to do, but the rest of you are going to come to to the rec gym, for those of you who will talk to me about sitting in the front you just will self identify and we'll make sure you get there again when you see how the setup is in the recreational gym, it's some it's not like a classroom. So I'm close to a classroom. So be prepared for 4 that the protocols of the exam at each each today. If you didn't get one already or getting to get one at the end of class. I'll make sure they get out to you.  The protocol for the exam is going to be a little different than what you've seen before when you come in. You're going to be told where to sit down. You're going to put your ID on the desk in front of you so we can check it. Okay, I will check it as exam is going on once everyone is seated. There's going to be a pilot exams on the edge of every test. I'm going to have the exams passed out at the person on the end is going to pass exams the other members. I'm sitting at the table. Each table will have 3 exams and three students at it before you come in and we'll grab a they'll be a it'll be a i piled scantrons. There will be a pile of scratch paper with periodic table on it. So you'll come in with that. You put your backs up against the wall. Hopefully it won't be raining. You'll go to sleep where we tell you to sit and then once the exam starts once I called I call exam to start.  Gamzee passed out. You'll put your name on everything but you will not dismantle the exam is really important at the end of the exam.  At the end of the exam what you're going to do is you're going to put your Scantron on top of your test booklet and you going to leave it in front of where you took the exam.  That is what you will get up and in front of you will be the Scantron.  On top of your exam booklet the scratch paper in the scratch paper, you'll take with you. They'll be a recycling bin for you to throw it into but you're going to leave your exam and you're going to leave your Scantron. If I don't have your exam. I'm going to fail you. I don't have your exam. I'm going to fail you. If I don't have your Scantron going to feel you to know. I always tell people and I'll say this again on the exam. It's okay to write on a final exam. In fact, I expect you to I just don't want you taking it apart. I recommend that you Circle your answers on the Scantron on the exam booklet so that if there is a problem with your Scantron, we've had this happen once in a once in awhile, I can always go back and eggs and grade the exam booklet for the question.  You're going to leave your exam booklet with me and you're going to leave your Scantron. You will be able to come back next quarter and look at your exam if you want, but you can't have it. You can look at it and go over any questions. You got wrong, etc. Etc. You're basically the only way they are know what you got wrong is to come and see me, but that's going to be the protocol and you have 3 hours to do the exam will start at 8 and finish at 11. You'll have three you have three hours to do this exam and  The good news is you'll have plenty of time. There are about 40 questions on the test of those how many or calculation is? I'm not really sure offhand but most people finish the final exam.  usually in about 2 hours  There will be people at the 3-hour Mark that we will be taking exams away from there always are at doesn't mean that it took them three hours to some people take their time. And that's okay. You don't have to take two hours. I've seen people finished the final exam in 40 minutes.  Now I won't tell you how they did but I see people finished the final exam and very quick times. Most people will finish somewhere between an hour and 40 minutes in about 2 hours and 10 minutes. That's usually that that's usually the way it goes again advice that I can give you when you're taking the final exam is that once you've answered a question don't go back and change your answer unless you know for a fact you did something wrong move on to the next question if you can't do a question.  Then leave it blank and go to the next one come back to those at the end. There is no penalty for guessing.  Okay, but I recommend that you don't guess unless you really have to okay, by the way, this old sage it says if you don't know what the answer is pick B doesn't work. I've seen this before someone turned it exam actually this quarter where they marked the last 10 questions on the exam or bbbbbb.  Because the old the old SAT Sage with v don't know if the answer is almost always be that's not true.  The answer is almost always anything.  Except usually that so all that stuff is bs. Anyway, a statistically there are statistics by the way to tell you I ran statistics one time on my exam and I get but I won't tell you what the most common answer was because that just makes guessing easier. All right, let's go back over to this thing. I finish this question up some of you have been if you didn't answer this.  Make sure that you do how many core electrons does a bromine atom have.  Brodin in the  of course, I don't have one of those with me.  How many inner or core electrons does a bromine have?  Just so you can see.  Let me give you a quick. Let me see if I can get this to work.  There is a periodic table.  But you might be able to see.  the numbers up above after my 48th class, so  And that is one of the darkest damn things I've ever seen and we go at my work and that's no better.  Somebody switch back over here so you can see what the answers are.  How many inner core or inner electrons does a bromine atom have?  One more time over to the dock camera.  Remember you're looking for inner or core electrons?  So now I'll go back over to the laptop and you can finish this one up.  Okay, last chance is folks.  Correct. Answer is 18 remember the core electrons correspond to the number of electrons in the noble gas?  Right before you get to that element and that noble gas in this case is argon which has 18 electrons the remainder of the electrons.  Bromine has 35 electrons. The remainder of the electrons are what are called outer electrons, an event outer electrons seven of them are valence electrons in the valence electrons are the ones that we're going to be interested in their want to be interested in today as we discuss Lewis structure in more detail. So  skip that down like that and there's that to click in and let's go back over.  to this and finish up and talk about  This so when I ask you to do last time.  was to a no iro means  means on your own this is a detailed step-by-step way to draw Lewis structures now in the very beginning  When you're doing Lewis structure some of the stuff a lot of there's there's a lot of explanation in this but this is how I taught how to draw Lewis structures for years. And if you swallow it, it's no fail. You cannot go wrong, but the only way to get really good at Lewis structures is to draw them into practice them. That's some that's one of the reasons that I have you're doing this this Workshop or they sell worksheet is to give you the chance to practice them. Now, there are some strange things are going to run across as you do Lewis structures. It will talk about toward the end of all this like what happens if you have an odd number of electrons what happens if you if you have charges that are the plus charge next to a negative charge talk about all those kind of things each. One of these is a step-by-step the situation is a step-by-step as to what you're going.  What to do in essence when I summarized it which is down here.  What you're going to do is this you're going to figure out how many electrons you're allowed to use in the bonding picture. Okay, so you going to do that by determining the total number of valence electrons, what you're actually doing is putting all the valence electrons into a pot in essence and then you're going to distribute those electrons to the other atoms to all the atoms that have put into that pot. You're going to distribute electrons as needed to make the structure.  You going to draw the skeletal structure by putting the least electronegative atom as the central atom the central atom is the atoms which everything else is bonded. Some molecules have board one Central atom. This is a key inorganic as you go on your not going to have very many of these kinds of structures to worry about if any  but as you move into chemistry 6B summon, 6A and 6B and 6c where you see a lot and then the 40 series you start to see this I'm come up again. And again the one thing bless you the one thing to remember. Is it hydrogen cannot be a central atom.  In fact, there were two atoms that are never Central atoms one is hydrogen. The other one is flooring. Those are never Central atoms.  You use a line to represent a two electron Bond. You're going to determine the number of electrons left. Once you've bonded everything that you can't the central atom. You didn't go to distribute the remaining electrons until or gone into law or until all peripheral atoms have an octet if there are atoms left over. There is the first thing you're going to do by the way if there's Adams leftover electrons leftovers, fuse me if there's electrons leftover you're going to do a recount. Make sure you counted right make sure that your math is correct if you run out of electrons,  Check your math. Okay, but if your math is correct, if electrons remain they always go on the central atom.  If there are leftover electrons, once you've distributed all of the electrons anything leftovers going to go on the central atom.  Are electrons which are known as radicals in Auto electron is a single unpaired electron will see an example of this in the moment. They go on the least electronegative atom.  which is almost always the central atom generally speaking radicals go on the central atom, but you don't run across a lot of these but if for a like for example, one of the one of the classic radicals  is no  nitrous oxide  This is a compound that actually does exist in cells. It's a neurotransmitter. It is a radical and I think we may or may not do that on today just to go through it. And in that case when you pick which is the central atom there is no Central atom, but for purposes of argument, we would say that the nitrogen is essential because it's less electronegative than oxygen. That's why we needed to know that you're going to create multiple bonds if needed to make our pets and then finally once all the electrons have been distributed once all atoms have locked pets.  If they have all cats you're going to then sit down and calculate the formal charges. There are going to be cases when will see a couple of these where you're going to have to give an atom more than eight electrons more than an octet.  This is a situation arises called hypervalent. See this is common for elements that are. 3 or above for example elements in the sodium line down its. 3 the third row in down they have a ability to do something called hyper valency and I Prevail and see is when you're big enough to support more than eight electrons around, you know, there's arguments about whether hypervalent he really exists or not. We're going to get into that. We're just going to Simply use these rules. So let's look at some examples here and we're going to start off with some very simple ones.  And we're going to look at these things in terms of their Vella the number of when start by counting the number of valence electrons so cf3 carbon.  has four valence electrons  Jerry has seven valence electrons.  We have for fluorines which means we have a total of.  28  valence electrons from  the fluorines which means that the total we have here.  is 32  valence electrons to  distribute  carbon dioxide  carbon has four oxygen has six or two oxygens each one donating 6, that means we have 16 electrons to distribute their  sulfur dioxide sulfur  has s will be better sulfur has six.  There are two oxygens.  Auction at 6 and then there's a second oxygen it has six to sulfur dioxide is a 666 element or compound.  Okay.  So what's 6 + 6 + 6 that means is 18 valence electrons sulfur dioxide always make these jokes sulfur dioxide is what happens when sulfur contacts oxygen k  sulfur dioxide smells like hell  It really does. I mean, how do I end up but I know that what else smells like but the bottom line is if you had to describe the smell that's what you'd have. So it's rather interesting that I find it has this kind of it this combination.  If you were in a room full of sulfur dioxide, you know because you don't know you wouldn't cuz you be dead. Alright phosphorus.  phosphorus  po4 -3 phosphate what do we have here? We have phosphorus has five valence electrons. Okay Spas prices in the same column is nitrogen. And now it has four oxygens. Each oxygen is 6  So that's six six.  But it also has a -3 charge and -3 means I have to add three.  electrons for the minors charge  each mine is charges one extra electron. So if we go through this we have five we have 12 24 24 and 5 is 29 30 31 32 this as a total of 32.  Electrons to distribute each of these but I'm going to start off with cf4.  And I'm going to do cf4 on the board in and I'll put the structure down here as to what it really what it what it looks like once we're done. So if you  go back to look at what we have K cf4 has a total of  Cf4 has a total of 32 valence electrons. So let's go back one slide.  To this do we determine the total number of valence electrons 32 valence electrons, right? So we have 32  4  Cf4, we put the least electronegative atom in the middle.  The carbon and then what we're going to do is distribute the remaining atoms around that carbon. So I'm going to put a fluorine hear of flooring there a flooring in there and a flooring there around it in a square for no reason other than it's just more convenient to do it. That way. I'm then going to connect.  each flooring  true that Central carbon with a line where each line.  Is two electrons. Okay. So what that means is that I have on my account over here. I have 32 - 2 4 6 8 - 8 K so  That gives me how many left.  Army  24 so I have 24 electrons left now here is something you need to remember.  You have 24 electrons left. You don't have 26. You don't have 22 you can only use the electrons that are left. If you run out of electrons, you're going to have to do something else. If you have too many electrons are going to have to go on the central atom but all electrons need to be distributed. Okay electrons until orgone or peripheral atoms have an octet in this case the best way to do it and this is where kids screw up. I don't care some of the ways you learn how to do this in high school were just wrong.  We're just wrong. Sometimes you in highschool. I'll turn this off cuz I don't want High School teacher sending me emails.  I always right.  No, the bottom line is the bottom line is there's more and more people going into teaching who are teaching at the K through 12 who have degrees in chemistry. But the thing is when you graduate school in chemistry as an undergraduate chemistry can usually find a job real quick teaching is in, California.  Sorry reality.  All right. I'd still rather be teaching you though. All right now.  Here is the key right here is the key.  You need to distribute the electrons.  As fairly and evenly as you can and if you don't do it this way, you're going to run into problems. You going to specially in cases where you don't have enough electrons. So let's distribute the remaining 24 in this is how I have found the best way to do this. I take each peripheral atom. That is not a hydrogen.  And I add two electrons to it. So I'll go to here.  Then I move to the next one put to their they move to the next one put to there.  Go to the next one input two.  So what I'm doing is I'm going to give I'm going to be like I'm Distributing candy. I'm going to give each of the peripheral atoms.  one more pair of electrons  Can I go to recount and see how many I left over or what account as I go along? Okay, so I go.  2 4 6 8 now I'm going to put another pair up there 10.  12 14 16  now every one of them has got two extra pairs of electrons to Lone pairs.  size 16 18 20  2224 and once I've used those electrons up, I'm done. I don't know more to distribute.  Now there's a second thing you want to do as you're going along and that is to count our cats anytime and Adam gets an octet at that point in time. You need to look at it and say okay. I'm not going to put any more there unless something at the end of this thing tells me I have to well, let's look in count octet. That's one side of electron. The first thing I'm going to go back and do is Count octex. I have no electrons left over.  Okay.  I have exactly enough electron. But let's see if everything has an octet. So this flooring has 2 4 6 8 share electrons count for both atoms to force. 682-468-2468. Each fluorine has an octet. What about the central atom? 2 4 6 8 all the atoms have a cat's I've distributed all the electrons so that I'm done.  Except for the very last step which is to determine the formal charge of formal charge on the surface.  Sounds like it's not something that doesn't sound really important but it does it is because it allows you to make predictions about a about reaction. So what is formal charge once you formal charge is the charge that an atom has to bear?  Because of the way the electrons were distributed it is a charge that an atom has to Bear because of the way the electrons are distributed.  molecules and atoms in general do not want to carry a formal charge unless they have to  okay. Well, how do we calculate the formal charge the formal charges simple? It's the number of valence electrons that atom normally has  from that I subtract the number of bonds and from that I sat I substitute the number of nonbonding electron nonbonding electrons.  Are Not Alone pair is to nonbonding electrons have to be careful. It's not lone pairs. It's nonbonding electrons each. Nonbonding electron is two lone pairs. So if I calculate the carbon, so let's start by doing the formal charge of the carbon.  Formal charge of the carbon is going to be equal to for the number of valence electrons that has -4 bonds.  -0 it has no extra electrons on it.  On the Lewis structure has no extra electrons on it. So this means that the formal charge of carbon is 0 and we never show zero formal charges.  Okay, and what about the flooring? Let's do this flooring here.  The formal charge of the flooring is going to be equal to 7 the number of valence electrons each fluorine has this flooring.  As one Bond on it minus one.  minus the number of nonbonding electrons, which is 246 - 6  Which again gives Florina formal charge of 0?  so at this point in time  we have the correct structure fluorine has its formal charge of zero carbon as a formal charge of CR now.  In practice or sorry in Siri, you need to go around and calculate the formal charge of every flooring but in practice you don't know and I'll tell you why.  If you look at this flooring this flooring has one Bond.  and three lone pairs of electrons  any flooring in this mall in this molecule that has that exactly that exactly same bonding pattern.  Any flooring that has the exact same bonding pattern will have the exact same formal charge.  Do any flooring that has one Bond and three lone pairs of electrons will have a formal charge of zero. So what this means is that I only have to calculate the formal charge of one fluorine.  To know what the other ones are so they're all 0 so that means is that at the end of all of this?  at the end of all of this my structure  cf4  Is a carbon?  with a fluorine are  flooring there  as we did on the board flooring there a flooring there each flooring.  has  6 electrons around it three lone pairs  And there is my correct structure for cf4.  There's a piece of why we're doing this but none of you are probably probably going to understand are going to get a feel for really understand until you move into chemistry 6C and then later on to organic series that is if we know what the structure of we don't the Lewis structure of our molecule or compound we can make predictions about the reactions it will undergo  Right now we're just interested in being able to draw these things. But once we've learned how to draw them eventually we're going to bring into the discussion how we can use the structures to make predictions about how things react. So now let's go on to a more complicated slightly carbon dioxide carbon dioxide remember has 16 valence electrons. Let's put that up here.  So what is 16 valence electrons, so I'm going to put a carbon here.  I'm going to put one oxygen there.  And one oxygen there, okay.  So 16.  -4 means I have 12 electrons left. So now I'm going to do exactly what I said.  We did for cf4. I'm going to take those 12 electrons and I'm going to distribute them in a very fair and even package to the two oxygen remember carbon is a central atom. It doesn't get anything until I run out of Doling the electrons out to the peripherals. So I'm going to go to 4.  6/8  1012  I am now at 0k.  Now account count and see if you have aught cats. Let's do that. Well this oxygen here.  Has an octet this oxygen has an octet, but the carbon.  does not  when atoms don't have octet what we have to do.  Is start to share not redistribute in the way. We distributed the electron but we have to do we have to take an atom that has an awesome cat and have it sheer its electrons with an atom that doesn't so the way I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this in a very simple I'm going to do is very simply I'm going to start by moving one pair of electrons in like this.  And I'll explain the air why I use this arrow in a minute.  So now what I've got is a carbon.  with a double bond  By the way, it doesn't matter what pair of electrons in Belen.  Can I paint like this now again count octet and if I moved apparent share  I didn't move away from that auction at oxygen still own still has still can count the till council's electron toward its octet. So this oxygen over here has an r k  This oxygen has an octet the carbon still doesn't the carbon now has six electrons. So it needs two more now here is where we run into a situation where there are two different ways. We can achieve  what we need to do and had to get his act in the eyes to get that carbon to an octet one way to do this and I'm going to do it like this one way.  Let's deal with blue is to move this in like this. I'm going to call this path a okay so path a  Leads me down to this.  Oxygen on. Are lone pair. They are one Bond like that. The Bluebonnet is the carbons is the electrons. I moved in there carbon double bond.  I guess now does everything have an octet now?  Yes, everything has an octet. So we're golden on this one. But I told you there was a second way to do this the second way to do this would be using.  the other oxygen and moving the electrons in like this will call this be  So, this is Pappy.  So what does path be look like will path be as an oxygen?  Okay.  And it has that like that, okay.  Now does every atom have an octet?  Yes, okay two different ways to get an octet. Now. We've distributed all the electrons everything has an octet. Let's calculate the formal charge. No again, if you remember what I said before as long as you looked bonding patterns long as you calculate the formal charge for one atom and that's the same bonding pattern as that's later on in the in the in the truck once if I do that when I'm going to find is this the formal charge of this oxygen are we go?  So the formal charge of this oxygen is going to wind up being 0.  The formal charge of this carbon is going to be 0 and the formal charge.  This oxygen is going to be zero.  Over here if I calculate the formal charge.  Is equal to -1 for this one?  Formal charge of the carbon is still 0.  The formal charge of this oxygen is going to be plus one.  Again go through Angela's calculation to be sure that you know how to do them. Okay?  The question is I've got two structures.  Which structure?  Which structure is a correct Lewis structure?  Who knows if you watch the videos, you know the answer both of them why because to be a correct Lewis structure you have to have used all your valence electrons up and you had to make octopus and you had to put your formal charge it we've done both of those but this leads us to another question, which of the two is the better Lewis structure.  And the answer is a in the answer for a being the better one is simple no formal charges.  This both are correct.  Both are correct. But this one is a better.  Lewis structure for the simple reason it has no formal charges. Okay, that's it. But one is better than the other one.  Notice that these two Lewis structures are interconvertible.  By moving only pairs of electrons no atoms just pairs of electrons. These are examples.  Of what are known as resonance?  structures  resonance structures are Lewis structures  Did have the same general connection Adams?  but differ  in movement in or different positioning of double bonds and or unshared electrons.  Resonance structures are something that honestly at this point in time, I don't really expect you again. This is where we're going to expect you to be expect you could draw a resonance structure. If I ask you expect you to understand a lot about resonance structures are drawing all possible resonance structures that something we say a little bit for 6 a.m. And then very much in this in the 40 series, but it's important you understand that resonance structures are important.  And a very key aspect.  Again, all this the correctness of Lewis structures. That's what we just went through a minute ago. The best Lewis structures are going to be the Lewis structure for every atom has an octet.  The best Lewis structures are those that if possible don't have any charges in them.  Okay.  The best Lewis structures are those that are going to have no like charges like a minus charge or plus charge on an adjacent atoms.  And the best Lewis structures of those are going to have the minimum are going to have minimize charge meaning they have the charge the smallest total number formal charges present as possible. So  what you do will see that in a minute. I'm residence, which is this delocalized electron pair bonding another words to Resonance structures differ by the movement of pairs of electrons. What do resonance structures do carbon. Dioxide is example about this. We use a special Arrow to indicate resonance. No residence is resonance represents is with called D localization of electrons.  It represents the fact that electrons can be moved from one atom to another.  Without without changing the connection of the atoms.  Nobody important of resonance.  Is that first of all neither structure exactly depicts the bonding in the molecule, especially from a reactivity standpoint the actual molecules a hybrid of all of its resonance forms, and I will see this in phosphate in just a moment. But for example what we do going back to carbon dioxide  in carbon dioxide  what's really going on is that we see this structure bouncing back and forth between the one on the left and the one on the right?  However, it spends about 99% of its time.  as the one on the left  because that one has no charge.  versus the one on the right  so when we draw a Lewis structure  understanding of possibilities for resonance structures when we're looking for them.  Understand that there is resonance structures when we draw Lewis structure what we draw.  Is what is called the most stable one the one that meets that set of conditions that I had put up a little bit ago, okay.  Again, the significance of this will become clearer to you.  As we move on or as you move on through your chemistry and especially as you get to organic.  If you know anybody in my 40 a class or you know, anybody that's taking a game from me and ask them about residents.  And then after they stop crying.  You ask them why residence is really important. I can get into them and literally have to beat it into them. Which inorganic means you just give me a question on an exam which they can't do if they don't understand residence residence is important when you get out of here because residents explains a lot of things we can't explain otherwise, let's do sulfur dioxide and I'm going to jump run through this one sulfur dioxide has 18 valence electrons. So when I get to Sulphur Dioxide, I have my sulfur here.  I have one oxygen there one oxygen there. Okay. So 18-4 is 14 electron left.  I go to 4 6 8 10 12.  -12 electrons give me two electrons left over each oxygen has an octet as I've been counting along. I have two electrons left over at the end again, I recount and I realize I'm right so I put those on the central sulfur like that.  Again, I go through and count our cats. This oxygen has an octet.  This oxygen has an octet of sulfur does not so I'm going to take one of the oxygen and moving electron-pair in like this.  That's going to give me this as my Lewis structure.  Okay, by the way, I couldn't move the other one in there two resonance structures for this one as well. I could have moved a pair of electrons on either oxygen in.  same  I get this if I do the formal charge calculation when I get is I get a formal charge.  Of -1 for this oxygen for the sulfur I get a formal charge of plus one.  After this oxygen I get a formal charge of zero, so I would write this structure like this oxygen sulfur.  Double bond oxygen like this like this.  And every atom that has a formal charge I would put that formal charge on it.  Okay. Now here is the first time we run and we run up against.  This idea of minimization of charge is best and we went up against the idea of hypervalent C.  A plus charge next to a mine is charged very hard to keep a plus charge at A- charge when they're not next to one another from neutralizing each other. And in fact, one of the way to do this would be to take a lone pair of electrons and moving in like this like this.  oxygen double bonded to a sulfur  double bond to the oxygen  Don't like that. Okay now if I do the formal charge  all atoms  have a formal charge of zero.  Look at the sulfur how many electrons does a sulfur have around it.  10  this is an example of hyper valency.  Elements in. 3 and above. So for example from the rower sulfur is and below that  Can do something called expanding their octet?  Can do something called expanding the octet.  and in doing so  That molecule by sulfur expand its octet because it's big enough to park an extra pair of electrons around by expanding its octet. That's sulfur.  Is able that molecule is allies able to eliminate two formal charges.  I didn't start this structure.  oops wrong one  this structures  Is the best representation of what sulfur dioxide looks like sulfur is hypervalent and each oxygen is doubly bound to that sulfur by the way just to kind of show you why are Lewis structures? So important that something from Mike M48 class obviously obviously things get complicated fast.  That's okay. You only got about a year before you get that. Okay?  Here is phosphate.  No phosphate is an example.  Another kind of sulfur like example, but here is where residents really shows off the molecule in the center of the structure in the center.  Okay this structure in the center for Phil's everything about phosphate that we know every atom has an octet.  We distributed all of our electrons and we calculate formal charge but notice in this mall in the central structure. The phosphorus has a positive charge. Each of the options has a negative charge which means that there are four possibilities.  For us to do Chihuahuas that positive and negative charge by moving electrons to make a double bond between the phosphorus in the oxygen. So, for example, we could take this pair of electrons here.  Move them in like this.  And get this one up there.  We could do that for all of the we have a black oxygen red oxygen green oxygen and a blue oxygen we can in turn turn each of those into a double bond one by one and in doing so we can't eliminate all the formal charges, but we can eliminate two of them.  This is an example where residents really play. It really shows its power.  overall structure of phosphate does not have  Are oxygen with a negative charge and one oxygen one phosphorus of the + charge what it has?  Is it as 3 oxygens with negative charges and no other charges in the molecule, but that those three negative charges.  Those three negative charges are being dispersed over for oxygen atoms.  Over 3 oxide oil 404 that's what residents does instead of each oxygen having to Bear a full.  A full negative charge it only has 2 it only has to Bear a fraction of a full negative charge. That's what resonance allows you to do. It allows you to distribute the charge evenly throughout the molecule.  Again, let me see where I am in this whole thing here. Yeah, I have time.  If I were to do an O and let sin always one of those ones that is a kind of a unique one if I do a no.  Nitrogen has five valence electrons oxygen has 6 which means this has 11 valence electrons.  I take the nitrogen.  Make a bond of the oxygen. So that's too so 11 - 2 is 9.  Which means I have 2 for 6.  2 4 6 8 and I have one electron left over that goes on the nitrogen again. I put my electrons on the on the peripherally out on the oxygen okay to start with.  The oxygen has an octet but the nitrogen doesn't so I move one pair of electrons in from that oxygen.  That gives me this.  structure  k  I notice the nitrogen does not have an octet. The oxygen hat the nitrogen has seven electrons around it. And that's the best you ever going to be able to do.  When you when you go between resonance structures is another important thing you can only move pairs of electrons. You can't move single electrons. Okay. This is an example of what's known as a radical.  A radical is an is a molecule.  Where one of the atoms has a single unpaired electron on it, and it does not have an octet an unpaired electron. Not an octet these radicals do exist there very reactive.  They do exist. This is actually a neurotransmitter on a neurotransmitters is formed when you run and exercise.  It doesn't make a lot of sense how an atom can be a radical but these things happen to be caused the fact that it's so reactive. It's not going to last very long, which is kind of part of the the whole thing here.  Again, you are there's a cousin was there were there might be one radical on that sheet that I gave you to do, but you don't want to cross these very often until you get out of General chemistry. But again radicals are an interesting species by the way calculate what the formal charges on that nitrogen, you'll find that it is zero, even though it does not have a notch cut. That's something to keep in mind formal charge Adams without  Adams without an octet do not necessarily have a formal charge.  Adams without an octet to not necessarily have a formal charge calculated if you're not sure calculated anyway, okay Bond polarity electronegative values again. I'm throwing this in just simply to say that when two atoms are bonded to one another if one of them is more electronegative than the other.  If one is more electronegative than the other.  The bond will be polar.  Polar bonds are reactive bonds.  So if two atoms like a fluorine atom hydrogen and fluorine or carbon in a chlorine are bonded to one another.  There is a polarity.  In that bond in such a way that the more electronegative atom has a larger.  Density of electrons around it then the less electronegative. So in the case of in the case of polar bond, what we do is we use this Delta symbol.  Where Delta means partial?  It's not a full formal charge don't even consider don't even think they confuse it like that.  What this in this case partial positive here partial negative here tells us.  Does the electron density now? It's not it's not charged. It's it's a partial charge that the electron density is such that the chlorine has more electron density around it. Then the carbon.  Because it has more electron density around then a carbon the bond is polar because the bond is polar. It's more reactive.  No matter what. The chemical bond is not what this slide is. It's a little more confusing than your light than I'd like but it's actually not too bad the arbitrary cutoff between something between the bond being mostly ionic and mostly covalent is when we're somewhere in about the 50/50 about the fifty percent ionic character range. And what does this really mean? It means that as the electronegativity differences between two atoms gets larger and larger the bond becomes more like an ionic bond and less like a covalent bond.  As the two as the electronegativity values get closer and closer. It becomes more like a covalent bond than and ionic bond, but what this really says is this  every ionic bond has some covalent character.  Every covalent bond has some ionic character.  polar bonds  Have more ionic character or have polar bonds have a higher degree of ionic character.  the nonpolar bonds  polar bonds are more reactive than nonpolar bonds.  Had to have a polar bond. All you need are to elect to atoms that have differences in electronegativity or significant differences in electronegativity. There's one exception in all this I like to point out and that is a carbon hydrogen bond carbon hydrogen bonds should be poor.  Based only on electronegativity but they're actually closer to be nonpolar and polar. So when you have a bond between a carbon and a hydrogen covalent bond is really highly covalent has very little ionic character in it. But as carbon becomes bonded to Adams like nitrogen oxygen chlorine bromine flooring phosphorus. We see a increase in the polarity of the bond.  Molecules with more than one Central atom. Basically, I'm just going to tell you they exist you might have one or two of those for example, something like an H2O h.  This one has to this one has a Lewis structure.  It looks like this theoretically or practically has to Central atoms. What is the nitrogen? What is an oxygen?  now  Typically, if you have more than one of the atom of the lowest, electronegativity other than a hydrogen it's going to be in this class of compounds, but let me simply say this a lot in this class Nori going to see this in the six series is much generally once you have more than one Central atom. You have to be told something about the molecule like for example, what is what we call the sigma connection of atoms. In other words are dabs connected together. You have to know other pieces of information before you draw Lewis structures example, this one here.  3686 white asked you to draw the structure of C 686. Oh my gosh, I would get more structures that I would know what to do with.  What is the structure of C 686 will the structure C? 686 is this?  This is the most common one.  Is that how the hell you going to know? What's that unless somebody tells you that's the difference once we start getting two molecules have more than one Central at there's more information. You have to be given  Final notes before I let you go through dimensional structure on your own. What I want you to do is understand that.  When we talk about molecules.  The atoms are arranged in the lowest energy configuration possible. And that usually puts the elect everything as far away from one another as possible. This is what's known as Vsepr structure. Alright, finally final exam is a week is next Tuesday. If you didn't get a cheat sheet come down and grab one. I'll see you guys on Tuesday. "
