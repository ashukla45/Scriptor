Somebody was complaining about that the other day. All right. Now we can start date. Alright, let's click in using letter D. Please just for my own amusement.  I might know a lot of you when I was their performance question today, but I know there was a lot of you could shake it out of bed because of the bee was it was today earthquake day or something like that fire alarm day. Yeah, that's right. It's funny because I'm sitting in my office. I hear the alarm go off and I watch all you guys coming out and going like man. I'm so glad I'm not a student anymore.  If there's a fire at school put it out, you know.  Cuz it's probably my fault. All right.  Let's go.  Over here and make a few Jeff you a few things. I want to say and then I will get back into the into lecture and stuff again lab tomorrow. You have to be prepared for this lab. The really bad news is tomorrow. I'm going to go through the labs and I'm going to throw people out if I think  get your clothes don't look right. So if you don't have a lab coats, if you have if you have stuff that the pants on or or skirts or whatever and you're showing any kind of skin. I'm going to throw you out. So and if I throw you out you basically don't have any recourse except the zero that you're going to get for that lab. Now. There's a big issue about skinny jeans. It's come up again. This is mostly a woman thing female thing because I don't think men wear skinny jeans, but if you do man, that's just not right, but  Skinit does the fingers really I get definitions from everybody women about what was the skinny jean by asked three women. I got three different answers if I asked the guy to go out no butt.  The answer to this usually is the term skinny jeans got coined number of years ago because of the fabric that they use and because they're tight now it was since that time skinny jeans and started be made in any's Cotton Blends, like for example polyester and cotton the bottom line is what I want you to wearing lab or cotton jeans got sweatshirts a sweat pants whatever for a lot of people this is where I sort of like draw the lines on things where to buy socks or not shoes. You have to know that the other thing is your lab coat should cover down to about your knees. Okay. So a lot of really skinny jeans and I've seen it been tight here. Okay, whether it's under your lab coat and what I look at more than anything is I look from the knee down and if it's been if there's some Bag some baggy  From the knee down. Usually unless the fabric is some kind of like yoga pants. Fabric. I'm just going to let I'm going to let it go. And again if he comes very much a t a specific is Professor specific as to what exactly we we can and can't allow in there most of the time we can allow in there or anything is going to react with the chemicals. It better that you're going to come in contact with young lady was in my office the other day we were talking about this and I simply said the rule of thumb is this if I told you right now to stand up and strip from the waist down, okay, if you cannot and I would give you a demonstration, but I don't want to freak you out if you cannot drop Trow.  In 5 seconds probably too tight. Okay, because that's about the time you're able to have five seconds. If you catch on fire you get something on your on your clothes. You're not going to have much time to get them off. And by the way modesty doesn't matter if you've spilled something on you and it's starting to burn the stuff to your skin. And that's one of the problems with the Blends polyesters nylons things like that tend if they get some chemicals on a certain chemicals we work with they will burn they will start to actually melt and I'll melt into your skin. That's not a very pleasant. It's not a pleasant feeling and it hadn't happened before but with reasons that you don't need to know about but I've had that stuff it's not it's not fun. Okay chemicals are one of those things that you learn real respect for them. The first time something goes wrong, okay.  And when something goes wrong if you're lucky.  Are you going to wind up with is some burn on your hand or something like that? If you're not on life. If you're unlucky you could lose a leg got a friend who almost lost a leg because he's still the chemical on it. One of the ones I used to work with all the time. He was like he was he was lucky because he got into he jumped in the sink and got wind got water all over it now exactly how it happened. It's still anybody's guess we still believe it was a safety violation is what he did is he was doing something stupid. But according to what he told us was it was something else with the chemical he was working with it could have been gone either way cuz it was when I was kind of chemicals that if you just got a little careless or even if you weren't careless if you were just unlucky and it got on you it was going to be bad. Anyway. I just wanted to point that out. Please be please be really ready for tomorrow. I'm Experiment 2 is due by noon today.  questions, it's come up a couple times in in the teenage of ask me this and they're supposed to be paying attention to the to the to the  to the lectures and every once in a while. I think they skip over some of the beginning stuff data must be in Panama speak elected in pain. But after that you could do what you can do all your calculations in pencil because calculations aren't data calculations our calculations question our question, but the data the data cannot be altered. That's why we put it in pain. That's why we put it in the pan. So the tears are on a talk to them. They know pretty much that rule to thing is in this is why is there so much confusion is because I told you guys last time  The rules in a real laboratory in an industrial laboratory or in a laboratory where you met at some at some point in time be required to go to court with what you have there. Pretty much everything in the laboratory. Notebook that you don't have notebooks everything your laboratory notebook must be in pain and the whole reason behind that is because as soon as something is in pencil, if you white something out if you scratch something out you completely invalidate everything on that page and sometimes you can validate an entire set of experiments and I could tell you about a company  Data, basically lost almost a billion dollar lawsuit because of that and if you think that the guy who did it had a job after that, you're sadly mistaken. In fact, not only that that's the kind of stuff that follows you around for the rest of your life. Now, obviously, you're not going to court with your lab notebooks, but it's a habit to get into pain is good. The problem with pain is for calculations and stuff is that you still make mistakes and Crossing them out looks uglier than erasing them so you can do it on another sheet of paper and copy it over. But I would you say use pencil for your calculation to put date on it beta always must be done in pain. I'm exam one is next Thursday. I'm going to talk more about that on on Tuesday at the exactly what it's going to cover even nomenclature going to mention nomenclature today, but that's a self-study module and that's something there's only one part of nomenclature could be on the exam.  I am going to get into determination of chemical formulas and that is something else that will little it'll be on the exam next Thursday and I'll talk about that next Thursday the exams going to be in here and you need to be here before 8. Yeah.  No, no practice exam 1 exam want no cheats on exam one because exam one is easy exam to practice there will be a practicing if there's not one up there already. It's as we start to get two more more calculations, then you wind up with them practice exams are needed but I warned you about this afternoon exam one time student came came into my office and was infuriated because they said there was nothing on this exam that was on the practice exam.  And I go wrong. That was a practice exam there were questions exactly like the ones on the test on that exact. Okay. Sorry, what part of practice don't you understand? Okay. I am never going to give you a practice exam. It's identical identical to the questions. I'm going to ask you on the exam but they'll be similar if you've been doing. Have you been listening to playing along with the lecture, you know kind cuz questions about ask you again. The first exam is not all that. It's a it's we just done a lot of little basic things. It's not that bad the exam that gets you know how to do weighted average is obviously a man ask you something like that could be some lab kind of questions on it. The second exam. Will you start geometry is where you need to do more practice and that's again there's more  Populations there comes out of just being a I was getting some practice in.  Are the off starting up there? I one last thing before I get into this before I get into the rest of the discussion today has to do with graphing and this is something that is a sea. Where are we? There we go. I wouldn't this is something that I want to mention to you I make you do a lot of different graphs in here. I make you do the my hand and there's a couple reasons for that serve. What are the things that that is lost and not taught in college is how to treat data you guys when you take a lab they tell you exactly how to treat the data draw this do this do that. No, I do that as well. I mean, I it's just simpler some it's simpler that way for some experiments.  data is something that you don't know how to analyze until you actually have to analyze it and graphing data is the easiest way to analyze to see things that you wouldn't see otherwise, so  what what are the things that I try to get you to do is to do different graphs. I also want them bigger cuz I want you to start to see if there's a curve in the graph if it's linear or not. But what are the things that I said that you should practice not so much because you have to adhere are different types of grass take one set of data do this on your own if you have extra time and just do take back the penny data do a histogram do a line to a scatter plot do a pie chart do I kiss do I do a bar graph and look at the data and how it's presented in those different format and you'll notice that in some cases and in the case of the penny histograms or more to the point of bar graphs.  Actually show that breakpoint much much better than any of the other graphs. And again, it's subtle playing with date. I have had experiences in my life where I have just out of sheer frustration. I tried one graph on the data that dated it didn't make any sense hundreds and hundreds of points that didn't make any sense until I put it into a certain type of graphic all of a sudden it made complete sense as to what was going on. But up to that point in time it didn't and that's one of the things I want you to get in the habit of is when you're looking at data if you get a chance to graphic graph it to see what it looks like because sometimes that will tell you things and graphic by different methods or different ways if you've ever gone into Excel, why do you think there are so many different ways you can plot data.  And the reason is because there are so many different ways to look at the data. Some of them are useful some not so useful. All right, let's get back to you on this properties of ionic compounds is where we finished off last time, but I want to get ionic compounds are easy because ionic compounds ionic compounds you can explain using coelomic forces plus charge with the mine is charged. But how do you describe covalent compounds now in the periodic table, how can you tell whether a bond between two elements is going to be covalent or it's going to be ionic and the answer to that question is look at the distance between the two elements in the periodic table. The further two elements are away from one another in the periodic table the more ionic bond.  The closer they are in the periodic table to one another the more covalent the bond. Now that have to do with this idea of electronegativity as elements get closer and closer to one another in the periodic table their electronegativity their ability to hold onto electrons.  How they share electron gets closer and closer to one another. So if you look at for example, the periodic table and you said and I asked you for example, something like this, what would be more covalent a iron aluminum Bond or an iron-nickel Bond? And if you look at it you say when I remember seeing a compound that had those kind of bonds in that. Well, that's not the question. The question is which of the two would be a more ionic which one's more covalent. And in this case the more covalent Barbie the iron nickel because they're closer to one another.  The more ionic would be the iron aluminum quad again. How covalent a covalent bond is how ionic and ionic bond is our is a different question and let me just simply say this. There is no such thing. Sorry, that's not 100% true.  It is rare to have something that is a hundred percent ionic or 100% covalent. For example sodium chloride. That's the first I want to call pound. Everybody wants to do to point out sodium chloride is about 80% ionic.  The 20% that's left over is covalent. So even ionic bonds have some covalency even covalent bonds have some iron density to them now generally speaking. We could we consider a compound to be either ionic or covalent. When one of the two bonding motifs is in a large excess over the other one, for example, you can get all kinds of people telling you numbers but when someone a bond is for example, 70% of one type of bond or another we typically say that it's just that 70% ionic or higher is an ionic bond. Sometimes people use 60%  If it's 70% covalent, we say it's a covalent bond again all bonds have a little bit of both character in it. Now give this is something we'll talk. We'll touch on a little bit more in this class but more you'll get this in 6A. So what is a covalent bond while it's a bond formed when atoms share electrons anytime atoms share electrons, we have something called a molecule to molecule was just a vernacular that we used to talk about him all about a species tell together primarily by covalent bonds with two atoms come together electrical interactions curdes. These interactions can be attractive or repulsive. This is the same thing that we see an ionic bond except in a covalent bond. It's a little more stuff because here they're sharing electrons in ionic bonds with plus charging a mine is charged. But as soon as you start talking about sharing electrons, you have to I have to think about the fact that you Adams.  Together they're attracted together it at some point in time.  They start to repel one another and they start to repel one another because they get in each other's space electronic space when the attractive forces are stronger than a repulsive forces and you'll see the song of slide in a minute a covalent bond is formed in the atoms. Stay together. Okay, if he atoms are too far apart the Saturday attractions are weak if the atoms are too close strong repulsions occur in both cases. No bonding occurs in other words for two atoms to bond to one another.  They must be at a position with respect to one another where attractions are at a maximum and repulsions are at a minimum.  You are at a Tipping Point where the attractions are at a maximum.  Repulsion to write a minimum at that point the covalent bond has formed.  When are optimally separated not only this the bond for me forms because energy is at a minimum and that's what we want and energy mineral. That's why bonding bonding occurs because the bonded atoms are lower in energy than either of the two atoms when they're not bonded to one another.  Bonding occurs because two atoms are at a lower energy than the separate atoms are when they're not bonded the distance between the nuclei at this minimum energy point is called the bond length, by the way. That's the same thing. We talked about in the covalent bond that are the distance between them. So again here was here's what we're looking at in a ionic and a covalent bond and a covalent bond the two atoms come together. You have electron clouds around of the electron clouds the nuclei are repelling one another but there are attractions.  No, again, a lot of this will become more clear to you when you talk when you get into Camp 6 a.m. You talk about fundamentals of bonding and you talk about for example, how big were politicians are and how big the attractions are so you see attractions between the nucleus of one and the electron cloud of the other.  UC repulsions between the electron cloud of one and the electron cloud of another in the nuclei of one in the nuclei of another okay.  So this idea now at our as the number of electrons increases so do the number of repulsions in this is one of the reasons that as atoms get bigger.  Atoms get bigger the repulsions get bigger and the bonds get longer.  Lauren Barnes real function of the fact that the two atoms can't get that close to one another before repulsions kick in.  And start to play Havoc with that Bond formation.  From a graphical standpoint. If we were to plot energy K energy on this axis here versus bond length on that access their what we see is this now this is for hydrogen out here. We have two hydrogen atoms.  And as those two hydrogen atoms approach one another the attractions start to increase. So what we're seeing here is we're seeing attractions.  or the attractive forces  at some point  We reach what is called equilibrium.  Bond distance or Bond length  and this is the  distance is when the two atoms are at an optimal distance from one. Another that bonding is at a maximum notice that very quickly as they start to get closer and closer together. We start to see this curve jump very very fast. These are due.  to the repulsive forces  the bond length indicates that point where attractions are at a maximum of lower the energy of the molecule to a maximum. The repulsions are where you start to see them start to push away from one another to get back to that Bond length. The interesting thing here is this if you look at the right side of this graph the attractive side that changes depending on the type of bonding.  It looks similar.  But they're different types of bonding ionic covalent coordinate covalent just interact the interests interactions that how that all that curve looks depends on the kind of Bonnie. However, the repulsive forces look almost identical that part of the curve looks almost identical for every type of bonding in other words, whether you're talking about a covalent bond or an ionic bond, once you're inside that repulsive area, they all go up about the same and in fact repulsions,  Go up.  As one over our to the 12th, meaning that as atoms get closer and closer together that repulsion goes up very very fast.  Polyatomic ions are one of the most iron ore most important of the irons that you got to know that the most complex and are the ones you need to start memorizing these I will ask you what the polyatomic ions are on the exam and you will need them for nomenclature composed of more than one atom and the bonds Within These ions are covalent. We talked about some of those for example, for example o c l -  CO3 -2  po4 -3  CN - 1 there's a number of these things sulfate so4 -2 is a number of these things within them the atoms within the polyatomic are covalently bound to one another are covalently bound to one another but as a whole they carry a negative charge. So for example cyanide in this is another thing I wanted to point out for you cyanide as a carbon with a triple bond to a nitrogen a lone pair on the nitrogen and a lone pair on the car when you get this will make more sense. We talked about Lewis structure.  The negative charge is actually on the carbon atom.  And until and this is something I want you to understand at this point in time.  I'm not telling you where those charges are. I'm telling you what the charges on the iron where the charge is on at Ian.  Will become clear once you learn how to draw them.  k  Where the charge is on the iron will become clear?  Once you start to learn how to draw them.  In Lewis structure something. We do toward the end of the course, but here's something you should know. Okay, what if you're in an alley?  and some for some reason it's 2 in the morning here in an alley and some big dude with a knife comes up to you and he says  Tell me where charges on phosphate or I'm going to stab you and you go. Holy crap. We're going to learn that in camphor yet.  Here's the thing.  Almost always in any species any polyatomic that has oxygen in it. The charge is always on the oxygen there are rare exceptions where it's not  but if it's pick or die.  Oxygen, how do you say oxygen? They let you go. You say phosphorus not so good.  you sort of  dirt dirt parts  Okay.  When you look at me.  What you see is what's this put it this way? There's a history won't go any further than that.  Okay, most polyatomic ions contain oxygen and another element their chemical formulas are shown by subscripts. And how many of each type you can see those formulas up there. So paper example is composed of one sulfur atom and four oxygen has a charge of negative to the entire group of atoms acts as a single unit. And this is the thing. I want you to remember about polyatomics even though polyatomics  even though polyatomics have  more than one atom in that the entire group of atoms acts as if it were a single unit sulfate for example is so4 -2 but structurally.  sulfate  the dots indicate lone pairs of electrons  Again structure this thing or I again the actual how we draw these things will make more sense later on. What are the negative charges on is on that oxygen. The other is on that oxygen using what are called formal charges a formal charge is a charge that an atom must carry.  Must carry because of how its electrons are just are distributed. Now again, almost of this will become more clear to you later.  So alone along the lines here. I've been talking about molecules bonding and Lewis structure will talk about Lewis structures later. But you look at these compounds up here. For example ch3 ch3 o h ethyl alcohol. We know looking at that compound that that is a molecule. We know it's not ionic because the elements better in it are all party girl close to one another and electronegativity. So they're going to close to one another in the periodic table hydrogen by the way can be thought of as being almost in the middle of the periodic table from a standpoint of this. So how do we represent compounds like this? Well, we do this with Lewis structures and again will do Lewis structures in more detail later on. For example,  B / c h 3  ch2oh  would look like this where each line is a shared.  pair of electrons in k  These are unshared.  Or what we call Lone pairs.  Again, at this point in time, we're not going to worry about the Lewis structure. But during the course of the rest of this course, you're going to see me show you the Lewis structures of the things that point some kind of thing something out about it as we get to the end of the court and of Kim for me start doing Lewis structures, you'll start to gain an appreciation more of what this is all about. Again Lewis structures or something that you're going to learn a lot about in 6A and then you don't see them very much through 6 p.m. Through 6, they show up here and there and then you get to organic chemistry. That's all Lewis structure.  I can't tell you how many times do dogs come in and they say why and we're not very well in my 40 in my 40 series classic wine Lauren. Very. Well on 6th and I go not my problem.  To learn Lewis structure learn nomenclature. A lot of these things are stupid the things that you have to learn a sound like you're stupid, but they all do have a Rollator on again this class. We're just taking you through baby steps here. We're getting I'm assuming you don't know what Lewis structures are. So I'm going to show him to you. I'm assuming you don't understand what a lone pair of electrons are shared pair of electrons are even though you might have a vague idea. And if you do know what I'm talking about you're going to worry about it. We'll find something very quickly. You don't  Okay, what is module for so what I'm going to do is I'm going to jump so this is and lecture.  And in lecture 7. All right. So what I'm going to do really quickly over there by the way, that's organic.  So let's I'm now this is a self-study module. So I'm not going to spend I'm going to spend very little time on this. This is all this is something you're supposed to be doing on your own.  and  most of it is not going to be important until you get to in until after the exam but there are some things I do want you to know for the for the exam and I'll get it I'll get to those in just a minute and I can start the next module which is on a pond structure or on a determining chemical formulas with something to do tomorrow. So the first introductory comments always like to do this they going to give you a feel for why we even talked about this junk nomenclature is how chemists relate to one another what compounds they are experimenting on in with and it had to be standardized. Okay for example there.  Most of you have heard of a compounds called barbiturates right that you heard of a barbituate. Well, those are drugs street drug have other drug other uses as well. Well, what is the name barbituate tell you about its structure will for me it does tell me something about a structure because I know what a barbituate looks like, but if you told somebody in in another country with never seeing a barbituate, it wouldn't know what you're talkin about barbituate was named after the count was us are the chemist who discovered barbiturates named it after his wife Barbara.  True story. Obituary part we don't know where that came from. But the bottom line is he didn't name it after his wife Barbara and then there was a time when that was the standard if you found a new class of compounds you could name it and you could give it almost any name you wanted. So for example, there are names of historical significance oil of vitriol. That's another name for sulfuric acid H2 so4, you know what the troll is mean nasty sulfuric acid is mean and nasty, okay.  Where was the troll is h2so for this is one of those names that came out of?  This came out of The Alchemist blue the troll is what you get when you take copper.  And mix it with sulfuric acid while sulfuric acid reacts with the copper and the blue Vivitrol is cuso4. And it's cold blue victrola because it is a blue colored compound that you get from Cut reaction of copper with sulfuric acid. Laughing gas is n2o call laughing gas because when you breathe it, it makes you giddy.  Richard sleepy but make a guinea why the first earliest anesthetics the problem is that there's no real logic region researchers Pacific. So to get around this weed. It is systematic naming sister. The answer was something called the IU Pac which stands for international Union of pure and applied chemistry IU Pac is the group that came around and standardized standardized nomenclature and they standardized it's so again, we could talk about it in in this class. We can talk about it in Russia. We could talk about it in China we can talk about it and Indonesia and we'd be talking about we talk about calcium carbonate we're talking about exactly the same thing. So this is known as standardized nomenclature came out now, we're going to go to the nomenclature. The nomenclature learning is the simple that this visit the Noms.  Very simple compounds and there's just it's the way we want to do it to know because you're gets very complicated as you start to get two more complicated compounds, but we're not going to worry about that worried about the simple nomenclature in the only way to get good at it is to practice it in for four typical inorganic molecules into organic compounds and molecules. We're going to classify them into two general classes. Those that are ionic the ones that have a metal cation and anion metal and iron or metal cation in a polyatomic ion. Those are purely ionic compounds. Okay, the second class are what we're going to call type 3 compound. These are those that contain only nonmetals metals in it, and they're covalently bonded to one. Another everything is covalently bonded okay of the first class.  Classify those into two general classes. We're going to talk about those who have won only one possible positive oxidation state. These are called type 1 compounds knows it have who's metal has more than one possible oxygen oxidation state. These are type two compounds and you need to learn what the type 1 metals are in the type two metals for example sodium  is a type 1 metal, it shows up in a psionic form only as sodium plus one calcium shows up only as calcium plus to aluminum as it turns out shows up only as aluminum + 3, but then there are metals that can have different charges different oxidation States, but those later  Depending on the devil. So for example iron can be Iron plus 2 or iron can be iron.  + 3  chromium  Can be + 3 chromium could be + 5 chromium candy + 6.  And so as you might guess you could have different compounds depending on the oxidation states are on East on the charges these Metals carry with them. So we need a nomenclature system that takes all of these things into account. It has to take into account. First of all, whether the compounds ionic or not. It has to take into account whether the metal.  What are the metal has a fixed charge or variable charge and if it has a variable charge it has to be able to relay that to the person reading it another word. Is this an iron to war and iron 3 in the compound and then finally have to have a nomenclature system that allows you to designate to somebody that what you're talking about is a covalent compound something like a type three cop out something like carbon dioxide something along those kinds of blinds.  The type what elements are shown here on this slide? Basically, the simplest thing to do here is memorize them.  what type three elements are shown on this slide and if you notice on this slide  This break point is that break point that you seen before so it's the break point between the metals and the between the metals and the nonmetals. It's the metalloids that metalloid line and so from a standpoint of nomenclature, the metalloids are considered.  Nomenclature standpoint there named as if they were nonmetals k y o by the way, the black are the elements that don't form compounds at all at least as far as we know no Krypton or are going on here is one of the black ones that was actually there are a couple compounds that are known but there are so reactive. We just I haven't decided to change that one over so we know what the type one and a type and the type 3r. What about type 2 will type 2 is everything else? That's why you memorize what the type ones are and the type 3 and the and the type threes. And again the type ones. There's not that many everything in in in the group want everything in group 2 and then that other small group that we have aluminum zinc gallium silver and cadmium  The only other ones in that, you know where the type threes everything else is Type 2 and type two compounds are ones. They can have variable oxidation States LED can be + 2 or plus 4, for example, I guess it depends a lot on what you're reacting it with and how it was reacted. So this gives us over all this thing that I called the the nomenclature periodic table where all elements in it and you can see almost all the elements of these type two elements have been classified according to that according to what we've said. They're okay. So a lot of this comes along this is going to get easier with you with practice and you are supposed to be watching the watch this self study module. Here are the basics of how we named them in Essence Atkins make I can simplify this out for you type ones twos and threes the first part of how you name them is exactly the same.  You name the first element?  Willits element name you name the second element in it with its name as if it were an anion so it's an oxygen it's oxide queso CO2 carbon dioxide carbon. Dioxide Miss K Co carbon monoxide Sor I'm sorry Nao sodium oxide Fe iron oxide to the first name the first part of it's easy. It's element name for the first element. And then Anaya name as if it were now for the second part where the difference comes what you do next. If it's a type 1 out of its type 1 metal. You just leave it as is its type 1 metal you leave it as is if it's a type II metal you have to distinguish what the oxidation state is.  What the charge on the metal is?  You have to figure that out either algebraically or usually algebraically as I can figure it out and then you have to relay it to your reader by using Roman numeral k and those are put into parentheses for type 3 compounds.  Where we designate those are we make those different is the first name of the element first one is always the element and then we tell how many atoms are present by using a Greek prefix like mono. I try Tetra something along those kinds of lines. So,  Are lions are the anions are ones. You just need to know but Anna and you're pretty straightforward because essentially you just take a lot of them a lot of them but not all of the musically take off in the last part of the element root name and add IDE to it where that changes is when you get to the polyatomics we get to wear changes is to polyatomics the polyatomic anions in here in the polyatomic anions. And then you need to learn these there's no two ways about it. Just need to learn these okay it over here. What I've done on this slide is I  Play why did certain ones that end in ate.  And I'll tell you why those are important to know because if you know what the name of the iron that has it doesn't have a prefix in front of it, but ends in eight letter words to say paper in front of her hypo benzoate if you know what to charge.  If you know what the charge in the number of Oxygen's are present.  you can figure out all the other ones and by the way when you see the term 8  awwright as a suffix  It means it is a polyatomic that contains oxygen.  a polyatomic that contains oxygen  Don't wear the ones there's one on here. I do want to point out to you. And that's this one hydrogen carbonate.  let's do this one carbonate, which is its official name is also known as by  carbonate  Also known as bicarbonate that's one you have to know bicarbonate is it's what we call trivia lure, name. Unfortunately, that's a common name that gets used more often than hydrogen carbonate now again on exams. If you call it a bicarbonate that'll be fine. If you call hydria the car hydrogen carbonate, that's fine K. But once you get out of this class you are going to see that Ryan go by two different names either hydrogen carbonate or bicarbonate. So why have you learned these 8 science the first of all the polyatomic ions as a whole?  All come from some acid.  They are the anion portion of some acid. So for example  something like  something like chlorite K. This one right here comes from hclo2.  That I am that polyatomic ion came from an acid that polyatomic ion came from an acid.  Norman clature of the oxyanions which is in which is useful to know.  Really is based on knowing what the iron it ends in ate is but has no spill prefix to it. And so if you know that and you know, how many oxygens it has you can figure the rest of them out if I'm by the way to charge doesn't change and you need to know the charge on these if you lose one oxygen.  The suffix goes from H tight.  Okay.  If you lose one oxygen the suffix goes from 8 to 8.  If he a'ight loses one more oxygen.  Or if he ate loses two oxygens.  We put a hypo in front of it. So it becomes a hypoiodite iron.  Hypo means it's it's got less than it needs that it needs. If it has one more oxygen than the quote than the 8 we put / for hyper in front of it. So perchlorate. So for example, if you know  that CO3  if you know that CO3 -2  is carbonate  you know that if we were species Co  -2  by the way to charge doesn't change if the species existed. This would be a hypo.  carbon height  Again, it's two car. It's two oxygens. It's got two oxygens less than the 8. That's why we know it's that if  We had this was Co 4-2 this would be per.  carbonate  So again, you take whatever the thing. Is that the 8th i n whatever that is if it has one more oxygen, it's a parade if it has one less. It's an i8.  If it has two less, it's a pirite and the other reason for for that being important to know this is because based on that and then here are some practice compounds for you do will talk about to turn me to charge here in a minute is because the name of the assets would you also need to learn comes a directly comes from the name of the anion. So if you know what the anion is carbonate, for example, the acid that it comes from is very easy to name because it's a very there's a very strict very good set of rules for that know, how do we determine the cation charge for a type 2 Ian we do this algebraically and it's based on knowing what the anions are antibiotics do not have variable charges.  Cory Louis B - 1 sulfate will always be mine is too. You just need to learn those. Okay, if you know what the anions in their charges are and you know that a compound is neutral and has a charge of 0 and you also know that if a compound has a charge  if that charge has to be equal to the sum of all the oxidation States all the charges of the elements involved you can solve for this algebraically. So for example, or fe203 you take the number of irons, which is 2  And you multiply it by the charge of iron which in this case, we're going to make axe.  Hey, so here.  The number of irons is too. We don't know what the charges were going to call that acts.  The number of Oxygen's in this thing is 3 oxygen always has a charge of mine is to again and he and I and if you look at the alliance oxygen is a -2 and that's what we're going to get for getting the that's why we're getting the second Adams charge from  That has to be equal the charge of fe203 which in this case.  Is 0 solve algebraically and we say that this is an iron 3 and iron plus 3. So this compound would be an iron Roman numeral 3.  oxide  Roman numeral 3 telling me that it is an iron + 3.  But we can do this.  Polyatomic ions as well, even though you would not think this right off its right off the bat, but you can do this for polyatomic ions just as well. So for example, if I would have asked you what is the charge?  If I were to ask you for carbonate, for example, if I want to say what is the oxidation state of this is not a nomenclature question. This is an oxidation state question something you're going to need to learn how to do if I were to say, what is the oxidation state of carbon in carbonate what you would do with the same kind of thing. You would take the number of carbons one.  * the charge of carbon which we don't know is X  plus we have three oxygen each oxygen. Remember oxygen has this oxygen is going to be negative to the second element in these polyatomics. The second element is considered to be the anion portion.  This is equal.  2 - 2 overall that mine is too coming from that. They're so X.  Plus a minus 6 is equal to a -2 K. So therefore X has to be equal.  2 + 4 so we would say that the oxidation state.  The oxidation number of the carbon is plus 4K.  No.  if carbon is + 4  How many electrons did did it lose?  4  so how many electrons does carbon have?  if it's + 4  K2 what element has 2 electrons around it?  Helium again, we get back to that noble gas that noble gas kind of thing.  And in fact, that's one of the general rules that you can predict what the highest oxidation state of something is going to be by looking at the periodic table and seeing how far you have to go to a noble gas does not work for the translation for the transition elements. So these are the kinds of things you need to do it. For example, I asked you to go CR 207 - to calculate what the oxidation state for chromium is and you should get that. This is a chromium plus 6 or a chromium.  vi4 as Roman numerals  Again practice this in the end. If you're doing the stuff, if you're doing the the things I've asked you to do again nomenclature of a type three compounds a little different here here. We do not use because of covalent bonds. We don't indicate charge. We don't we're not going to indicate the charge instead we're going to do is use Greek prefixes to tell us how many of each of the elements is present. So to is dye-free is try that kind of stuff. Okay?  the Only Rule  it is the only thing that's different here that you have to know is this.  The prefix mono is not used for the first element and what this means is this no type 3 compound.  begins with the word mono  if you're naming a compound and its first thing is model something you dropped them on. Oh, okay. It's just understood if you will.  Nomenclature practice practice Center practice and practice now unfortunately, nomenclature has some exceptions in this is really part of what I wanted to get into here. There are some compounds who have IU Pack names, but nobody ever uses it water should be dihydrogen oxide. Nobody in their right mind calls it that okay.  its water  There's this there's a great with a great YouTube video years ago of somebody walking down the street offering people on the street a glass is saying I'll give you $5 if you drink this dihydrogen oxide and it wouldn't do it.  If somebody did that to me, first of all, I'd say you can't work the camera but the second of all I'd go okay. I know what it is, but the bottom line is if you don't know recognize what the name is it was water. They drink it probably would drink it the heartbeat. Okay. But again, this is a common name water is a common name and it's white. It's never going to get to go away on this Friday put some of the more important ones you need to know. NH3 is ammonia. Nobody will ever call that nitrogen trihydride. Simonia. CH4 is methane Monday run across occasionally silane sih4 phosphine ph3 and 2H for something we come across rarely is hydrazine usernames or just Unfortunately they have they are not are you packed but they've been in use so long and her so accepted that they have become the IU Pac names.  oxides of some nonmetals will sometimes be named as if they were type 2 compound now, this is something  but you're not going to do you're going to name them you're going to name the compounds according to the rules of nomenclature. I gave you your not going to do this, but  there is history here in the history. Is that a lot of the elements in the periodic table were first discovered via their oxides and so elements in the periodic table that we would not expect to have her example of type to name oxides for example will be named like that p205 which should be die of phosphorus.  Pentoxide is very commonly known as phosphorus v oxide even though it is not a type II compound got that name historically. So we seo3 selenium selenium for our selenium 6 oxide. Okay now,  Where this becomes Gray?  Is with the metalloids metalloids should be named.  Metalloids should be named as if they were type 3 compounds but occasionally metalloids will get named as if they were type 2 or type 1 compounds in this class. You're going to name the way I told you to but once you get outside of this class, you will see it. Sometimes named other ways just have to remember that there are lots of exceptions to these kinds of rules.  Text like this. What are you? What's the nickname? What's a nickname you use for someone who's called Robert?  Bob or Rob  How about Richard?  Rich dick would help dick come from okay again, there are there in anything is unfortunately some of these exceptions.  Show-Me's exceptions are never there just they're so common. There. They consider to be common.  There is one very bizarre nomenclature that gets used and this has to do only with type II it's where is only found in type 2 but it's only found when there's only two common oxidation state like in Iron stick method now, I do not use this this people tried to face this out for years. It just won't go away. No way it works is this if you have to ients  To our ends of the same metal.  The Lure charged iron it only works if you have two of the lower charged iron uses its Latin name Latin prefix + O U S on the end of it it's higher oxidation state uses the Latin name + ich on the end of it. So for example iron 2 plus is the fair Russ iron iron.  Fe-3 plus is the fair Rick Ian again again.  This only is used when there are two common oxidation States now far as I'm concerned the way I would ask a question along these kinds of lines as I would give you the two oxidation States and I would say which one is the IT guy in which one is the US on which one is the Stanek? Which one is the stand us Ian again us is lower oxidation state dick would be the higher oxidation state in this works for all of them. Finally compounds containing hydrogen or List it as the first element are acids and the acid nomenclature is something that's just need to learn which is also in this set of slide hydrates are something  That we run across and they are unusual, but you need to know how to name them.  So for example a hydrate is a solid compound.  And that's important. It is a solid compound that has water in its Matrix. So in its crystalline Matrix, so for example, something like caso4 and we always represent these with a.  Let me do this with let me do one. That's more.  For H2O and this is a solid. So how do we name this, This is an example of a hydrate that. Tells you that it's a cat. Tells you that whatever follows the. Is in the crystal structure. So we have to name this compound the way we name it is we name the first part of the compound itself as if it were a type 1 type 2 type 3, we may not normally it's how we treat the last part of this. So when this compound we would say that this is calcium.  sulfate  the indicate that were talking about a hydrate we're going to use the word hydrate.  And then we're going to tell how many oxygens there are by using a Greek prefix prefix. So this would be Tetra hydrate. So this compound would be calcium sulfate tetrahydrate.  If there is no hydrate behind the name.  Or there is no any no. In the chemical formula. It is said to be anhydrous meaning without water.  k  Almost all compounds. We run across our anhydrous.  By the way, once you dissolve it in water the term hydrate goes away.  because now we're talkin about an aqueous something is dissolved in water again something that we'll get to later on. Hydrates are one of those chemical formulas that you just have to get used to. By the way means is associated with  so this would be calcium sulfate associated with for Waters and it always means it's in the crystalline state.  Acid nomenclature is something that you need to get used to acids or easy to figure out what an asset is an acid is any compound that begins with an h and its chemical formula?  And the number of aitches in the beginning of the chemical formula are the number of acidic hydrogen's so for example hc2 H3 O2 is an acid practice and acid known as acetic acid one hydrogen is acidic.  The other hot three hydrogen's are not acidic. So only the hydrogens in the front of the formula or acidic. So in this case.  in this case  What's up with this looks like is it looks like this C3 hydrogen's on the carbon hydrogen's on carbons are not acidic a carbon oxygen double bond.  Then an oxygen and the hydrogen in this is the acidic hydrogen again, I don't expect you to know that I'm showing you from a Lewis structure. What's going on here? How do we name acids that sort of the the the key and all of this there two types of acids there a binary acids and binary acids are acids. I'll simply hydrogen and some iron.  Some non oxygen containing iron like a nitrogen like a sulfur, okay.  For those compounds we had Hydro.  To the front of the sulfur name and we had tick acid to the end. So H2S and of course sulfur has to be the one element. That doesn't obey this correct H2S should be Hydro Celtic.  Are Hydro saw her? I'm sorry should be according to this hydrosulfuric acid because we're using the root but because that didn't sound right. They said okay with salt for just use the word sulfur so that becomes hydrosulfuric acid, but then you get the eye for example, hi hydroiodic acid again, here. We are using the root ayyad.  K again it gas it to the hydro in the front and that's the key the hydro in the front.  NEX gas and tells us it's a binary acid. Okay, no acids if they if they are not oxoacids acids contain oxygen be an acid you need to be in water. So these compounds are aqueous if they're not aqueous if they're in some other phase they are named as if they were normal compound.  They are named as if they were normal compound type 1 or type 2 or type 3 compound.  The oxalic acid nomenclature is a nomenclature that people really that people will struggle with but it's the one you need to know oxoacids or not hard to name if you know the name of the anion and it's very simple.  if the anion ends in ate  we dropped the eight and a dick acid to the end of it.  Okay.  If the anion ends in ite and doesn't matter if it is a prefix or not.  If he and I and ends in eyesight.  we add us acid ous acid to the end of it and the way we can figure out these things as for example if we were to look at  H2S 03  Are Aryan is SO3 -2?  And the reason we got to this is we added.  2H + has to neutralize those two negative charges. This is sulfite.  So this would be so Furious.  acid notice no Hydro in front  notice, no Hydro in front  Kyle  Okay, I getting more practice for you.  types of chemical formulas I want to know in the last few minutes here and I do have so I do a 5  I want to start the next module again. What do you need to know for the exam when examining to know the name of the polyatomic of the polyatomic ions? Cuz that I will ask you naming compounds is going to be something on exam to Angela have a quiz on this later in the quarter probably week 6, okay, but module 6 is where I want to start because this is going to be something you're going to be dealing with starting tomorrow. How do we  How do chemical formulas What do count chemical formulas tell us and how do we determine them in the first place? The first thing you have to understand is that atoms are so small it to be able to conveniently describe how many of them we have or how much of them we have we have to use a number call. We have to use a quantity a standardized quantity of them and that standardized quantity is what we call the mole. Okay?  The mole is the number of objects atoms molecules Etc equal to the number of atoms present in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. By the way. This definition has changed over the years. I'm not even sure what it is now, but basically it's a set number that number turns out to be Avogadro's Number shown down here on the bottom of this. So anytime we have 6.022 * 10 to the 23rd items.  We have a mole of that.  Again, you should have gone through the calculation of if you had a quarter mole of pennies.  How long will it take you to spend it at $50,000 a second and you should have come up with a very large number.  Here is a mole of various elements and you can see that a mole. That's huge number.  You look on here.  It's not a huge amount in most cases.  Okay.  So where we going to start with next time is the molar mass. Now as you start to do calculations for this lab, you're going to want to start looking at these slides. We will go through the molar mass. Most of you can count with a calculated. I will look at how we determine empirical formulas next time. Alright folks. I'll see you tomorrow be prepared. "
