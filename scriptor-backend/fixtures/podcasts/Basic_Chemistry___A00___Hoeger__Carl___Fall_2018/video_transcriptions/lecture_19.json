It's a bunch of things to talk about here today the first of all your volume metric lab reports to display most of you know that you got the eating you got the email or the the announcement on that again, the volumetric lab is one that is going to be more germane. You understand why you did it when you get into Kim 6p and succeed. It's one of these is one of the things that I've put in because most of the time when you get into if you've never done a titration when you get into Kim 6B or and succeed where they do already talked a lot about this and 7 hours. Well, you'll be confused as hell. Most of my chem for students will tell me after they've, you know been through the chemistry series. They'll tell me that yeah, they can't believe that people in 6B and 60 have no idea. What a titration is OAR in 7 L have no idea how to do lab work.  Quarter is how to do that stuff and this is a little bit. This is at this is this a little more advanced of a lab, then you would find in some other basic chemistry classes, but I think it's an important teaching lab to show you some of the analytical work that you'll have to do. The post lab questions are due Friday and lab again, the lab on Friday is essentially all you have to do on Friday.  Show up.  Turn in your your discussion and your post lab questions for the volumetric lab and turn in your Lewis structure worksheet. What you should be working on and you're done you can go home and they'll be some stuff to pick up 4 lb labs for you to pick up. We've been waiting on them for reasons that I can't get into my quiet down quiet down out of my class yet.  Thankfully, I'll never I'll say this you probably never see me again, which is good. I mean for some of you it'll be good.  Unless you take chem 60 during the summer which case you'll see me again.  Cuz I'm going to be doing organic from here till.  I'm doing a lot of questions and Lewis worksheet. Are you on Friday to beginning? What's your turn those in you can go again the kids want some stuff to pick up. You can talk to your ta ask him questions. What have you find out what class your ta next quarter? If you're teeing the class of your inner not that kind of stuff. It was a note on the nomenclature quiz, and it was on to the versions. I believe it was version 3 inversion for it was one mistake. Yeah.  No, you do not have to Dress for Less store close Okay, but you don't have to have your lab your lab your lab coat? Okay. Okay now by the way, you know how it feels today going to be colder on Friday. So not really too worried about you guys coming in and shorts, by the way, for those of you see those boxes around a safe or donate your lab coat if you're going to do any other labs UCSD don't donate your lab coat just keep it because you're going to need it and you're going to need it in 7 hours and there and actually biology is requiring them now because of they're just they're just more safety requirements as we go along.  You don't look like your quiz note is this there were two versions of the test in which there was a mistake on the key and it didn't get caught and degraded the greater, which wasn't your TA by the way, the greater went through and didn't catch them. If you're one of those people I posted the answers up by my office if there's a mistake on your quiz bring it into my office and I'll take care of it immediately. Like I said, there's only a couple is like two versions to this happened that this happened on and even then I think only it only affects a few people that's a two-point swing. It's a 2.62 points. That's about it on the final exam is Tuesday, December 11th at 8 a.m. And it's in the recreational gym. I'm going to show you where that is. You need to make sure that you were there and you made that the rec gym show up anywhere else and you fail this class.  . You're you're not going to eat. If you can't find where the final is then you can take the final we can take the final you fail because I don't give makeup finals. Okay now having said that the gym, let me tell you first of all the red gym is Big there's going to be and it is a gymnasium essentially what you going to have his tables about this size I think about this and maybe a little bit longer and I'll be three people at each table and the room will hold almost 400 people. So you're not going to be crowded. You're not going to be crowded or crammed in there. However, the the group of you've talked to me on or the group of you will have to sit in the front. We will save some space up there for you the rest of you as you come in, we'll just tell you where to sit and basically you'll be fed and roll at a time. It's a much different kind of seating arrangement in your used than you're used to it does have a  There's a lot of room there. You'll have plenty of room to work. You don't need to bring a Scantron. I will provide those I'll provide the scratch paper. I'll provide the exam. I'm going to talk about this on Thursday in little more detail in more detail the final exam. You leave the final exam. Are you when you finish your going to get up? You're going to leave your Scantron on top of your on top of or in your exam. You're going to get up either to leave your exam where you're sitting taking the test and then you're going to throw your scratch paper way. You're going to leave and the story you'll get to keep your finals if you don't get to see if you don't get the back, but you can look at them in the winter.  The recreational gym. We need you there between 7:30 and 7:40. It's basically it's just to get you see that your backpacks are going to go along with the walls. There's the two walls of the gym now, but I warn you.  Hey, no pencil sharpener in there. So make sure your pencils are sharpened be it's cold in there bring a sweatshirt. Okay, and you don't have to I mean if you don't mind freezing, it's fine, but it is cold in there. I will I will tell you that it also doesn't it doesn't it doesn't smell bad smells like rubber. Okay, because they have those mats down on the floor that you can also basketball hoops are down so you can shoot baskets if you want. Actually you can't but you can pretend you. Okay know where is the rec gym?  I'm the recreation gym, by the way, as you get in you're going to take more and more exams in the gym because for big classes we let they let us use it. So here we are at your call right down here. Okay. So if you go out there's Ravel quad you walk down this road. There's ureter Bonner. This here is Tata. I still think that is the strangest name I've ever heard. OK it also has connotations. I don't want to get into okay denotation. Sorry denotation, but that Tata Hall that's the new less the new building right next to it is the rec gymnasium. The problem is you can't see it because of these bushes or whatever the hell they are right there. Okay, what you'll do is you'll go down this path way. You'll come in right here the rec gym. Is this whole thing right here is or actually it's right over here. It's  You're going to be taking this morning to be taking the exam. So what you'll do, so it's not that far from where we are now. I wanted to make sure you saw this so, you know where we are. So you'll come basically down this way. There's a g in the main gym is there and then just to sort of tell you exact if you've known you've gone too far. Okay, there are the tennis courts and there's men Mandeville Center. So if you if you're if you're trying to find it and you see Sun God you're in the wrong place Sun God is right over here. So main gym rack the natatorium. By the way, the natatorium is a fancy name for swimming pool time.  All right, that's just to make sure that we've got that on the same that we're on the same page as far as that kind of stuff goes so good. We are on the same page.  All right.  next  cheat sheets are given are going to be given out on Thursday. If you don't come to class, you won't get a cheat sheet. I'll give them out in the beginning of the class and I'll give them out at the end of class. If you come early get one early if you have to run off to some other tests, but she cheats have been an issue as far as people not coming to class with a view. In fact, one of the big deals that came up. This quarter was the business about people not coming to class and people clicking in for them. I mean, I got it I got I got a I got a note from the people in an academic Integrity about this. We know what happens. We know that there are some idiots in this class will click in for other people. You're a fool if you do it.  I mean seriously, that's like someone coming up to you and say hey, would you rob a bank for me the way you should know something about academic Integrity? The rules academic Integrity is that there are two people in any academic and any academic Integrity violation there always two people that are charged the person who did it and the person who let it happen and that is an even if you didn't let it happen. I've known people who've been spent a lot of time finding it because of that so just don't do it. Now again, we know what happens and what have you and we also know the people who click in for other people don't click in on the correct answers for questions. We know that happens a lot too. So, please I need you over here on Thursday cuz I want to make sure everyone's on the same page as far as what's happening with respect to the final.  All right, let's do before I go back to any of the other things that I want to do. I want to come over and I want to do a question here.  And this is a question regarding Heat.  So if you put a cup of water that's at room temperature 25\u00b0 C by the way is called ambient temperature room temperature. It's not ambient in here today, but you put it into a freezer and in an hour, it's become ice. You have a really good freezer. Assuming the water is your system.  The process just occurred can be described as which of these.  puppies  The good news is in the cold weather. The Cockroaches don't come out.  By the way, this isn't that cold where I went to graduate school.  cold with 20 below  This kind of weather would be all almost. This would be almost sultry.  All right.  Let's finish this question up.  Put a cup of water in at 25\u00b0 C.  last chance  Rip's and we go last chance. All right.  The correct answer is it is exothermic k?  You have to think of the system in this case. What is the system its water?  When water freezes does heat leave the water or does heat go into the water has to be leaving the water.  When he leaves A system, that is an exothermic process. Now, you don't know when you first think of the reason I put this question up is because I want you to start thinking about these things in that kind of chirp. It doesn't you don't really think of water as giving off heat.  When you put it in the freezer, but it does in fact, did anybody know what the old name for a refrigerator used to be?  Or what or I let me put it this way the mechanism that the did you that they use to keep the freezer to keep the refrigerator cold is called a what?  Engineer should know this.  Go to heat pump.  Call the heat pump and AC pump is something that pumps heat out of the system. And that's what it's doing a refrigerator pumps heat out. That's why standing behind refrigerator. Usually pretty warm because it's pumping out of what's in the refrigerator or the freezer another a couple other terms on your endothermic. I think everybody knows.  But there's two other terms on here that I threw in just because they they look they look up official.  Sorry, that's Kim. That's the wrong question. That's that's that's the chem 40 question.  There we go.  Are we go okay?  The two terms are isothermal adiabatic in real terms, by the way, I so thermic.  Is a process where the temperature doesn't change?  Isothermic ISO meaning same thermic meaning heat. It's one where the temperature doesn't change. So in essence an isothermic process is one where the heat doesn't exchange going on in room temperature change. Okay, I think that back  There can you learn more about this in 62 candy heat exchange, but it means that the temperature is constant isothermic me to temperature constant adiabatic is the one term across at 6. Like I have to take a step back and try to remember what adiabatic is a process is a process.  where no  all energy is excuse me for all energy is transferred.  Through work and not heat and it's it's a it's hard to explain. I'm going to leave it. I'm going to leave it at that. The realtor Matt V is a type of a type of a process.  But you'll learn about more in chemistry in chemistry 6B. So I just want to make sure that you I just wanted to put that up there and we won't talk about it anything past them anything cast what we've just done so let's go back over to this and finish up this discussion of inner module and we can get the last one we talked about is doing heat capacity from specific finding quantity of heat from specific heat capacity.  you could also use this to calculate the heat capacity how to calculate for example the heat capacity of a house for example in or so if for example I knew  What the chain with the heat exchanger the heat was spy knew what the heat that was lost or gained was and if I knew what the mass and the temperature change was I could solve this for the heat capacity again. Remember that what we're doing here is we're using this equation here. So if you're given the change in temperature of the mass and the heat, you can calculate the heat capacity capacity is something that you want to know about certain materials, especially in in engineering kind of application to wonder what the heat capacity of certain materials. Are they hold on to heat or whether they dissipate the heat. I'm obviously if you want to stay warm you going to want to you want to have something that holds onto the Heat  And if you want to cool off you want something is going to let the heat Escape faster. How do we measure these things what the way we measure heat? There's actually two ways to do this. The most common is to use something called a coffee cup calorimeter something I believed you when you were measuring the the heat on limiting reactant is limiting reactant or coffee. They're cold coffee cup calorimeter because duh that use coffee cups that use good old coffee cups. Now, we're in this Greenland where we can't use polystyrene anymore, but the old coffee cups were made out of polystyrene and polystyrene.  The plastic grande police siren doesn't break down but one of the one of the nice things about them is that they kept things warm. They don't they they basically kept things hot. So these coffee cups. They call them coffee cup calorimeter what they really are are styrofoam cups. And what we do is we would put two styrofoam cups into one another the outer styrofoam cups. Cop does nothing more than insulate the inner one from the surroundings. Basically, what you do is you put your sample in there and you let it do whatever is going to do you let it do the chemical reaction or whatever and then you measure the temperature used to measure the temperature before anything starts and then you measure the temperature at the very end and then using this you can calculate the heat of reaction gives off. So, for example, you could take a sample like a chunk of metal. That was hot throw it in here.  If you know what the temperature of the metal was the temperature the metal was you can throw it in there and measure the amount of heat that it gives off. You could figure heat capacity that this kind of way. I'm coffee cup calorimeter measures are used for measuring specifically measuring heat measure heat is given off from that. You can get all kinds of other kinds all kinds of other information. There's a second kind of calorimeter that I believe I'm not going to show you caught a bomb calorimeter used for measuring usually combustion reactions in a cold bomb calorimeter cuz they are kind of like a bomb.  A measuring using a calorimeter again in this so a a 275 gram sample of nickel at 103 C is placed in a hundred miles of Water by the way people have asked in the past. How do I know that the nickel is 100 degrees C. There's a rule there is a law of thermodynamics called a zero with law the zero with a Zen Zero two objects when putting contact wanted with one another will eventually reach the same temperature two objects at different temperatures when put together will eventually reach the same temperature Nichols to be a hundred degrees C is what in boiling water because water boils at a hundred degrees C so we know that if that nickel has been in the boy.  Water we take it out stick it right in our vessel. We know that nickel will be at a hundred degrees C. That's one of the ways that that's 100\u00b0 gets used so much. I'm if you place it in a hundred miles of water at 22 degrees C. The final temperature of the system is determined to be 39.6 degrees C. Given the heat capacity of water is 4.18 joules per gram Kelvin, assuming no heat is lost or gained from the surroundings and water is so dense city of 1 grams per milliliter calculate the heat capacity of nickel and I'm going to let you do this when I'm going to actually put the answer up when when I want to post a slide this weekend. Let me give you a hint on let me give you a way to do this in a problem. Like this is what we're going to say. Is that the Q.  That is lost by the hot body.  Will be equal.  to the Q  gained  by the cold body now in essence is really says we need to put a minus sign in here because he lost is minus. Okay know if we then put this in two terms that we're used to seeing we say that the queue of the nickel.  Will be equal.  to the mass of the nickel  time specific heat capacity of the nickel  times-delta  for the nickel and again delta T is final minus initial that number is going to be negative.  Number could be negative because of this.  For the water. This is the hot body was the hot body.  For the water to of a water is equal to the mass of the water. Would you could determine from the milliliters in the density times specific heat capacity for water?  Time to change in temperature for the water. This is the cold body.  And the part of this that you need to remember.  Is the T final?  Will be the same.  for both  that's what the zero with law of thermodynamics said that when you the tube that the the both of water in the nickel once they reach thermal equilibrium in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is where she's not being transferred anymore. Once you reach thermal equilibrium both the water and the nickel will be at the same temperature. I'd like you to try this on your own.  Just put the answer up so you can see what it is.  The first law of thermodynamics and I put this slide in here to sort of like give you this this this final piece of information about what we're told we all we been talkin about the first law of thermodynamics internal energy of a the internal energy of Any Given system. The change in internal energy is a function of the heat that system either gives off herbs and the work that it either does or has done on it a system that's isolated system that has no contact.  with surroundings  contact with the surroundings that idea of a perfect thermos. For example, when you have a system like that the change in the internal energy is zero, which is what the real life first law. Thermodynamics says the first law of thermodynamics says the real internal energy of an isolated system is constant now again, you'll see bear you'll see a lot of different definitions for this. They all say the same thing energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The internal energy of an isolated system is constant the change in internal energy is equal to the heat. Plus. These are our different ways of stating the same thing. And this is the law meaning that we can use this to do a lot of kinds of calculations lot of understanding of what's happening in process. He's because it is Allah we don't need  It is a lot synopsis. Something's been observed over and over again. Now the last two things on here both q and W or path-dependent and he has not passed depended. Those are things that I'm just I put their this is a slide from Kim's 6p and it's say I put those up here.  Change in internal energy is is not path-dependent and it's something that's not past. The pin is called a state function a state function only.  The value for a state function is only dependent on where you start and where you end.  Okay.  So if you think about it like this the way I explain this m6p is like this. Let's say you want to take a trip to Boston from San Diego to Boston to go from San Diego to Boston. You could take a plane.  They can train you can drive you can walk.  Okay, you could ride piggyback on your friend. You can drive you can take a horse. Okay, you could go north.  Up to Montana or up to warm up the Washington, Oregon and go across the US that way you could go diagonal across the us or you could go the southern route and then come up the eastern coast.  All of those are different paths.  Each path each path has a different energy associated with it. However  If you look at the basic as the what's going on you start in San Diego you end in Boston. It doesn't matter how you get from point A San Diego to point B.  And so when you get in the chemistry 6B, they're going to talk about path-dependent and path independent processes.  The important thing to remember is that a state function does not require that you define the path by how you get there.  It doesn't require that you define the path only tells you.  Where you start and where you stop sucking fighting a friend over to your house, you don't care how they get there.  You don't tell them O come over to my house on Saturday, but you must go up Broadway make a right turn on Easy Street know you just say come to my house. You don't care how they get there. So that's a state function.  Wherever you are get to my house a path dependent function would be if you told them come to my house, but there's only way that I want you to go is this way than this way this way this way that's a different story. And again, I'll talk more about this in chemistry 6 p.m. 6 see the path functions are relatively important.  More energy than I usually do something. I wanted to make sure that you'd seen because energy is one of those things that's going to be a big deal as we go along. So let's finish up the corner by talking of some of you started to look at this material already the sum of its going to be some of its going to Simply Be a rehash of what I said, but let's talk about bonding and Lewis structure now, I  I have to say this.  This is a topic you are going to talk about it in in chem 6A. Okay, and you're going to talk about it after you talk about quantum mechanics. You're going to talk about this after you talk about electrons and about electronic structure of atom about the electronic structure of molecules.  Bonding is another one of those kinds of things that we take for granted until we need to use it.  If you understand Bond strengths if you wander stand polarity if you understand something called electronegativity, you can make predictions about what will happen.  When two molecules are put in contact with one another a lot of people in the 6 series and in Kim they need this do I get to organic till they find out that their organic instructors are using these theories over and over again. If you learn it, you won't have a problem. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about.  Everything you've learned first of all what kind of chemist am I to tell you?  What do I get my degree in Organic Chemistry by organic chemistry. I know a buttload about biology and chemistry especially organic.  When I teach any class.  I always teach it with an eye toward biochemistry biology and organic chemistry. Meaning I know those are where most of you have to go most of you were going to need to know that stuff. So I spend more time focusing on that. And so when I tell you that these principles are going to be important they are now, is it important that you understand the now no,  You need to have a general idea of them being able to do very simple things, but you'll see it again. And as you start to see it, you'll start to get more and more involved in understanding if there's one topic and Lewis structure called resonance.  That will haunt you.  Throughout the entire 40 series if you don't understand it.  Do I expect you to understand it here? No.  I expect you to go. Yeah, that's something I've heard. And I know why it's important, but they don't really understand. We'll talk about it just a little bit. So to be able to talk about Bonnie we have to brief foray into the world of quantum mechanics. We're only going to do a quick overview hear the deeper look will be afforded you in six a much deeper than most of you want to really want to do the canex is one of those things that when I teach it I tell my students just put reality on hold while you're learning this  Because it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Ionic bonding is somewhat simple. That's the very that's the one that we're going to spend the least time on you most likely already had a handle on it. It's all cool. Ombac plus charges interact with - churches and the story of drugs are Pharmaceuticals of proteins. It is how things are held together. It's how carbon holds other carbons to itself and hydrogen's and oxygens covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron. It is not an electrostatic. It is not as it is not a purely electrostatic that's a plus charger. The mine is charged a coulomb interaction. It's a sharing of electrons in the sharing of electrons is something that maybe on the surface doesn't make a lot of sense.  Especially when you start understand when you realize that it's uneven sharing in most cases really bonding is not.  We're going to share these electrons. Okay, that's part of it. Okay, it's more complicated than ionic bonding. But the good news is we were able to use similar concept the idea of uneven sharing is something that I mean look,  married for 38 years, so  I know what you were in relationships understand this idea of it on TV sharing, okay.  Guys in interleague guys, always like to say, I'm the boss.  Okay.  There's always one person in a relationship who says.  What I really wish you would which is another way of saying you better. Okay. It's an uneven amount of sharing I think about this. I have a router at home.  Okay, does my wife evenly share my router no.  Okay.  We have a bathroom at home. No.  I messed it up too much. I'm going to hear about it. So she has more more power there than I do.  There are certain things that be in a relationship there certain things where it is. Not an even a 50/50. That's what you have to understand in bonding many bonds in molecules are not shared evenly that makes those bonds what we call polar.  Where one atom has more control over the shared electrons in another one and this is important that shared electrons are still shared even if one of the two atoms controls the more than the other so what are the components that make up an atom?  First thing that makes up an atom are the protons they are they determine the identity of the element and a reflected in the atomic number of that element. So for example of stuff that we talked about before so for example  carbon  has a z equal to 6. Therefore it has six.  Protons the protons are in the nucleus.  k  neutrons  Which we call N I use and 0 neutrons are.  They're essentially help keep the nucleus together.  They have a rule in the stability of a particular isotope of an element. They are present in the nucleus and they buffer somehow.  The positive charge but the interesting thing about this is that you can't have an unlimited number of Duke of neutron. There are certain amount of neutrons for any given element.  It are required any more or any less causes the nucleus to be unstable again.  So for example, if I had carbon 12 carbon 12 has 6 protons and the remainder are 6 neutrons again, these are found in the nucleus.  Tell again something you learned later on in the 6-series. Is that depending on the number of neutrons? You can determine whether an isotope is going to be stable or not radioactive or not. Okay.  protons and neutrons protons and neutrons as  are what we call.  nucleons  nucleons are found in the nucleus the electrons on the other hand are what are found outside of the nucleus?  The electrons occupy the large space that's found outside of that. They are water involved in the bonding of elements to one another the electrons in a neutral atom are equal to the number of protons that neutral atom has so that neutral carbon for example  Has six electrons because it also has six protons six protons.  carbon plus 2  has four electrons  again carbon is has 6 protons. The only way it could be plus two is if it has two less electrons irons come from the loss of electrons are the electrons are involved in bonding, but not all electrons not all electrons are involved in bonding k a neutral atom will have as many electrons as protons. That's just what I said A cation laugh fewer electrons than protons. So here for example, if I go to sodium  Sodium is atomic. Number 11 sodium has Z is equal to 11.  They are for neutral.  sodium  has 11 electrons.  sodium + 1  has one less electron.  Therefore it has 10 electrons an anion something like sulfur. Mine is to  has two more  electrons  10 neutral sulfur neutral sulfur has 16  Okay, quantum mechanics tells us to the electrons live in orbitals.  And the electrons in different orbitals have different rules and different properties from a bonding perspective. Now, I used I put the term live in quotes because that's not an it's it's it's as close as an analogy close to the word analogies. I can use electrons are found in certain regions of space these regions of space are what are known as orbitals.  it doesn't mean  the the electron  is not doesn't mean the electron can't be anywhere. It just means that it tends to spend more time.  mirror  or in certain regions of space rather than in others.  That's what an orbital is an orbital is what's known as a probability distribution.  It is the probability of finding an electron in the given locations of quantum mechanics is all about regardless of any of that.  The orbitals in a the orbitals in a atom for example here is one set of orbital's known as s s orbitals the S stands for spiracle.  Depending on whether there are they it's a One S A 2s or 3s. The electrons can be found at different distances.  From the nucleus the nucleus being right in the middle here, okay.  Oops, I'm come on you are we go the nucleus is found right in the middle here.  Turns out in this thing. For example, something like 3s. This first number here is what's known as the principal.  quantum number  in the principal quantum number is easily is easiest to be described as a level.  Correspond roughly to the periods in the periodic table the rows of the periodic table again. You'll learn the real story about that.  What you need to understand about principal quantum number is as that number gets bigger. The electrons are further and further from the nucleus.  Any orbital as a result is bigger and bigger so that a 3s orbital is bigger than a 1s or 2s. It look it has the same general shape, but it's bigger.  They're also things known as P orbitals.  Kind of look like now the the the ones that I've shown up on the top of PX py pz by the way one orbital 2px is the line on the x-axis py on the y-axis Peezy on the z-axis.  They look really more like that thing. I've shown doubt the bottom. Okay, they sort of look like a dumbbell almost, okay.  Again, these are orbitals. You can find the electron notice. It looks different than an s or all of a sudden you see a plus sign in a minus sign the plus sign and the minus sign are not charges.  They are whether you are above or below the Axis or the plane is defined by that orbital. It's a mathematical sign used in quantum mechanics.  A lot of times instead of using the Plus in the minus for example to keep kids from getting too confused about this. We shade the orbitals will shade one low and this by the way is what's called a lobe.  Bad here with shade one lobe a different color than the other to indicate. That one is got one mathematical sign. When has the other mathematical son out this point in time. That doesn't make much sense to you understand that the sign tells us about whether orbitals can combine or not. The sign does nothing more than tell us about whether orbitals can combine or not again a quantum-mechanical thing.  D orbitals look like this noticed your boobs are starting to look more and more complicated as we start to go up. So we seen S P & D orbitals K900 and then there's the F4 battles.  BF stands for fundamental they'll look fundamental to me. Okay.  Let's do this.  There is only in any given.  Principal quantum number there's one s orbital in any principal quantum number. There are three p orbitals in a principal quantum number. There are five deorbit in any principal quantum number there are  7 F orbitals K. Why does this determine? How does it show itself in the periodic table?  How many columns are here?  2 if each orbital can hold two electrons, then the S orbital  can hold two electrons is only one s. Okay. So this is what we call over here. This is what's known as the BS.  Block, okay.  If we go over here.  I noticed I'm leaving helium and hydrogen out there's a reason for that that you learn about him. There are six there are six elements in that block. There are three p orbitals each p orbital holds two electrons there for you can have a total of six elements with electron. So this is what's known as VP.  block  what's known as the p?  block  In the center of all of this.  And you notice there's some this periodic table has some missing. There are 10 elements across again. There are five D orbitals, which means two electrons per orbital means you can have a total of 10 of those. So this is what's known as the D-Block.  And I'm finally if we go down below.  Very bottom of this thing the ones that are separated out there are 14 of these there are seven F orbitals and therefore 7 * 2 is 14. So these are what are known as the F block elements.  don't the reason I'm bringing this up is this  depending on whether you're an S block element P block element D-Block element or an F block element. You have different chemistry's  And the chemistry's are really defined.  By your orbitals, but not by all of your orbitals.  Your chemistry is really defined by the orbitals that are out.  the farthest  so we'll see this in a minute. There are two types. There are basically two sets of electrons. They're what are called inner electrons and what are called outer electrons.  Inner electrons are never involved in bonding.  Are water called electrons in outer electron inner electrons are never involved in bonding.  outer electrons  are the ones that are responsible for the chemistry and or the bonding, but there's two but there is a subclass of outer electrons called valence electrons.  valence electrons that on the board  Are the electrons that are responsible for bonding?  Okay. Now the thing about valence electrons, is it valence electrons?  Only s in the P outer electrons.  Only the s in the P anything else a d or an F is can be an outer electron and I'll show you how to figure the outers out here in a minute.  outer electron  but not a valence electron. So let's look for example on our periodic table. Let's look and see.  Let's take a look take a look at kicking element selenium.  So, how do we know?  How many electrons selenium have well that's easy selenium has 34 electrons because it has the same number of electrons as it does protons, but how many of those inner and how many of those are outer that's actually easy as well. So let me go up here again and put down.  I made you this up here selenium.  has  34 electrons. Okay. Now, how do I know which ones are inner and outer wheel? That's easy. What I do is I work my way back.  From where is selenium is in the periodic table. I work my way back until I get to the first noble gas going backwards.  k  that marks the end of the inner electrons for the element that I'm looking at. So what you do is go backwards until you find.  The noble gas the first noble gas you come to that noble gas represents. The number of electrons that are inner electron. So of this argon has 18 I circled the 8 so therefore for selenium k  18 electrons  inner  Okay.  and if I count across this  Okay. I have one to 12 13 14 15 16 16 electrons.  router  k  so the 16 inner electrons are electrons have no part in bonding have no part in the chemistry there really keep the electronic balance. It's the 18 or the 16 outer electrons, but all of these 16 outer electrons,  Hey, turn off your your phone.  Okay. Tell your mom your call her back.  I'll be sixteen outer electrons in k.  2  rtasks  Rd  1 2 3 4  are P electrons?  bear 44566  Are valence because the six valence electrons are the S&P the Deezer on valence electrons.  Kay Lewis structure  we need to know be able to do Lewis structure. We need to know how many valence electrons something has to be able to do Lewis structure cuz we're not for any of the elements in the D Block. You need to know how many valence electrons there are valence electrons are a subset of the outer electrons to do this.  And that's the simply look at the group number.  The group number is 6  That also tells me how many valence electrons something in that group has by the way. This only works for the main group elements for the S and the P blocks.  If you look at that and tell you how many electrons are present are in that are in the valence. Shell. We need that number as we're going to get to Lewis structure here.  How are ions formed ions are formed and again, this is a very simple ions are formed by electrons being transferred from a cation or from sorry from one element to another.  Spell this is iron formation. This is not covalent bond.  Any iron formation?  All you're doing is taking electrons from something that wants to give up electrons and giving them to something that wants to take them another words one atom.  Becomes a cation the other atom becomes an anion.  One atom becomes a cation the other becomes an anion. Can you like 3 weeks of this next quarter or two weeks of this next quarter?  And I guarantee you.  You understand what I'm saying now?  You'll understand the more difficult when it gets more difficult.  How do we describe coulomb ionic bonds? We use Coulomb's law and an Essence all Coulomb's law that says is this the force of attraction between a cation and anion?  is directly proportional  to the product of their charges divided by the distance between the cation and the anion.  That's for the coulomb force.  The force between in an ionic bond is the function is directly proportional to the product.  All of the charges of the cation and anion / the distance between them.  So for example, if you have a plus-2 and mine is to Ian.  And they are.  15 angstroms apart  The coulomb force would be + 2 x - 2 / the distance between them 15-inch from now. There are some other quantities in here. You'll actually see this at 2:31 add a juul picometers. You'll see that equation in chemistry 6A in essence. All this means is this ionic bonds gets stronger as the charges go up.  And it gets stronger as the distance get shorter.  Another way to look at this. Is it ionic bond get weaker?  As the distance between the two irons gets larger.  Which means that long Bonds in general whether they are covalent or ionic bonds are weaker than short bonds.  The further the distance between two elements in the periodic table weaker. The bond will be whether it's covalent or ionic.  are all electrons equal this is what I was talking about a moment ago is that they aren't there are in ER  inner shell and outer shell electrons a lot of this information. We got out of studying the noble gases which are inert.  So it's only the Adams at the outermost periphery. They're really involved in the bonding process. Again, this is using 10 here to talk about this idea of core electrons. The inner electrons in the outer shell in the valence electrons is the other the other kind of thing electrons are strictly not considered to be valence electrons. Although sometimes you call the Dell say there in the valence shell responsible for the chemistry, but they're not really responsible for the bombing at least as far as you know changes when you start looking at bonding in metals in chem sixe, but I'm going to leave that as a topic for your cem60 instructor.  Or me if you have meme.  What are pictorial representations how do we represent this?  Well from a bonding standpoint, bonding standpoint. We don't need to show all of the electrons when we're talkin about bonding really only interested in the valence electrons. And in fact, that's really the most the ones that were the most interested in any way. So for example, if we look at 10:10.  How would we write how do we represent 10 in this case? Well  We say that here is our element tin.  But if we want to show somebody only the valence electrons.  What we do is we look at the strap we look at it. And we seeing if Tanner has four valence electrons. So the way we put those in is by writing our element and putting them around.  the 10 adults  This is what's known as a Lewis Dot Structure the dots represent electrons.  no sheer  They represent hear the representing only the valence electrons once we start bonding.  the other elements  the dots are going to represent the elements the electrons that are shared.  But again, we're dealing only with the valence electrons. We're not dealing with the outer with all of the outer or any of the core electrons.  So how do we represent covalent structures K12? We look at these three here.  hydrogen  H2 has two electrons that are shared between the two hydrogen's we would represent this.  Instead of using the dots we would simply do this. But or sorry I put a flooring in your ass thinking ahead here would simply do this. Okay, if we look at scary.  each flooring  you look at the periodic table. Each fluorine has seven electrons around it.  There are two chlorines in F2.  So when you put them together.  What you get is this?  Or represent it like this.  the line indicates  bonded electrons  the dots are what are called unknown.  bonded  Electrons which when found in pairs are called lone pairs.  Lone pairs are electrons pairs of electrons that are not bonded.  They are on a given atom because they're required to be there there in the valence shell, but they're not bonding with anything.  Don't get it in your head that unbonded or lone pairs of electrons aren't important because they are that leaves us now to HF. What is h f look like a Jeff has a hydrogen with its one electron.  Bonding to a fluorine nobody use X's here.  So we can see what comes from what?  bonding together  to give this  which is more often written.  By the way, I'm just using access instead of dots you would normally do this. To show you what it what it looks like. Okay?  So what's going on?  In this covalent bonding. This is just a picture. This is just an energy representation of the bonding.  Two atoms like two hydrogen's or a hydrogen and fluorine are far away from one another they're not interacting but as they get closer and closer the electrons in the valence shell call start to interact with one another as they interact with one another they start to form a bond at some point in time.  They are at a location.  Where are the attraction between them is at a maximum?  And therefore I said a minimum energy and the repulsion between the two atoms is at a minimum. This is what's known as the bonding distance. So what happens is two atoms come together until they're at the right just at the right distance from one another they interact with one another at that point.  Maximally make a bond.  Okay.  Depending on what the two atoms are that Bond distance that Bond links will vary.  But it always represents an energy low on energy Minima. This is why bonding occurs bonding occurs because the two atoms bonded to one another are lower in energy.  Then either Adam is by itself.  I'm glad you think this is funny that you  another nice thing about Kim 6/8 offer every quarter.  Scamp or is it?  What does the distribution of electrons look like from a map standpoint? That's it. Okay, what is this map look like it shows you attractions and repulsions essentially what it says is this these are called electric. These are called electric static Maps electric potential Maps. The bottom line is it says this most of the electron density is found between the two atoms. That's what bonding is all about electrons and electron density being found between two atoms.  Nhfh to hif 2 + HF. Why is the F bigger than the age because of those lone pairs of electrons, but notice HF itself most of the electron density. That's what this is showing. Most of the electron density is found on the fluorine.  Most of the electron density is found on the flooring.  And what this really means is that there is an uneven distribution of electron density in HF. Most of the electron density is found on the flooring. This leads us to the idea of polarity.  We also have to introduce a new topic when we're talking about covalent bonds and at new topic is electronegativity and electronegativity.  Gold Spike dress different definitions, but it says essentially the same thing electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to polarize electrons in a bond when attached to another atom must be bonded to another atom for this definition to apply.  Once two atoms are bonded to one another unless they are the same atom of carbon bonded to a carbon.  One of the two atoms in the pair is going to exert more of an influence on the electrons in that Bond than the other K. That's what this is all about. That is polarity when one atom is more electronegative than another.  When one atom has more of a tendency to control the electrons in the bond in the other we have what is known as a polar bond.  electronegativity in the periodic table you can see here increases  As we go up it increases as we go from left to right which means the general trend.  It's from the bottom left-hand Corner the top right-hand corner.  The bigger the debt the difference in electronegativity between two atoms.  the more polar the bond  also  the difference between electronegativity between the atoms the bigger the difference the more likely the bond is to be ionic and covalent.  So we can say one thing in general.  Two atoms that are close to one another in the periodic table form covalent bonds with one another.  Two atoms that are further apart in the periodic table tend to form ionic bonds.  So sodium and fluorine will form.  And ionic bond. Wow carbon and fluorine, cuz their clothes are in the periodic table will form a covalent bond.  Doubt just to muddy the water up.  There is no such thing as a pure ionic nor a pure covalent bond.  Bonds are mixtures of covalent and ionic City.  when the amount of ionic character is bigger than a covalent character the bonds ionic or considered to be ionic when the covalent character is bigger than a lot of character is considered to be  Covalent. All right. Now before I let you go last thing the next few slides on here drawing Lewis structures. I want you guys to read through these  And print them out and what I really like you to do is to print this one out because what we're going to do next time is we're going to start with the next slide.  I'm ready to go through drawing Lewis structures by actually drawing some Lewis structures memory turn your reports and I'll see you guys all on Thursday. "
