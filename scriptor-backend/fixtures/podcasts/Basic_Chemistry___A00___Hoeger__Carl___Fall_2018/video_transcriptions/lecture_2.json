  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started.  So I'm clicking using the letter B today. I see 297 of you have done this.  This is one of my pet peeves are these the people who come in and put this crap on the board and then they figure that like well double it up and so I watch them put it up and then I'll come and erase it.  I could do that. But why would I this is more fun? Actually, what they do is they take a picture of it and then they send it to their relative. Whoever told him to do it and then that way they can credit for putting it on the board and I just erased it.  It's a board. It's not a freaking an ad.  It's like having an attitude game today.  Let's go over to the BGA.  Again, everyone let Linda sorry it was late today at a meeting. So I wanted to make sure that that took a little bit more time than I expected. So your tears by the way, so I supposed to announce Miss really quickly and we'll start doing some work. First of all safety quiz. Remember you do need to take that by Friday morning and I would recommend that you start seriously thinking about taking it a number of you have already and it passed it already. I recommend that you start thinking about taking it Wednesday starting either tonight or Wednesday because if the load gets too big everybody tries to take it at the last minute.  Things that I've seen people get dumped out because of that and that's still a fail. Okay. So you do need to make sure that you do the safety quiz, most people taking it it can tell you it's not that hard if you want me to safety materials pretty straightforward actually and its way for me to know that yeah, you did actually read the safety material at least if you didn't understand it at least you, you know, we're smart enough to look it up the  There are a couple questions on a safety quiz 1 that say things like what is your name and stuff like that there they don't there's no points for those so you don't need to worry about them, but you do it but for some reason people have said why did it but it did show me the answer. I think I would set up not to show you your answer but it doesn't really matter. What matters are the questions, you know, what is an MSDS things like that. Also once you click that safety link,  That quiz link you got to take it because if you dump out at that point time, it gives you a 0 and it says oh you've taken it already.  And if you do and I have to reset if I have to reset your safety quiz for any reason you forfeit any chance at those five bonus points and you're already at least two people in a forfeited those points because of all I know I know I would take it won't you click the link dope? I like until I want to be when you click the link. Come on if nothing nothing that you do.  I can't backtrack you sing with mastering chemistry. Somebody told me one time I did I did work in a ditch didn't record it and then I went up on mastering chemistry told the person had never signed in. Well, who am I going to believe all I'm going to believe mastering chemistry. Now, the bottom line is this doesn't happen very often and it's freshman or freshmen. They try to get away with things. There's not much I can do about it. But to take the safety quiz now if you fail the safety quiz, I can drop you from the class now will I is another story if you fail the safety quiz, you will get an email from me some time on Friday. Just if you even if you fail the safety quiz go to lab on Friday.  You will get on that you'll get an email from me sometime later on Friday telling you you failed a quiz in this is what you're going to have to do if you want to stay in the class.  And usually it involves a lot of groveling and cash. So keep that in mind, please. I mean just kidding, but make sure you drop a class. Now. Remember you have lab this Friday. I'm going to come back to the math package in a minute. Make sure that you dress appropriately and so the phone that I'm telling the Tas and HTA will go through this again. The rule of thumb is going to be that  Are you listening to me? Are you listening to okay, I'm cool. Alright, see I'm online to the rule of thumb is this?  With your lab coat on in your lab coat needs to come down to your wrists. And usually they come down to help out there. Okay, I'll just above the knee sometimes below the knee and if you're really short Sometimes they come down really low. The rule of thumb is I don't want to see any skin.  From your shoulders really formal out there came from collarbone to the floor. Okay now with the lab coat on if you can you stand up for a minute. She's not take a note. So it doesn't matter turn around with the lab coat on it's going to cover like this. It's okay to have  it's going to cover like that. So it's okay to have a little skin right there. Okay, but below that nothing thank you very much. You're not there blow that no skin. That means socks. That means shoes that have tops wear tennis shoes that kind of stuff.  What I'm going to suggest to you is the following if you're not sure that your outfit is going to cut mustard.  It's going to be okay pack a pair of sweatpants.  And a + or a sweatshirt or the sweatshirts not usually an issue just in case sweatpants are always acceptable as far as I'm concerned. The only thing we don't want or spray on pants. Okay. Those are the kind of things that are what you want is a barrier between your skin and your clothes.  NBA are barriers the best one so I told people this if you can pinch your jeans and let it go and it snaps back to your skin. Probably too tight. Okay, I mean for lap, okay. No, we're not going to throw you out because of jeans usually butt leggings. We will ask you lie shorts. Absolutely. You'll be thrown out for wearing shorts. If your shoes don't net don't meet muster another words, if they don't they're not like tennis shoes or like shoes like this that have a top  They have some protection then you're going to be asked to leave and once you are asked to leave.  You got a zero for that way. If you can't come back no change and Leah ta will say well, where do you live and you live in revealing? If you run sometimes I'll let you get back in the lab. But I would tell you that I would not count on it. Make sure you come correct. The first lab is always the worst to the first lab is always the worst now, I expect you all to have lab coats for Friday, but I know some of you won't so the TA is are the TA will allow you as long as you are dressed correctly.  To do the lab on this Friday without a lab coat if you don't have it yet, but the following Friday next week. You have to have a lab coat or you do not or you cannot do the. And after that lab coats are required unless we tell you otherwise  Que se dese a big deal. I sent that EA's this long thing about safety and what they can do and what they have to do and the bottom line is they they have to enforce safety. And so and this is the last thing I'm going to mention it on Thursday about about correct dress and that'll be it from then on it's penalty time the math package spent the math package is not  do  it's not due until next week.  It is not do this weekend. It's not to Friday. It is not through Thursday. It is not due until next week.  And the math package is that thing that you saw that has for example?  It has you calculate counting significant figures and doing math thing. However, what you turn in and I forgot to print it out this morning. I will print it out to show you what you turn in is these Pages it just we're just asks you for answers to certain problems and it just want the answers and cut a couple places. You have to show the work and I think it wants your graps. But again that's in the back in that package you bought from the bookstore. You do need to get that somebody asked me do I do I need to make copies of everything that I turn in or do I need to do I need to have a copy for myself my answer to that is  It's always a good idea because it takes time to get braiding back that you make up that you make of Xerox copy of it. You don't have to take a picture on your phone or whatever just so you have a record for yourself. Now your record somebody will come and say to me how I turned it in here. Here's a picture of it. Okay, I believe that as much as I believe a picture of an alien eating breakfast with you that is little thing called Photoshop could do almost anything you want. Trust me. I done it before so I know but I want you to have a copy of it. So you have something to study from if you so if you so desire, do you have to make a copy of everything to turn in? No, but if you understand her sometimes it might not be might be 2 weeks before you get an experiment back graded because there is so many people in this class 2 grade. It can be an issue. So what is do this?  Friday only thing do this Friday  Is the pre lab for this experiment? Okay, so what's do this Friday?  The pre lab when you walk in the door.  Very first experiment is the easiest experiment of all make sure you've done the pre lab. If you don't have the pre lab you will be asked to leave the lap. Okay, that's always going to be the case. That is the one thing do this week and it's due on Friday starting next week. I will put up a list of what is due and when it's due.  okay something I forgot to put on here and that is this is something I I was going to do it before but  I'm not.  Yes.  Know the pre lab is in that package box in the bookstore.  The package you have from the bookstore has everything your tranny thing you turn in is in that packet from the bookstore. So make sure you have it.  Okay lab room assignments. They have not been made for you yet that's going to happen tonight. The reason is there are still people coming in and out of this class now, I think after today it should have settled down. So I'll be able to distribute students where they are.  I am going to put in your grade book on Ted on Triton that I'm going to put what lab room you're in for. Most of you. You're going to be in exactly the same what lab room that you think you already in but I am going to have to move some people around to distribute it to all the tears have the same number of students. So, please look at that on Friday when you show up at the lab. There will be posted on the door.  Who was in that lab in the a.m. Who's in that lab in the p.m. And if you can't find your name just ask a TA look you up and I'll tell you what room you're in. It should be on your Triton Ed Gradebook. And you all know you were a great book is right. That's how you can figure out what you got on that. That's how you can figure out what's going on a safety test. Okay, get used to using that it's over and it's over on the in the navigation bar on the left hand side. It says my grade book of Kim for Gradebook, okay?  I'm keep up with the homework. I can't emphasize that enough that I will emphasize that for the first couple weeks. And then after that, I'll stop telling you that I just assume you're doing it podcast. I'm sorry the podcast did not get up until last night because they forgot to tell me that they changed a procedure.  And I had to okay the podcast to be posted that's never happened in 15 years on the original podcasters 15 years. It's never happened or 12 or whatever all of a sudden they change the rules and forgot to tell me so both Kim 48th and Kim for your podcaster now up and they should always be up within an hour of the class being over and I will check that today to be sure if and I apologize to all of you who I sent emails to Saint you broadcast. I didn't know it was enough. Okay, if you're ever not sure of something check the podcast and don't send me an email and say I couldn't make class. Can you give me a recap of what you talked about today?  K I have  one thing to say to you know  All right.  Podcasts about now there's something else. It's Virtual Office hours at your Tia's have office hours. There was something I'm going to try this quarter. I have not. I've never done it with the new system I used to do. What were called Virtual Office hours. In other words. I would be at home usually late on a on a Saturday or Sunday Sometimes Late on Friday and I would have online office hours were actually you could talk to me. In fact, you could talk in a group. It's like having it's like being in a room like this where you're asking me questions and I'm answering and you can come and sit and you can come and listen to this. We're going to try it you going to use something called Zoom now when this is going to start I'm not sure it's going to be through Titan. Add your Ted page once I get everything set up, but I know what I'm going to do. I'll let you know keep that in mind or will be I expect some time by week 3 there will be a virtual office hours.  Sometime on the weekend where you can just basically asked questions you can come and listen to what questions people have. Not sure how it's going to work will work it out a used to use the program called collaborate on Ted that gave me white boards people would ask questions. It was a great thing will give that a try and we'll see how that works. Okay, if you haven't clicked in please make sure you do and let's now talk about some real Campground. Chemistry. Let's talk about math for most of you.  You find this stuff to be the boringest bore of boars K and I understand that but we have to make sure that you're on the same page. I will Cantell you this from years of experience most students in chemistry don't have problems with the chemistry as much as they had trouble with the math and it's mostly because you guys can catch can integrate the snot out of anything.  But you can't do Algebra 2 save your life. Okay?  And what do you think we use more of in this class algebra science is mostly algebra.  Calculus is how we get to the point where we can do the algebra. So unfortunately, we have to go through this in addition to that almost none of you understand scientific measurements. And what numbers mean? Okay. So let me give you a couple frightening a couple examples. So when you hear on the radio when you hear on the radio in the news, it says 53% or 65% of the pop of Americans.  think that  the Hanson Brothers have great music  Okay, if you don't know who that is, that's a good thing. Okay?  So you read this and you say I'm 63% wife a lot of people lot of people must really like these, okay.  The first question you should always ask yourself is.  What size was the sample?  So that's 63% Do you have any idea do you ever want to take a guess at how big the sample was? They checked $0.63 for 63% of American how many people do you think they pulled?  On average. It's about 1500 people.  in a country of millions tens of Millions  That's true.  Horse use a very that uses metric that says and it used to work really used to work pretty well that if you make phone calls if you checked if you if you stand in front of the grocery store and you ask people questions that if you asked about 1,500 people total, you got a pretty good picture. Okay now that used to work until people had cell phones.  Now if you call somebody at their house and you're asking them a question, like do you think the economy is better or what? Have you first of all most people only answer the phone or hang up on you the people answer.  Are the ones you are usually disgruntled and depending on how you act ask the question you can get whatever result you want. So it's important to understand the parameters in which a measurement is made.  That's very important.  Years ago. This is the sort of the one example that I also use in this case years ago there was and it was like maybe 16 17 years ago. There was a pole that came out that said people that drink decaffeinated coffee live longer than people who drink caffeinated coffee. Okay with the intent of making it sound like decaffeinated coffee stuck when you hear that. What is it make you think makes you think decaffeinated coffee makes you live longer.  Okay. Well my point I pointed out to somebody who was who was cuz I love coffee and he was pulling I was pulling it out to somebody and he was pointing this out and how he was going to live longer because he was drinking decaffeinated coffee and I said that result is bullshit.  And he said how can you say that? I said Okay can have said very quickly. First of all someone who drinks decaffeinated coffee is first of all, probably health-conscious.  Second of all probably doesn't smoke.  bird probably exercises  Are probably watches what they eat someone who drink caffeinated coffee? Don't get me wrong. It's not that they don't fit that bill as well. But by and large, they just don't care. They're drinking caffeinated coffee. They're not they don't see the the the decaffeinated which tastes terrible anyway as being any  Getting any advantage. So you already skewed the population that you're sampling. So and in fact the people who wrote this had to withdraw their analysis because that's exactly what they did. They when they found that the people they were checking. They were doing one more health-conscious. If you ask somebody do you drink caffeine coffee or decaffeinated coffee? Then you ask them. Do you exercised smoke those kind of questions that if you compared caffeinated and non-caffeinated people are exactly the same.  So it depends on how you make the measurement. It depends on the size of the analysis what you're doing and that's what I want to point out to you that when you're looking at numbers when you're looking at results in science understand that there are some questions that you have to ask about how the measurement was made. And what does it really mean and that's what we're going to talk about here. So first of all science about making observations and measurements, we also have to convey to somebody how good that measurement is or how good we think that measurement is or  How precise and accurate with exact measurement is K or quantitative measurements are made using some sort of a device either analog or digital and don't be fooled.  Analog Devices are just as accurate as digital devices.  analog analog clock k  Digital iPad clock if I showed it to you which one is more precise, which one's more accurate.  The boat if they're both calibrated correctly.  They should both be exactly the same.  But people think that digital is better people think digital is more accurate digital isn't more accurate.  I have a digital clock in my car set to be 7 Minutes fast. So I never laid anywhere.  Is my digital clock accurate? No.  Because I said it to be 7 Minutes fast. So again instrument whether it's analog or digital. It doesn't matter what matters is how it was calibrated how it was set up.  You need three things for any measurement you need a value and the magnitude and or the magnitude you need units and you need error other good news is error. We don't we the way we going to convey error is we're going to convey that using something called significant figures. But any measurement must tell you what the plus or minus is.  k  so for example, they say 63% of Americans think The Hansons music is great. And the error is plus or minus 20%  What does that tell you about the measurement that tells you it was a terrible measurement?  Want some measurements just because of how they're done.  Have an error associated with it.  That you just might have a big error associated with it. Just because how it's done. There's just nothing you get around that but what it means is that you must when you look at the results, you must realize that number is the average of low measurements and high measurements have been made.  Units are really important. You must tell people what the units are all data collection as errors associated with it. And there are two types of Errors determinant errors are called systematic errors. They have a definite Direction and a magnitude and have an assignable cause for example the clock in my car that is 7 Minutes fast. That is a determinant error. It's always 7 Minutes fast and it's 7 Minutes fast because I said it 7 minutes past.  k  It has a determinate error and it has a direction. It's bigger faster. Now. How do we get around to determinant are one of the ways to get around to determinate?  Is to take a starting value or take a final value and subtract from it a starting value. So for example on a scale you weigh something and it says sorry you take of you take a weight on a scale before anything's on it and it says zero one and then you take the weight when there's something on the scale.  1.02 you subtract from the weight that you with a scale loaded minus the weight with a scale unloaded and you get the difference that difference has the correct is correct. So determined and errors can be can be gotten rid of by doing things like this by doing measurements of final minus initial kind of things. We do that a lot in the lab determining errors aren't usually a problem what are problem us are indeterminate and determinate errors are called random errors or noise. I rather call them random random errors their errors that simply arise from uncertainties in a measurement K swap EG techniques. Now, that's something that you can overcome, but sometimes it just happens.  From anomalous physical and environmental factors know what on Earth does that mean you're going to find this out first hand if you're weighing something on a scale and somebody walks by you sometimes just them hitting the floor and now we are aware around this in the lab can cause the scale to give a funny reading.  Also, just an air current going by can change the reading on a scale.  Something cooling putting something hot on a scale what you never do but putting something hot on a scale.  As it cools off its weight will change it could go up. It can go down. It depends usually goes up.  But again, these are indeterminate errors. And here's the important thing about an indeterminate error. They are usually unreproducible.  And unfortunately because they're on reproducible.  We never know they're there.  So how do we get around indeterminate errors, which cannot be eliminated?  What you do or multiple trials exactly?  You do more than one experiment more than one trout out in the lab. We don't get his income for labs and in science and in the labs the teaching Labs, we don't get as much of a chance to do that because we just don't have a time but that's the bottom line is far as that kind of stuff goes.  Hercules accuracy and precision are two terms that people never really students right never really come to grips with professors as well accuracy is something that you use but you don't really know what it means accuracy is how close is your value to the real value and most of the times we don't know what the real value is to determine accuracy. You need to know what the real value is most of the times you're never going to know what the real value is in some cases you will but most times you don't so what we worry about more in the lab is precision.  Precision is how close are individual measurements that you make how close are they to one another and that's what we strive for in the laptop. We try to make sure that our Precision is as high as possible. Hoping that the Adobe accurate as well. OK unless you can see up here. You can see the first one precise but not accurate another words all of the num over the numbers are all of the the values on this thing OK or very close to one another but not close to the actor down to the red. Here.  They are not precise, but they're accurate because of the fact.  But the average of those three is right at the accurate value.  No, sometimes that's just pure luck. And sometimes that's what you get the cause of indeterminate errors that you can't get rid of over here is probably one of the worst possible cases you can have that is where you're neither precise nor accurate.  Values are all over the place and they're not even close. The average is being really close to what the real value is.  That's the kind of thing that when you see  you know that whoever did it just didn't care or was drunk or you never want to be a scientist who is neither accurate nor precise.  Finally the last one the luckiest of all of them is when your precise and accurate now again, if you do everything correctly.  Being accurate and precise is not a problem. But again we strive in our kin in this class to make sure that wears precise as possible and the accuracy is something that will be determined when you turn your experiment in the end.  Measurements of a function of what you're using to do the measurement again, here is a bar that black bar up there.  how precise  how precisely you can measure it is a function of the Precision of what you're measuring it with. So if you have a ruler that measures in point one unit precision.  And you ever met and you have a ruler that measures in .01 unit precision?  The more precise ruler is going to give you a more precise value.  Okay.  So again, what is the true value what depends on what you measured it with? Okay.  What is the error we are is also a function of what you measured it with and how you made the measurement if you made it by eye.  Then it's a function of how good of an eye you had when you made it.  How well did you look at? How closely did you look at it?  How can we how can we determine that something is going to be as precise as possible? We calibrate it.  In other words, we would take a ruler.  And we would take some bar that we knew was exactly 10.000 inches and we would because it was made precisely to be that we would compare its value with what we get on the ruler and that would tell us what the error on the ruler is.  2 calibration is a way to say. All right, when I use this ruler when I use this scale, I am always going to have to subtract this much off of the value add this much to the value most of the instruments that you use are calibrated or you will calibrate them.  Most of things like rulers aren't calibrated. For example, when you use a burette in the lab, which ruler would have you read is or a pipette pipette Cinder X have been calibrated. We know exactly how much Volume 8 how much volume they deliver que. No analytically  What we talk about when we talk about equipment.  There are two types of analytical equipment especially those used for measuring things. They're what are called TD.  NTC  TD stands for to deliver  So if something is a TD pipette, let's is a 10.00 TD pipette. That means that pipette is calibrated to deliver 10.00. Ml.  Where the air is in that last usually there's an error on these things as well. I to contain.  Is an analytical device?  Whose job is to know precisely how much something contains.  It does not precise as far as delivery. It's only as precise as how much you can put into it. So for example TD glassware that you're going to use.  barrettes  pipettes  these are made to deliver what it says.  TC the most common TC is a volumetric flask.  There's something else you use in the lab. And in those you have to look and see what it says on their knees are graduated cylinders.  Graduated cylinders can either be TD or TC you have to look and see what it says on it. Usually the ones that you use are to deliver but there are some that RTC I always tell people that you need to look at what the graduated cylinder says as far as that goes. I always consider graduated cylinders personally almost all the ones I've used or two delivers, but they're not very precise and that's part of the problem.  How precise is the glassware you were using?  A multiple measurements are used to give us the mean and corrected standard standard deviation. I put these formulas on here. I don't expect you to know them. And in fact with the exception of the mean of the mean you're never going to really the average the mean is the average you're never really going to ever need to calculate standard deviation. Although at least one experiment. I will ask you to do that. But standard deviation is basically the deviation of each or it's the square root of the deviation of each measurement from the mean  Okay, there's something called CV which is the coefficient of variance which is nothing more than the it's nothing more than the standard deviation divided by the average times a hundred it gives you a basically what it is. It's like a percent difference. It's something you won't run across in this class, but it's something that you'll see eventually some more useful standard deviation doesn't really mean much to most people and it shouldn't because you have no real feel for for what it's really all about.  Switch leads are two significant figures the old measurements were determined values contain significant figures that have to convey to the reader the certainty of the measurement. This is where sig figs come in, but there is something called an exact value exact values are exact numbers have an unlimited number of sig figs never detract from the measurement and its subsequent modification or use in other words and exact value is just that an exact value. There should be no error associated with so for example, if I say, there are one two, three, four, five, six, seven eight nine 10 11 people sitting in this front row.  11.1  The word 10.8. There are 11 people because it is an exact number a person is an exact count. Now the only reason you know, that that's exact is because first of all, you know, I hope that I can count to 11.  Okay, what about a stadium where they say there are 52175 people at the game?  Is that an exact number?  7 exact number  Are we say yes.  How many say no.  About fifty-fifty. It's not an exact number. Why is it not an exact number? How do they do the counts?  Ticket sales does everybody that buy a ticket show up to the game?  No, what about the what about the janitors? Do they have to buy a ticket?  What about the Benders today buy a ticket?  What about the players today buy ticket? What about the owners? Did they buy a ticket know that number is because of how it's determined.  Because the house determined is it an exact value. So, how do you get around this? Will normally you think in your own you think of your own experience? What number can you can you count up to if you're pounding something and always be sure that that number is correct. Well, I asked you to do this go get a bag of M&M's eat these afterwards and count a hundred M&M's then put it back in the bag or sorry take that start with M&Ms and Karen again.  See to get a hundred the second time.  What you find very quickly is that as the number that you count goes up error start to creep in and they creep in because mentally can't always keep especially for someone talking. You can't always keep track of it. So how do we get around this in science?  Well, we're going to find these kinds of things were going to go from that almost everything we deal with are measured values and measured values have seen things associated with it has to convey the level of precision of the measurement to a third-party measured value is comprised of digits that we know for certain plus one when we are uncertain dub. I used to call this better body part K works like this.  You tell somebody a number 1.66 1.66 ML and then they say to you. Are you willing to bet a body part that that one is correct?  And you go by the way if you make a mistake, you lose a body part anyway, so you said one? Oh, no, I know that one is correct because I could read that on the scale.  What about the second number? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure of that one. But what about the third that third six or a second sick, but they're digit II 6 don't you know, that is the one that I had to estimate.  That's the one that know I won't buy the better body part on that one.  The first digit that you won't that a body part on.  Is the last digit you were allowed to keep everything after that you have to ignore. So for example in this one here in this in this picture that I have here. Okay. We looking we say all right. Here is the one  We're sure of that.  1 2 3 4 5 6 we're sure of the six because we can read the one we can read the six but now we get a chance.  Take put one more digit in and this is the digit that we are uncertain of.  The first two are the certain digits. The last one is the uncertain and we are allowed to put one uncertain digit in and that's where the six comes from. By the way. This is what's known as a meniscus this smiley face thing here.  Is a meniscus and you always read the meniscus from the bottom of it.  Not from up the side, but from the bottom.  So in this case we say one is a certain digit.  We are certain of the one we are certain of the six. That's six.  Is our only uncertain digit we can therefore report the two certain digits and the one on certain digit. We are allowed to report all the digits. We're certain of with the last digit being  The uncertain digit now, what does this convey to the reader this convenience to the reader that whatever you use to measure that?  You are absolutely sure of every digit except for that. Very last one. And that what you're saying.  When you do this is it you are saying that there is a plus or minus one in that last digit in other words this 1.66 by reporting this 1.66. What you are telling someone is the value.  is somewhere between  1.65  and 1.67 now for some  pieces of equipment  it might be bigger than point one or a sorry might be bigger than one in the uncertain digit, but for this class is purposes. We're going to assume it's going to be that plus one. So when you record  And this is a big difference in his first experiment and laters tomorrow. It's even worse. When you record a number on the graduated cylinder record the values that you can read off the graduated cylinder plus estimate what the last digit is going to be.  For some cases you're going to get for sig figs, by the way, the says three significant figure some cases, you'll get three. It depends on a scale on asking what we do is we say that the value of the scale gives you all digits are ARB  Are certain except for the very last digit now that's not a hundred percent true. That's what we have to use when were using the scales. You'll understand that when he's the way you see the scales that we use.  What are exact values exact values or are tough again Cardinal are counted values 123 molecules. If you had a way to account 423 molecules 13 Silverado 2500 electron cetera et cetera. If you had a way to count these we would count that we call those exact values, but you must be careful you have to ask yourself. Could you really count to 500 exact electrons and if the answer is no and you have to say no that's a measured value.  Okay. Now in this class we don't run across many exact values, but for the purposes of this class we are going to we are going to have some the most important of the exact values that we have a conversion factors, so  for example 1000  is 1 km 1 km is exactly 1000 exactly.  1 lb is exactly 16 oz and so conversion factors. There are no significant figures associated with those they are exact values. They are exactly what they say. They are. Okay now in general we can say I'm sorry in general what we can say is this  all  metric to metric or English to English conversions are defined and exact.  That's what we're going to make we're going to make that assumption in this class. It's it's not an assumption for a lot of things but you'll understand though. There are times when it's going to the case. There's only one exact English to metric conversion.  There is only one exact English to metric conversion.  And that is this one?  You know why that's exact.  Because Congress voted it exact.  I need an exact conversion. That's the one that came up with. That's what a lot of times when you see a metric to english conversion.  You see that conversion come into play because that isn't exactly what are conversions to be exact because we don't want to lose any data. We don't want to lose that have any errors because of our conversion. What about Constance? Like for example, the speed of light C is equal to 2.998 x 10 to the 8th meters per second. Most of you have learned the speed of light is being 3 3 * 10 to the -10 to the eighth starting -8 in the eighth. Okay. Well, how do we treat a constant?  Speed of light universal gas constant atomic masses found in the periodic table. These are tricky and what I'm going to say to you applies to this class only to this class.  By definition constants are determined values and their need to complete an inequality.  Like TV like are the universal gas constant is equal to the pressure of a gas X the volume of the gas. / the moles of the gas. We have and the temperature.  Because of this they do have sig figs associated with them and they're not exact numbers. However, in this class we are never going to allow a constant to determine the number of sig figs in our final answer in other words. We are going to treat constants as if they were exact values.  Hey now. Why is that?  Tell by the way, you're going to your professors in other classes, you'll take they're going to tell you that's nonsense, but that's that last paragraph there.  Why can we do this? The reason lies in the fact that if you look long enough, you can find any constant with more sig figs and other words be more precise than the least precise value. You have been given or you have measured.  You can find the speed of light out too. I think 10 digits.  Well, if the speed of light can be done out to 10 digits, why don't we just simply treat it as if it was a constant as if it were an exact number and even though it's not an exact number. We're going to treat it as such.  Okay, because if this were simply going to use the concepts we have in our book or given on tests and assume that they have more sig figs, then we need in other words. We're never going to let a constant determine the number of sig figs are answer can have  and we're never going to let a concert determine the number of sig figs are answer can have  How do we determine sig figs?  Any non if you are given a number of this is important now we're talkin about a number that you're being given not something you've measured we've already determined that we do that but you're given a number. How do you determine how many sig figs in it are in it first of all?  All nonzero integers always count as significant figures.  there's always going to be assumed to plus minus one difference in the last significant digits shown unless we tell you otherwise, so  for example if I say something like  1285  because all of those numbers are because all of those are non zeros, they are all significant if I say one.  1.672  because there are no zeros there. They're all significant. We assume that the air is in the last digit.  That's are uncertain and it's plus or minus 1 zeros are tricky because there's three types of zeros.  Captain xero's Captain zeros or zeroes that are between digits K between nonzero digits. So for example  the captive a captive zero  like that and like that 1001 those digits.  I-10 between  digits between nonzero digits are significant.  Okay.  So Captain zeros are always significant.  Leading zeros on the other hand are never significant that what we call placeholders a lot of times, okay.  Leading zeros are never significant all zeros before the first non-zero digit.  Will never be significant.  k  so we know all captive zeros are significant. All Trail all leading. Zeros are significant. What about trailing zeros? And this is where?  It gets a little tricky and that is trailing zeros are zeros after the last.  non-zero digit  Those zeros will only be significant.  If there is a decimal place a decimal point somewhere in the number.  Those. Those will only zeros will only be significant if there is a decimal point placed in the number somewhere, okay?  so for example if I say  but I have  210 Adams and I write it like I wrote on the board there.  Okay, what that tells me what that's you tell you.  is that  that was Zero isn't significant.  It means that the only two significant figures I have are the two and the one this zero is not a significant number what this tells me is that my number is really somewhere between 230.  + 200 + 200  Remember plus or minus in the last.  Uncertain digit and in this case the zeros not significant figure. So we ignore it. Now. What if I want a dead deer what if I wanted to convey to you that I had actually 210 exactly to do that what I would do.  To do that. What I would do is what I've done here. I would put a decimal point after the 0 and nothing else just a decimal point that decimal point is telling me and it's telling you that that last zero is significant.  Admit, I have somewhere between 209 and 211 other words plus or minus in that last digit, but it's telling you that I think that zero is significant.  k  So for example here.  In this example at the very end of this.  This 0.0.0 NetZero. Those are insignificant.  They're leading zeros, but because there is a decimal place in it those two zeros are significant.  So again leading zeros are never significant captive zeros are always significant trailing zeros are only significant if there's a decimal point somewhere in the in the number Okay. Now, what's the accept? What's how can we ensure?  How can we present a number to somebody to ensure that they know every digit that we're giving them a significant write it in scientific notation.  When a number is written in scientific notation and you never write sign scientific notation with leading zeros. Never.  Anytime a number is written in scientific in scientific notation. Every digit that you provide is significant. So for example  6.022  0  x 10 to the 23rd has one two, three, four, five significant figures another word scientific notation convey to the reader the exact number of sig figs that you have. There is still that plus or minus in the last digit that last digit is still the uncertain digit, but all the digits are significant.  I'm in terms of calculations you can ignore.  For the time being sorry for the time being.  You can ignore log and antilog if something comes up later on but in general in terms of multiplication and division, what you do is you do the math and the number that you're allowed to report can have no more significant figures than your least.  precise number  so in this case 14.3 three significant figures 0.01 to two significant figures for one significant figure I do the math.  And I'm only allowed to report one significant figure.  K multiplication division is easy addition subtraction where you have to be careful in addition and subtraction.  It's not the number of significant figures it matters. It's the number of decimal space decimal places for addition and subtraction. You are never allowed to report more significant or more decimal places.  Then you're least accurate.  Number has so in this case 14.3 - 0.012 + 8.02 to 1.  Because 14.3 has only one decimal place. My answer can have only one decimal place in it. Okay?  Now the tricky one.  ONN rounding will get the rounding in just a minute. What about a combined calculations that have both addition and subtraction or both have addition subtraction and multiplication division. It is a really bizarre tough. You don't want to cross this a lot of times but you can read up here what I have said, but I'll simply tell you this.  What you do when you do these is figure out how many significant figures you were allowed.  Get the number to that many sig figs and then check to see decimal places and make sure that you have no more decimal places in you're allowed. In other words. You can have a few what number of significant figures.  Get a few or number of significant figures in your allowed, but you can never have more decimal point decimal spaces. Then you're allowed to come up very often, but it is something that you that I want to get across to you.  Welding is tricky because there's a couple ways to do this. By the way, you'll learn about something called the Banker's method. We never use the bankers back here. Basically, we're going to use rounding.  We're going to look at the last of the first digit that we have to drop in other words the first digit after the uncertain digit.  We're going to look at what that did you do is.  If it's 4 or less we're going to round down.  if it's 5 or greater when Roundup  simple k  That's how we're going to do it. Now. There is something on the bankers rule that has to do with with fives, but we're not going to deal with that one. It is important to remember this and this is the thing that you have to keep in mind do not round as you go along always round at the end of any set of calculations another word keep as many digits as you can as you're going through the calculation and round at the very end. Okay. So for example, if we were rounding this number down here  this is where  To three significant figures this number here, okay.  I would go. Okay three significant figure starting from the left. That's one two three.  everything else  I can't keep but I have to decide.  When I before I drop those I have to decide what am I going to do with that last digit? I'm allowed to keep and what I do with that.  Depends on what that first digit I'm going to drop his so what I do is I automatically ignore everything after that digit that I have to drop and I apply my rules here. It is a 4  Because it's between 1 and 4. That means I round down and by rounding down what that means is that I just simply keep the number as written. And so this becomes  24.7  okay.  The Temptation with that number there is a route it up because you know 4.9. I know that's almost five 5 with round that thing up. You don't do that. Okay.  Always make it simple ignore every digit except the uncertain digit the last significant figure. You're allowed to keep in the one right after it and make your decision based on that number on that number right on that digit right after your last significant figure.  My calculations scientific notation. I'm going to let you do that one on your own because that's not that hard. Most of you can do it.  Scientific notation again, whether the weather the exponent in scientific notation is plus or minus is telling you which way you're moving or either moving to the left.  You're either moving to the left in which case it's a plus move it to the right. It's minus.  When you write a number in significant figures the number that you write.  must have  a number to the left of the decimal point between 1 and 9  now that's going to change that rule up a little bit later, but for the time being when you write a number in significant figures.  When you write a story when you write a number in scientific notation.  It should be xpoint yyyy that X that very first number needs to be somewhere between 1 and 9. It can't be bigger than 910 or above.  And it can't be zero.  Again, you'll understand that gets modified. You'll understand that but right now we're going to work with that rule. We'll talk about when we modify that later on.  P x values for the time being I put this light in here. It's something I don't expect you to know now.  It's just something for later on in the course, but take a look at it power values is a way of representing numbers in scientific notation representing them in decimal fraction form, but we show up here for the time being we're not going to worry about it. But when we talk about pH at the end of the course will come back to this and talk about it talk about it at that point in time units are just as important as the numbers the units tell us what we're talking about. The units need to be detailed a number with no units is not correct in this is how it's going to work. If on an exam you give me the correct value but no units you will get a zero for the problem.  Auto-Lab, if you give me a number with no units you get a zero for your work.  You must show units.  If you go up if you go into a store and you stand up at the butcher's counter you say I want one the butcher's going to look at you and say one what I want one pound and 1 pound 1 pound of what you don't know Hamburger.  Okay. Do you want the 70% the 80% or the 90%  I'll take the 80% Okay?  Do you want bison or Buffalo or do you want?  How we hit this morning on the way in? Okay, your units have to be  A specific is necessary, but you must have units associated with something. Sometimes the units can be very complicating 12.7 pounds of lean hamburger that is telling when you say that that means that you want one point or 12.7 lb of lean hamburger not the hamburger that has a lot of fat in it. You are being very specific about what you want three atoms vs. 3 sodium atoms vs. 3 sodium ions three atoms can be three atoms of any three of anything.  3 sodium atoms is 3 sodium atoms. But an atom by definition is not charged. If you want charged sodium atoms you have to have irons in the end. We use SI or metric units almost exclusively length is in meters the fundamental units and they were drive units fundamental units are the units that basically makeup all other units things like meters kilograms seconds. And then there are drive units drive units are things like the juul. The Joule is a Newton meter per second.  A newton is a meter per second.  Are meter kilogram per second, in other words drive units are units we use to simplify what we're talking about.  We use a lot of derived units in this class only time you ever really no need to know. What a derived unit is made out of is if for some reason you have to backtrack and kind of figure out what actually is going on. We also use power prefixes to relay the quantity without using scientific notation and the power prefix is that you need to know we're on this slide and the ones I absolutely absolutely want you to know are the ones that are in the boxes. So those are the ones that will use again and again, so, for example when I say it is the last thing I'm going to do today when I say A Pico  When I say A Pico or 12 Pico moles.  What I mean is 12 * 10 to the -12.  Malls, the Pico means I don't have to show that 10 to the -12, please do. Otherwise, I'll see you on Thursday. Please. Make sure you watch tell you look at Ed and take your safety quizzes. "
