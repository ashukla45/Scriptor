  "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started.  What do I question a little bit?  Your question in a little bit here. I'm so  couple things first of all exam to the average with 54% That's sort of normal for that exam. I can't say it slow because it's about what you normally see.  The answers to the Scantron which is all it was obviously a post about Triton Ed. One of the things that I had said in in the in the announcement email that you got was that you should go through that test. You should make sure you know how to do every one of those problems and not only in the forward Direction you should be able to do them in the back Direction Little Words by give you quote. See if I give you the answer you should be able to figure out how much is one of the starting materials you have because that's what your final exam is going to look like there is going to be a Lewis structure on if there is going to be stuffed were talking about now, but the calculation of stuff is a big deal on the final exam. It looks a lot like exam to and nomenclature you need to make sure that you know your nomenclature. Just a minute. I'm the volumetric lab is Friday. That's the last of the wet labs and that is actually is a very easy left if you have prepped for it you're doing nothing.  But a titration there are some very bizarre some interesting know some bizarre terms in it. It is wrong testing purposes an experiment believe it or not that you are actually going to cheat in chem 7 l44 more points as it turns out it is very simple. It's your it's an introduction to a titration its introduction to using up your rent from an analytical standpoint. Make sure that you are prepped and up and ready for that Lab at it's posted. It's ready to go on the ionic reactions lab report, which is original. Did you do today? I decided to wait until Thursday to give it to get it done. I mostly cuz there's some stuff I want to talk about today. But also there are some issues about students getting back to campus farm from some of their trips because of weather and stuff like that, but it is due on Thursday by noon supposed to rain Thursday. So the turn in station  If it gets really windy, I might win. I might want might wind up having to move the Turning station. But if I do I'll put a note up to that effect. The volumetric lab is the one that's got a different due date that is a week from today. So you finished you do it on Friday to turn it in Tuesday. So that in the end again.  Just to remind you the questions of the or the post lab questions and the discussion those go to your lab on Friday. Those never get turned into the buckets. But again, the volumetric lab report is due next Tuesday by noon, but still follow the questions regarding or the post lab questions and discussions those who go to your Ta on the fall on that next Friday on the nomenclature quiz to see if the scores are posted. I might just didn't tell you last last night when I posted them. The average was 13.7 out of 25 about 55% that actually  Ears as much as I hate to say this, that's normal. I don't think anybody should get lower and I said this before nobody in his Clash of getting lower than 80% on the nomenclature quiz, okay, but there were two shoes and zeros and Force if you don't know nomenclature change your major now now if you're just taking this class has a GE, okay, I can understand it. When the hell are you ever going to need to know what's ferrous chloride is okay. If you're in business unless you're selling chemical or you're doing drug trade or something. You need to know what those chemicals are. Okay.  But if you are going on to 6A 6B 6E our science major, you need to start you need to start putting some time on these things and learn the easiest things will ever have to do in science and chemistry in particular after this gets people just assume, you know how to do it and this is something this is one of these lessons that I have to die. I hate to have to say but I've got to tell you Life your life of a Simplicity in freshman. This is over next quarter all hell breaks loose and it just gets worse.  Hey, because in your in your first quarter as a freshman people are willing to forgive you. Thanks. Next quarter. Not so much. No granted 6 a.m. Most of you were going to find 6 a.m. A breeze and it's cuz it is six a CZ is easy. That doesn't mean you don't study.  I mean, I know you had friends all your friends were laughing at you for being in cam for learning all this stuff you with the laugh at them next Corner when they're in 6p.  6B  As I used to say the b is doesn't mean it's the second in the series The b means.  K & C is worse.  K C is worse and this is something you're going to learn as you go through the chemistry sequence as you go through most sequences the bee and the Sea of any sequence is usually the bee is usually the hardest of the whole sequence and series can be that one thing is if you learn 6B sixties, not that difficult, but if you come into a 60 instructor and you had a lousy 6B instruct, yeah, your life is not going to be fun today. So you guys are a lot more than you think you do but it's but there was something that you really need to crack down on nomenclature is one make sure you know how to do stoichiometry. And I know that there are a few of you that are struggling  And a few of you that are struggling. I know I understand the stuff is this stuff is not that easy. It's not it's not something it's in your comfort zone.  Okay, it's not in your comfort zone. I understand that.  If you need to talk to me about ways to prep for act for exam if I had a deal with exams how to deal with the pressures. You can come and talk to me. I'm more than happy to discuss this with you. I have I had to go to the same problems myself when I was in school. And by the way, for those of you who think that I was born some kind of freaking genius with the exception of organic chemistry, which I am pretty much a genius said I was good trust me. I was good as an undergraduate organic only chemistry class that I didn't have to struggle in. Okay physical chemistry. I still don't know how I passed a class, but I have a general chemistry II worked hard to learn the stuff in the reason the way I teach it to you.  Is how I had to learn it because I couldn't understand what my professors were telling me.  I had to learn it from a nuts and bolts in a basic stamp. And that's why I'm trying to teach to you and always want to get out of this class always go back to the fundamentals. If you don't really understand something make sure you go over your exams exam to and use that as your prep for your final exam. All right, let's do this module here where we were talking. I actually posted this already. These are actually the answers to that to the to the redox a business again to summarize redox. Chemistry redox reactions can be tricky to be tricky to pick out but generally speaking they're not as hard as you think typically if an element is used up an element in Elemental form is used.  Or produced during the reaction. For example, you use up oxygen or you produce hydrogen gas or you produce magnesium metal or you use up magnesium metal anytime you have something like that happening. You have a redox reaction. Sometimes Oxygen's when oxygen disappear from a compound or appear in a compound. That's a redox reaction. That's one you have to be careful of though cuz there are examples of redox are examples of reactions that are not redox reactions.  That look like them based on the number of oxygen always if you're not sure calculate the oxidation state of the element involved for example on the board classic one.  That I'll throw some times that I've thrown on exams before sometimes in in 6 H2O + CO2 gas.  Goes to give H2.  CO3 aqueous  students will iPad students look at this reaction and tell me it's a redox reaction and it's not.  And the way you can figure out that it's not is calculate the oxidation state of the carbon and you'll see that the carbons oxidation state doesn't change. But if you got to be careful in this kind of are in this kind of thing, so what is your week? What is a what is a reduction? What is a reductant a reductant is something that undergoes reduction?  It's some it loses electrons and it becomes oxidized say something undergoes. It undergoes oxidation but causes something else to undergo reduction. It is the reducing agent anything that becomes oxidized had to give its electrons up to something so it became oxidized it is the reducing agent because it reduced something else. It increases its oxidation number now, that means that the oxidation number becomes less or more positive. That's what we mean by increase its oxidation number and occident.  Is a species that is oxidizing something else.  And in the process of oxidizing something else it is becoming reduced.  Antoine oxidant gains electrons k  It is also called the oxidizing agent and it increases decreases its oxidation number or its oxidation number becomes less positive or more negative. The reason for going through the vernacular is simply is simply because once you really get out of this class really chemistry the term the terms oxidizing agent and reducing agent get used almost exclusively or to the exclusion of talking about something being oxidized or reduced and it's because once you get out of General chemistry sequence now, you're starting about talk talk about we agents are actually doing the chemistry. And so we use the terms agent for those again. It's It's Supernatural.  You need to get used to it's one that while I don't necessarily expect you to be fluent in it. I'd like you to be able to at least tell me what an ox is oxidizing agent is what a reducing agent is. I don't make your life in chemistry 6C much easier, which is nothing more than the study of oxidizing and reducing agents.  How do we recognize them on this is just a slide. I put in for doing this kind of stuff. First of all, these are all examples up here of Oxford of oxidation reduction reactions. And one of the ways you can tell this immediately is by looking at the actual reaction here and say well look here I have aluminum is being used up its making hydrogen gas. Those are the elemental forms of those here. I'm making lead Elemental Led Led solid again. I'm making an element from something that was not the elemental form on the other side and over here. I'm using up two elements to make it anytime an element is being used on an element is Elemental form is being used up or generated. You got a redox reaction. How do you determine what's undergoing oxidation and reduction?  You can see on this slide here. And I just done it for a that if we look at aluminum aluminum is 0 and its oxidation state cuz it's dalmont K sulfuric acid is got a + 6 for the Sulphur, okay.  It's got plus one for the hydrogen is got mine is too for the oxygen when you get over to the other side. You noticed that the aluminum.  Is now plus 3 so the aluminum lost 3 electrons.  So if it lost electrons it underwent oxidation, okay?  Therefore it must be the reducing agent hydrogen goes from being plus one to give hydrogen gas hydrogen gas is a zero because an element is the element. So the oxidation number of hydrogen decreases hydrogen is reduced. Therefore H2 so4 is the oxidizing agent because that's where the hydrogens started off.  Okay.  Is always here. Yes, if an element in its Elemental form its oxidation number is zero. So that means if it's diatomic it's zero if it's if it's like Elemental lead something like that. It's zero. It's just one of those it's it's how we Define the oxidation state again. You should be able to do this for the other ones up here is to determine what the oxidizing agents in what the reducing agents are.  This leads us to something called the activity series of metals. Now, you did a little bit of this in the lab. What is the activity series what the activity series does is it rank the metals in the periodic table?  From most active to least active and another way to put this is from is from most reactive to least reactive metals reactivity Series has its has history with engineer's and Engineers are interested in metals. And one of the things engineers realized and chemistry as well come as early material scientist is it not all elements could be found or Metals could be found there metallic form and its some metals were extremely difficult to put into their metallic form.  And it's some battles were so reactive in there metal in their metallic form in their Elemental form that they couldn't be kept around dangerous. In fact, if you did this what you could come up with is something called the activity series of  Does activity steer series for the metals now what this is is it ranks the medals from the most reactive?  to the least  reactive  and what we're looking at here in terms of reactivity is the metal as a solid going to give the metal.  as an iron  plus an electrons. So what we're looking at here is in this is the ability of the metal.  To act as a reducing agent to give up its electrons.  Some of its electron so things like lithium potassium barium calcium sodium are so reactive that they react with water.  Other things like magnesium aluminum manganese, they will react they react very very slowly with water.  But if you heat the water.  If the water is hot, I can steam it can it can works there very they're not very reactive to water but they are reacted as a temperature goes up something you'll learn more about a kinetic sand. I'm 16 finally bit down to Cobalt nickel 10 and led by the way. This also goes for for the H2 from Steam. They can displace H2 from acid and the same goes for those that can displace H2 from Steam by and large in the presence of acid H+. These will also undergo the also undergo this Productions this giving up of electrons hydrogen gas. H2 is used to break point.  And then below that we have the metals that don't react with acid nor do they react with water things like copper Mercury silver gold.  Copper silver and gold being known as what I called the coinage metals.  Because they're stable enough to be to be used as a coin. So the activity series.  Has a use here and see if I have the whole thing here. Yeah, what are the things that you can say from from the Des or when you're doing this is that in terms of the activity series?  any metal  Can reduce the ionic form of any metal that's below it in the activity series. Now, what does this mean? Well, it means for example that if I were going to take if I were to look say at aluminum  3 + K if I were to take  sodium metal  in the presence of aluminum 3 plus  and ask is will this reaction occur to give me sodium Plus?  Plus aluminum as a solid + aluminum metal. So what you would do is go over to the activity series K find sodium K there is sodium metal K find aluminum and then put it in form if the ionic form of the metal.  If the ionic form of the metal is below.  The metal that you're using in the reaction the reaction will occur. So this for example this reaction will  occur  so this will  Occur, for example, I asked the question of this one if I said let's say I had Cobalt solid Plus.  Aluminum 3 + will this go to give me Kobalt 3 plus doesn't really matter about the charge on the at this point the charge doesn't matter. It just matters whether something is losing electrons or gaining it. Will this go to give me this + aluminum as a solid again what I'm going to do. We're going to come up here and I'm going to find Cobalt.  There is Cobalt and again here is aluminum.  Disc in this case the Macadam Neville Cobalt is below the ionic form of the of the other metal aluminum 3 plus is above aluminum is above the Solunar 3 + would be above it there for this reaction.  Will not.  Her and this brings up a sort of an a theme that you're going to find Going Through Chemistry and that is in general. We can say that's longer.  species under go reaction  to give weaker species  so for example strong  oxidizing agent plus a strong  reducing agent will go to give a weaker.  oxidizing agent plus a weaker  reducing agent this is going to be true and acid-base chemistry as well you go from strong acid from a stronger acid and a stronger base to a weaker acid and a weak base and you cannot believe  how much I have to beat this into my 40 + 40 B students organic freaking chemistry. I could have beaten into them because in when you get to organic understanding that principal will allow you to understand why whole Myriad of reactions occur.  Okay, but it's this theme of weaker or stronger going to weaker is one you can always rely on. So in this case what we're looking at is we're looking at the more reactive metal.  The more reactive metal undergoing reaction to produce a less reactive metal.  We're looking at a reactive metal.  Undergoing reaction to give a less reactive metal.  This is what I was talking about. This is this idea of the fact that a more active metal can displace another and ionic form in a compound. This is just saying that a more reactive metal can take the ionic form of a less reactive metal.  And turn it into its metallic form while turning itself into a psionic form here. We see silver nitrate silver plus one reacting with copper metal to give copper II plus and silver metal head again. If you look at the if you look at the previous slide, you'll see that silver.  Is less reactive than copper copper lies higher.  On at copper metal lies higher on that scale than the silver metal does.  Again, this is nothing more than the same reaction just essentially talking now in terms of reducing agents. The copper loses two electrons for copper atom the silver gains one electron for silver atom. That's why you need two of them.  So the copper is a reducing agent and the silver nitrate is the oxidizing agent. And by the way when you look at these reaction you're talking about agents.  It's always you're talking about what's on the left side of the equation not what's on the right side of the equation. We read these equations the same way. We read a sentence in English. We read it from the left to the right and that's what we're always going to be doing with chemical reaction. We read them from the left to the right and decide based on the reaction as written as to whether it will occur or not.  You can't read backwards k?  It's like the quickest way to ruin a good book is to read the ending first.  today  I swear you and I like it. I think I've done this before I did this with the last of the Harry Potter books.  I mean, I read the last I read the last thing I'm going like  and I wish I hadn't done it but  play tell me the book wasn't still good but books are better than movies, but  they always are okay.  Now to the last of the sort of the classic reaction that we need to talk about and these are acid base reactions. These are the most for thoroughly studied thoroughly thoroughly studied of organic reactions. They are also there I'm not going to say that they're the most useful but they're the easiest I think other than the double displacement of the easiest wants to understand what's going on redox reactions are very complicated and it gets very very complicated very very fast and they are really important acid-base reactions in understanding acid-base chemistry is also really important but they've also been studied a lot you will spend you'll spend half of 6 b or 1/3 of 6 be and probably f36 doing more acid-base chemistry than you ever thought you never do.  Many a reaction to you studying organic and biochemistry have an acid base component to them in aqueous solution acids are compounds that dissolve and I and eyes to produce excess H+. Now. This is you're going to see on a slide 2 minute. It's not a hundred percent true. They don't really produce H+. They produce h3o + bull explain explain that to you in a little bit here bases are compounds are dissolved to produce excess o h - again that's not a hundred percent true, but in general chemistry and particularly in camphor.  Ask being species that produce H+.  And bases being a species to produce a o h minus in water.  Our Fair  definitions  oh, by the way, you also have to be careful just because something has o h in it doesn't mean  that it is a base.  for example alcohols  havo agent this compound  ch3 ch2 o h  that has a carbon oxygen covalent bond. It is not a base. In fact, the only time that oh will be a base is if it's combined with a metal the so-called metal hydroxides.  Have to be careful just because ucoh in the compound doesn't mean that it is a base. In fact, here's a compound.  And again when you're going to start doing Lewis structure soon anyway, so here's another compound.  ch3 C double bond o  awake  this compound by the way, this compound here is neither an acid or base neutral.  It hasn't always in it and it's a freaking acid.  That's known as acetic acid which you know is vinegar.  again weather the o h  Is neutral acidic or basic depends on what on what is attached to do if it's attached to a metal is basic?  If it's attached to a carbon, it depends on the carbon it's attached to as to what it's going to do as what it's going to be three key definitions of used in discussing acids and bases and their on this slide rainiest was the first to come up with the idea of an acid or a base. He said that acids were compounds that generate H+. An aqueous solution bases were compounds that generated o h minus in aqueous solution has an interesting fellow radius was the man was the first person to put forth the idea of irons in solution something we take for granted.  He was the one that came up with ions in solution.  He actually wrote his PhD thesis on this and I almost failed him for this because nobody believed in irons back in those days. He talked about I and they gave him the lowest possible pass you could get and still get your PhD and he won the Nobel Prize for it.  So don't let anybody squash your ideas unless it's me. No don't ever do this. This is the fellow who believe they had very good reasons for believing this but he was fighting against the tide people who didn't believe in it.  Today we take the idea of the ionic nature of things as gospel. But back in the day when the rainiest was writing about this wasn't  Unfortunately, a rainiest definition of acids and bases is incomplete and part of the reason was first of all, H+ could never be demonstrated.  As being a free species in water, in other words, you could not actually detect H+ is by themselves floating in the water.  They knew they were there, but you couldn't find them.  Also H -4 bases there were bases that didn't make any sense based on that. So he looked at things when the rainiest rainiest would look at something like sodium hydroxide NaOH you put that in the water and you get an A+ plus o h minus.  But then there were compounds that were known to be bases like ammonia.  Ammonia is a base, but I don't see no h in there.  And so his definition while being good at the time had some glaring holes in it.  Bronsted-Lowry came up with a more by the way. We still use irenaeus definition is still useful. Don't get me wrong. But it's you it's it explains most acids and bases at least inorganic acids and bases.  How we came up with a more suitable definition of Bronsted-Lowry looked at it from this point acids react with bases.  Bases react with acids there had to be some commonality there had to be something in common with Bronson Lowry said is what is in common is the ability to either accept an H+ or donate an H+. And so what bronsted and Lowry said is that an acid is a proton or an H+ donor. This is where things get confusing in water solution acid-base chemistry.  A proton is not the term proton does not necessarily mean the nuclear particle. It's a term used for H+ for a hydrogen ion.  People have tried to get out of this but this nomenclature still sticks around it's going to be around as long as you're as long as you're probably going to be alive people have tried to get out of this Camp because the term proton for H+ is something that just is so ingrained in science. It's not coming out a base would be a proton acceptor an H+ acceptor. So if for example we looked at  Something like let's look at a reaction like this.  HCL aqueous  + NH  3 aqueous  when this reaction occurs you make nh4 + aqueous.  Plus co- aqueous notice that the H+.  But the HCL donated an H+ to that NH3 there for the HCL is our acid.  And our NH3 is our base based on the Bronsted-Lowry.  an H+ donor and an H+ acceptor a much more General and yet much more difficult to understand is the Loess definition Luis took this all the way down to discussion of electrons, and he said that an acid  Is an electron-pair acceptor?  And that a base is an electron-pair donor now until we go through Lewis structure. This definitions not really going to make a lot of sense until you actually see what a Lewis structure is. We've seen some of them.  What atoms can have what are known as lone pairs of electrons unshared pairs of electrons and those unshared pairs of electrons can either be donated to something or accept something so the term acid and base.  From a legal standpoint electron-pair acceptor on electric perdona. We'll talk about it more detail as we go on here. But again of the three definitions that's the one that I expect you to understand least in the one that you'll be tested on the least.  Operationally all of them are equivalent.  That's hard to believe but operationally all of these are equivalent Bronsted-Lowry is the one that use the most especially in general chemistry. But Louis is by far the most General in the one that you absolutely have to know when you get to the 40 series.  When you go to biochemistry because once you get out of aqueous Solutions, and once you start talking about proteins and biomolecules Louis definition is the one that you're going to use more often.  H+ as I said before is not a discrete species, it's not something that you it does not exist in water. But what happens is it water itself can act as a carrier for H+ and so an acid.  Does not generate H+. Instead what it does is it donates H+ to water to make the hydronium iron? So when we put for example HCL in water?  When we do something like pudding.  HCL aqueous  + H2O liquid we put this in water we're going to start to use equilibrium here because equilibrium is a big deal.  It will give h3o +.  Aqueous + hair co- aqueous where the H+ has been donated to the water. So H+ is not what we seeing solution rather is h3o. + so what you should understand here. Is this that H+  Oops, sorry.  H+  and h3o + are the same thing.  H+ and h3o + are the same thing. The difference is h3o + just shows what's actually going on at the H+ is being carried by the water molecule.  by the way in this reaction  Waters behaving as what Nassar base  behaving as base exactly what you're going to find out as we go through this as we go through water can behave as an acid or a base pending on what's being challenged with  it is what's called amphiprotic.  Don't try to write that down.  Amphiprotic means that it can either donate an H+ act as an acid or accepting H+ act as a base here. It's acting as a base.  The magnitude of the hydronium ion concentration the h3o + in moles per liter is what determines how acidic a solution is the larger?  a larger  BH  30 + concentration  the more acidic  the acid so weak acid produce a low concentration of h3o + strong acids like HCL produce a high concentration.  A trio plus is generated from H+ in the H+ comes directly from the after the consideration measurement of the h3o + concentration will have a direct correlation to the strength of the acid.  k  we don't actually measure the h3o + concentration directly instead. What we're going to do is we're going to measure something.  known as pH  pH is equal to -4 log  abh3 old + concentration  pH of the number to decimal fraction. It's like 2.75 something like that. It's a more convenient way to talk about the acidity in terms of pH.  in terms of pH  what we can say is  the lower the pH  the more acidic the solution is  short run sort of counter to what h3o + and it has to do with the fact that the log  So if you were looking at a solution that was say for example.  a pH of 2.3  Is more acidic?  Set up pH of 4.2.  lower the ph smart pH number the more acidic it is  conversion of pH  back into h3o + is pretty easy.  The h3o + concentration will be equal to 10 to the minus. Whatever the pH value is.  These are all questions. You'll have to answer on your on the lab.  So what we're going to do on Friday is going to measure the pH of solution to want to plot the pH of solution versus the amount of Base that we had. I'm going to block this to see what to do to drop something called a titration curve.  The term proton I've already talked about protons in archaic term that still use describe a hydrogen anion.  Unfortunately, it's a term that we you need to come to grips with an acid-base chemistry. It's still used to denote and acidic hydrogen. We talked about a proton transfer agent.  A proton transfer is an acid-base chemistry used to denote the transfer of a hydrogen ion from an acid to a base.  Hydrogen transfer reaction proton transfer reaction are very important in organic and biochemistry finally weak acid or a weak base strong acid strong base. The strength of an acid or a base is a direct function of the degree of ionization. In other words how much H+ rates per year plus a generates how much ohmi it would generate but it's a relative term.  The strength of an acid and I was a weak acid weak base and strong acid strong bases.  How well they do proton transfer but their relative terms.  Okay, if you go into a kindergarten classroom.  You are going to be the strongest thing in that room.  Okay, if you go into a WWF ring you're not.  It's all relative.  I don't think we have any WWF people in this room all though. I did a couple years ago have a kid did some of that mixed martial arts stuff was pretty badass, but  It didn't matter. I have a baseball bat in my office. Anyway, all right.  Actually don't I used to actually had a real baseball bat softball and it got into my office and I kept it there.  What city to deter students every once in awhile?  I was not so sure that the kid come at me.  Batter up. All right.  acid-base reactions in the most General sense  Look you teach long enough at you. If you're long enough at any job. There are stories you have that are just  UTEP when they happen to you don't think much of them and then years later you start to reflect on it and you start to go. Okay. How did I ever survive those years are in the most General sense an acid reacts with a base by transferring an ionizable hydrogen to it. So in this term were using in this equation here h a is what's known as a general acid.  HHA is what's known as a general?  Acid B and I don't mean Boron B is at or something we use for a general.  Bass and by that we mean any acid any base in general?  The way we look at it. Is this that an acid a general acid or any acid will give up its H+ to a base to give the protonated base. That's the pH plus plus a minus the counter Ian. The thing that actually had the H+ on it, but there's a turn there's a there's a this what's known as an equilibrium reaction. Meaning this reaction can be can be goes not only from left to right or from right to left. So let's look at this reaction from the right to the left. If we were to go from the right to the left first of all start by saying up here. This is an acid.  This is a base.  How about BH plus is that an acid or a base?  If that reaction would run in the reverse Direction.  Would be H+ be an acid or a base.  What you doing? Is it giving up an H+ or is it or is it accepting another H+?  What are you if you give up an H+?  You're an asset that means a minus which is picking up that that H+ has to be a base. So over here this isn't acid and this is base so we can stay then an acid plus a base gives an acid plus a base, but because that isn't clear enough as far as the reactant the way the reaction goes we use the term conjugate and the way the conjugate works is that whatever on the left hand side of the equation is the acid-base whatever's on the right hand side. We put the term conjugated in front of it so that be H+ is a conjugate  Acid, this is a con.  She did. Thanks so we can say in general that an acid plus a base goes to give a conjugate acid plus a conjugated base where the acid and the conjugate base are related to one another and the base and the conjugate acid are related to one another.  Another word a base will give a conjugate acid.  Acid will give a card you can base.  The term conjugate is used exclusively describe the materials in a product side of the reaction easy to write.  If you have any acid.  HHA all you have to do is remove an H+ from it to give A-  this is the nbha is the acid. This is the conjugate base.  o h a  For a base it's simple as well.  Bass  if I add an H+ to it I get BAH plus this is the conjugate acid.  Of the base. So for example  NH3  if I add H+ to it I get nh4 Plus.  But I can also do this with something like H2O adding H2O and H+ to it I get h3o +.  In terms of an acid I can have h3o h3o + if I lose H+. I get H2O again the relationship between the conjugates.  Is whether it has lost an H+ or gained an H+. So conjugates are very easy to are very easy to do.  If a car gets can be done for things that classically you would not think of as being acids or bases. So for example, think of NH3  What if NH3?  as an acid  if I lost H+ from this  I would make nh-2 - so this  Is the conjugate base?  of NH3 as an acid  Imagery at this point in time you're looking at it and going and yes, it can be depending on what you're challenging it with again Kim for TABC.  The term of conjugates this idea is very important because it lends us to something else and that is strong acids have weak conjugate bases.  Weak acids give strong conjugate bases. In other words, the strong weak relationship between conjugates. The only strange one in the whole thing. It's not really even a strange one is if you have a hydroxide base.  If you have an acid and the base is a hydroxide base we have what's known as a neutralization reaction and a neutralization reaction is a reaction that produces.  water as one of the products  an acid-base reaction produces water as one of the products is what's known as a neutralization reaction.  Here's a slide. I put up show you talk about strong acid strong bases. Here's what I want you to know memorize.  memorize the strong acids  memorize the strong bases in particular  in particular these hydroxides hear the oxides. We're not going to worry about right now. They are strong base things. Like for example, when I talk about the group 1 and group 2 oxide things like for example MGO  Na2o, these oxides are strong base before I can worry about those right now memorize the strong acids memorize the strong bases.  Anything that's not on this list.  Is a weak acid?  or weak base  There are far more weak acids and weak bases. Then there are strong acids and strong base. This is a list you're going to want to know not just for this class, but for 6abc you are going to be hit with this over and over again, especially when you're being asked whether something is a strong acid with a strong base. I do have to be careful here in general. There's one that's not on this list, but I'll put up because someone's going to tell you about it eventually.  Hclo3, that's also a strong acid. In fact in general.  HX 04  hxo 3 where X is equal to CL BR or I  are strong acids will why do we only put why does this list only have hclo4 on it?  because of all of these hclo4 is the most common one you're going to see  hclo3 don't see very often and I are so reactive so acidic they're just not used but hclo4 find out find all the time. It's in Bleach, by the way.  So these are bored what we call the common acids and bases anything not on this list, strong a strong bases anything. It's not on this list. You consider to be weak unless you're told otherwise the most common of the week basis by the way is one that you should memorize and that is ammonia. That's the most common weak base. That is without a doubt. The rebates are going to want to cross the most.  again in terms of strong  in terms of strong versus weak  strong acids completely ionize to yield strong electrolytes weak acids ionize very slightly generally less than 5% weak electrolyte Solutions. So what this means is that  What will happen here is that when I put this in water? I will have typically less than 1%  And typically greater than ninety 99% of it in the eye and eye solution once I put it in water the a check bhx essentially completely breaks up with H+ + x - okay.  A weak acid on the other hand when I put it in water.  Greater than 80% usually greater than 90% stays in its aisle in its is molecular form.  less than  20% and usually less than 10 or 5%  ionizes  So the difference between a strong acid and a strong base is really how willing that acid or sorry the difference in a strong acid and a weak acid is how willingly acid is to give up its H+ to water?  Okay.  Acetic acid is vinegar is a weak acid when you put that in the solution. You only generate about 1.3% of it.  Actually undergoes ionization.  It is a weak acid.  So strong acids and strong bases. And again, this comes down this electrolyte business strong electrolytes produce. Lots of ions in solution weak electrolytes.  Hilarious H+ ions in an aqueous solution of a strong acid again in this question. I'm talking about sulfuric acid. What is the molarity of H+ in 1.4 molar sulfuric acid or if you think about it?  I have sulfuric acid.  H2 so4 if this undergoes ionization it gives to H+ + so4 -2 so if the sulfuric acid is 1.4 molar  Okay, then that means that the H+ is going to be 2.8.  molar  Because you have to H+ has.  H2 so4 no again, you could do stoichiometry to figure this out as well. We will get the same answer.  So the malort the molarity of the H+ if we're going to give up on both of those would be double what you started with if you look for example at something like hclo4.  Hclo4 gives up H+ + clo4 - 2y have a solution that 0.1 molar in that the H+ will be 0.1 molar.  As well because only one H+ is given up by that hclo4.  Waiting to do some story Kiama tree lats.  2 / sister and you a question  consider this following reaction if you started with 6 moles.  It's like as soon as I put the slide up eight people clicked in.  Want to bet those eight people are here.  Are you doing that?  And I'll give you another minute on this one.  Okay, we just are ready.  Okay.  Now you have to see what my scantrons look like.  What is the correct answer in the correct answer is?  Beast limiting reagent  if you weren't just simply that's the easy one to figure out because if you go to the store heometry you realize calculation here that point six of B is going to give point to of C-5 of a is going to give .25 of see. So therefore you make less of sea with be there for that must be the limiting reagent. Now you have to do the second calculation, which is how much of a is left over will he do the calculation you realize points for of a is going to be used up?  therefore only point one of its going to be left over again, make sure you know how to do this how to do this kind of a calculation to the correct answer is d  Okay.  go back to  by the way, it was only one really hard question on the exam and that was the A2 B2. That was the molar ratio of the molar mass ratio of a to B. That one was tricky.  There we go. Okay.  radionic equations for acid base reactions again  These kinds of things are pretty straightforward, but let's look for example at strontium hydroxide and perchloric acid. So strong amide Rockside by look or strontium Is strontium hydroxide would BSR  Oh H2O aqueous.  + perchloric acid, which is hclo4.  That's going to give me.  H2O Plus  Sr  clo4 taken twice aqueous  Again, I'm going to need two of these because they were 208 is here when the two of those and I'm going to generate to Waters by go through and do the complete ionic equation and break it down to the net ionic equation. What I realize is my net ionic equation becomes using lowest common multiples o h mine is aqueous.  + H + aqueous  goes to H2O liquid. This is an example of what a neutralization reactions.  This is what a neutralization reactions net ionic equations going to look like no notice. I broke it down if I would have done this and put the coefficients. I would have to be brought the o h - 2 in front of the H+ and two in front of the vh200 because it's a chemical equation. We break it down to lowest common multiple. That's why it comes down to this. I'll let you do the one I'll blow this one. I'm on your own.  Here's an example of an acid base titration is something that you're going to be doing on Friday. You're probably not going to be seeing the color because I don't think we're these phenolphthalein, but we'll figure out whether we are later in the week. Basically. What you doing is you're taking a solution in this case. You're taking a solution that has H+ in here.  it has  08 - in the burette  and when you finish the titration  pH plus is gone.  So what you doing in a titration is it you're adding one of the two components in a very methodical very very controlled manner to react with all of the other substance in there.  How you know that you have enough has to do with something called indicators, which we won't talk about concentration of acid from an acid-base titration.  The standbys NaCl Solution by the way to standardize something means to determine what its actual concentration is 50 ml of HCL is placed in a flask with a few drops of an indicator solution indicator is a is a material that we put in that tells us when the reaction is done. You can think of an indicator is being like a doorbell when the reaction is done Ding Dong the doorbell rings.  Pay but as you might guess.  Indicators have to be picked very carefully not all indicators will work for every acid base reaction. When was going to leave it at that for the time being into a into a beer at his place 1524 molar sodium hydroxide. The initial reading is .55 Mills at the endpoint. The burette reading is 33.87. What is the concentration of the HCL solution K up blank slide. I'm going to ask you to do that one tonight. And then on Thursday, I will actually put that one up we will finish this chapter and we'll start on inner module bit too. I'll see you guys on Thursday. "
