Hopefully it will be your last.  So this is chemistry 4 if you're supposed to be in any other chemistry class, then you're probably in the wrong room. And if you're supposed to be in another chemistry class, I have no idea where you're supposed to be what you guys are the ones you chose camphor because whatever reasons everybody has different reason for choosing Kim for some of your friends in 6A there goes somebody was wrong room some of your friends and six are going to make fun of you for baking camp for ochem Force basic chemistry. That's not all you're just not smart enough to take the 6-series. Some of them are going to give you grief all quarter long until they had quantum mechanics and then they're going to be there going to be having issues Euro gastinel issues.  Most where it's going to start to change is it when your friends in 6A go to 6B next quarter in your n6a you are going to be able to help them with their 6p homework because you are going to know enough by that time come on and find a seat there seats here. Don't be afraid most of the people of shower here.

Are you friend people in 6A who will tell you that they had wish they'd taken camphor instead of starting in the 6-series right away. So you guys are the lucky ones. I choose this class. I don't get assigned. This class is one of the only class  Buses that I teach and I have done it for 14 years 15 years maybe longer than that. It's been a long time.  This is like a once-a-year you guys are the freshest of freshman. I have my own problems to deal with because you are fresh freshman. I have to explain to you things about UCSD. Like for example week 0 only has two days in it is the only quarter that has a week 0 to every other quarter doesn't have a week zero. It starts in week 1 but next week is week one. Next week is my lab starts. Not today not this week not tomorrow so we can weird. There's a lot of weird things. You have to get used to UCSD email addresses talk about the email a little bit later what you can and can't send me in in as attachments in email and stuff there a syllabus is in the back still I think.  There's all kinds of things you have to get used to this place is a weird place to get used to and once you do it's not going to be so bad. Welcome to Kim for what a work you hard. It's going to be a lot of stuff that you are some things you're going to know. There's some people in this class probably should be here but are in the class because they're they're don't have a lot of confidence. That's okay. There are people in this class war here because they had the world's worst high school chemistry teacher if they even had high school chemistry, like the guy who showed movies for a year. Chemistry, okay.  The chemistry is not movies.  CPAC most movies chemistry are just wrong. The only one it's been dumb. Only series ever been any really good as Breaking Bad. That's pretty good. As far as chemistry does trust me. But like when you see somebody throw a bomb like a 55-gallon drum of chloroform over a ship and it floats K. Chloroform is heavier than water. It's not going to float. It's going to sink if the people who were trying to throw their packets of dope over the over the boat new a little chemistry. They would realize plant matter is lighter than water floats. That doesn't sink. Okay. So the bottom line is there's a lot of chemistry in our everyday life now.  I'll tell you more about the tell you about me just a minute. I have been teaching at UCSD for over 20 years. I've been teaching I've been teaching. For over 35 years now. So back that before I came to UCSD to teach full-time. I was doing research at the Salk Institute. I was doing cutting-edge research the kind of stuff. I couldn't even talk to people about because it was so cutting-edge and it was so  quiet couldn't even tell anybody about it because we had to keep it quietly had to keep it quiet. I'm an organic chemist by degree and by training and it's only been with in the even though I've taught organic for years and years and years at UCSD. I've only been teaching organic for maybe six years. I pop a general chemistry sequence and stuff for all most of the time but now they've moved me over inorganic cuz they need a lot of people there. So a lot of you will probably never see me again. And if you do it will be in an organic class, although I think all Donna Summer I teach chem 6C + 6B so you might see me there to take in the summer but I am an organic chemist by training now that qualifies me overly qualified me to teach you General chemistry to get you ready for the general chemistry sequence since I was also the top General chemistry teacher for a while and I helped develop the  Curriculum, and I know what you need to know to survive in the 6 series and the 40 series e organic and that's how I'm always going to roll. My goal is not to get to teach you a selectively set of information that is only going to do you good for this class? My goal is to teach you information that you are going to be able to use in chemistry biology physics in graduate work. If you do it, I'm going to put I'm going to build the foundation for all the rest of your science classes least. That's what I'm going to try to do when I've been pretty good at doing it, but it requires work on your part as well and work on your part means doing all the assignments that we have. So let's go over this by the way is how you going to see me lecture. I don't use the board a lot what you'll see me do is in  You'll see me.  Do things like do things like this if I can?  Find where I'm writing. Sorry, this is a  Hair It Is  so for example, you would see me write something like  on the slide  This is what's called an annotated slide. It's like writing on the board if that's what is exactly like riding on a board. The only difference is that at the end of the week not this week, but most weeks at the end of the week. I upload would have called the annotative slide. So you have the blank slides on your on the web page. You should get them and you should use those give me and you should use those to write on but they're going to be things you miss and things that you miss you can always get from the annotated slide. Now, if you're doing the class if you're in the class and you're so let's say for example, I said something to didn't quite make sense.  It didn't quite make sense when you saw I went when I was talking about it what you can do in your notes.  Some have a little bit of an issue here, but I don't really know why.  What you can do when your notes as you can write something like let's say 8:20. And so you can now go on to the video podcast which is scarce video podcast and you can go to 820 you go 20 minutes in and you can pick up exactly what I was talking about that point in time. So the use of the video podcast is mostly as an adjunct your nose, maybe some some of you I know are the people can sit here and can watch the podcast or can watch the class. But then you want to go home and take the notes off the podcast off the video podcast. That's fine. Some of you like to take notes in here and then use the video podcast of the podcast is a way to enhance those notes. That's fine to what's not so fine is for the people who decide they're not going to haul their rear ends out of bed to come to class.  Enemies podcast I guarantee you. You probably will not be happy with your grade at the end of the quarter. It's just not the way it doesn't work. If you don't engage in the class somehow, you're not going to do very well. I just tell you that right up front and that's going to be true in every class you take in college. So keep that in mind. So it is it a good idea to do this kind of student these kind of things. They kind of keep you the kind of keep you grounded as far as  Aren't they kind of keep you grounded as far as all this kind of stuff goes. So let's go over to the syllabus highlights.  And and look at these, okay.  There we go. Now these are the highlights. Now. I'm going to these are just highlights in the syllabus. You are responsible for reading that monster of a syllabus that you have in front of you. Unfortunately the reason it's that big is because every student  Over the years I've heard every excuse every question. Although I was just given a new question yesterday by somebody I'd never heard before and I put them in the syllabus and if so syllabus is really important. The syllabus is the synonym formal summary. You need to read at your belt syllabus. It is both my contract with you and your contract with me. Now what that means is it is a contract syllabus is a contract if I say in the syllabus at 87% is an A and you have 87% I have to give you an a I can lower that.  Tail light to 85% for example, but I can't raise it to like 88% So you are working off of a contract that says here are here's what I'm going to do and I have to stick to that but at the same time, so do you have to stick to what's in the syllabus if I say no headphones? No graphing calculators on an exam and you have a graphing calculator I can feel you.  So it works both ways. It cuts both ways. It's meant to protect you in some ways. It's meant to protect me in other ways, but it is a contract and you should read through it now. My name is Doctor Carl Hager and that's Hager even though it's spelled the way it is. Please learn how to spell it. Learn how to say it. Trust me if you spell mine and his doctor.  It is Doctor not mr. Sir because you're okay. But you learn to use the right the right arm rific. The bottom line is if I get an email from somebody who's complaining about something in the class in the first thing they've done is misspelled my name.  Trust me. You're lucky if you get a two-word answer from me. Okay, and one of the words that nevermind alright?  So this is camphor again. It is an introduction is called basic chemistry prep cam introduction to chemistry. It has a lot goes by a lot of different names.  again  Sorry, I'm sorry this my program has decided just go Bonkers on me today. So make sure you know how to spell it my office as York 4030 it is right above this classroom on the 4th floor. That's a very important location the fourth floor because that's where your turn in where you going to turn in a lot of stuff for this class on the office hours are on the syllabus that you Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am here rarely the rest of the week. Although I will occasionally be in Friday's. I have a lot of meetings and  You understand. There's a lecture going on and you never walk you in the front of a lecture. You understand that go in find a seat.  How many are you going to do that now? Nobody? Okay.  Because the next time I'll be standing here.  When did like you're just door open and I'll pop in and I'll just Alright by the way don't ever enter the front of a classroom unless you absolutely have to professors don't like that especially when you're 20 minutes late, but you are freshman and I know trying to find places on this campus can be dropped can be tub trouble and I would get I would warn you this.  Make sure if you have time today that you find out where all your classrooms are because there are some some of the questions are really hard to find. I'm sorry, they're so I was assigned to a classroom earlier before in the beginning of the summer. I have no idea where it is. I still don't know where it is cuz they changed it thankfully Triton ad which is which is also I was also goes by for me will use a we will call this. This will be called Ted.  That's what it used to be called. That really came out well.  Let's try this in a different color.  Yeah, that's a little better Ted is Triton dead as a web page you need to have access to that you should have access if your enrolled in the class. If you have just enrolled in the class, sometimes it takes it can take 48 hours for you to get access. But if everything you need like slides experiments and stuff is up there. You're responsible for everything in the syllabus. It's a contract to make sure you look at it come to class even though the class is video podcast because we do have clicker point attendance and performance questions in class. So we use a technology called the iclicker. Most of you have one or I should have have one by now. It looks something like this and of course I'll bet you this is going to be the one that doesn't have the batteries for the batteries don't work. Of course it is.  So let me give you a quick lesson on how to use these things because as it turns out if you don't know how to use it. You've got yourself a little problem going on here. Generally what happens is when you come in.  You will see.  My computer background screen and there will be a question on it. Sometimes if there's no question today, but you'll always see this kind of little bar up here. Okay, so when I click the bar.  It says the frequency is a I'm going to eventually make sure this doesn't show up anymore. And then when I tell if they close it will now accept responses of this leads as to how you use your I clicker. So let me see this young lady's iclicker and you can use it before it's registered. So here is an iclicker. This is the iclicker to the iclicker one works. Similarly someone except for the screen to the first thing you do is turn it on. Okay, that's that button. Are you can see she's already into a a and it will say Kim for eventually and then it'll say ready. Okay, if it says not ready it means you're not in the class. Okay. Now how do you change the frequency? You change the frequency like this hold down this button?  Until the screen flashes, then you set the frequency set the frequency and its case AA it gives you a check mark in the check mark means to think it's set the frequency and this is the frequency that this class is now I'm going to click in if I don't again what you'll see over here is a question. Sometimes I'll do it another way. You'll see a question over here on this screen some of you've clicked it already if there's no question, you can click any letter you want. Okay. So let's say for example going back over to the document camera. Let's say for example that I want to and this is something you have to get used to your used to looking at the television when you use remote control here. You actually need to look at the remote control your iclicker when you're making your click in so let's  Play I want a quickie and let's say the question is is selenium an element. Say a no B. Yes. So watch the screen. I'm going to push B.  And you see it says bee and you get a checkmark, that means two things you were spotted with the letter B, but the check mark is the important one the check mark tells you that your answer was accepted doesn't mean it's right. It means it was accepted by the iclicker system that's important. If you don't get that check mark You're not cooking yet. Okay. So even that would say for example that the person who using this thing decides or when I don't want be I wanted E-Tec a click and now again, he and you get the check mark in it there that sells been accepted.  Can you change an answer in the answer is? Yes, you can change your answer the answer that will be accepted as your final answer is whatever. The last thing you click is before I turn the system off. So for right now, let me ask you all to do this. So we'll come over to this thing here.  Again, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if it sounds like I think you're stupid, but I've had seniors who have come to me at the end of the quarter and go because they've been using it right they turn their iclicker on and they leave that's all they do. It's like okay, that's just that's like wishing your TV to change the channel Cay. All right. Now, here's the question. I'm going to ask you.  If you are male click a if you are female click me.  By the way just clicks away is male bee is female if by the way by the way, just clicking in.  Gives you a tendons for that day whether your answer is correct or incorrect or whether it's just some pits 190 people have clicked in you've been running this thing for a little bit of time. And so now what I can do now, this is all by the way recorded on my computer. So if I then stopped it, okay, I can then  put up this and you can see  the number of males and females in the class. Okay. Now is this a an energy? I don't know what the year is.  David  the  for this question for this question, by the way, so now we know at least if everybody at my clicker, we know 72% of the people in the class of female 27% are male, that's not correct. There's about if I'm if the numbers are usually correct. It's about 50 for 53% female. The rest are males more female ucsd's got more females at Nails. That's something that not till things advertised. But the one thing it's also true about this is that women are more likely to buy their iclickers before the class starts than men, okay.  Men are like yeah. Okay, I'll get it eventually or I forgot it, you know, whatever but in any rate bring your iclicker to class everyday, that's all I want you to guess what I want you to do and the questions I'm going to ask you or not. This is just a simple question to see if you can to see if this how you use it. Now quite often. What I'll simply do is at the end of a question. I will just essential always click out of this thing and then I'll just turn the iclicker on.  And you can click it again. If you want if you're like paranoid about when you click in the first time or not, and then I'll go back over to whatever my lecturing on and it's running in the background. And that's the thing. You always need to know. The iclicker is almost always running in the background so that you can click in.  If you come in late, if you miss a question you missed the question, you can click in and still get a tenant and you should always do that. Always make sure you click in every day. Every time you come you come.  Performance questions or something will start not we probably won't start till the end of next week or the end of or the beginning of week to a performance question would be something like what does the element s? What does the letter s? What is it? What element is SE and I will give you a list and you'll pick the correct answer out of that list will go get some of those and get some of those in a little bit Dozier ones you get performance points for and those are points in addition to attendance points over the course of the quarter. I expect it will have somewhere between 10 and 12 performance questions at least one a week sometimes too. But in general they are questions to see if you're getting the material if you understand the material if you understand adaptations of the material, I'm all quizzes and Labs must be done in the same section of a talk about  That is just a little bit. No words. You can't go to any lab room that you want you are going to be assigned to a lab room and I will talk about that in a minute. And that is the labrum you are going to all quarter long.  So if you're in the morning lab, you'll always be in the morning lab if you're in an afternoon lab you'll always be in the afternoon lab. You can't just go to any room you want you have the same ta  I'm all quarter long at important to keep in mind and that's one of the reasons we do what we also have to balance the classrooms out. And that's another thing that you guys don't really have to worry about. That's my job. But you must do everything in the same. You must be in do everything in the same lab section.  Can you use graphing calculators in here a mole calculator used on exams and quizzes must display English. In other words, you can't have a calculator that is in Chinese Korean German, whatever we had this happen before and first of all only really graphing calculators do that if your calculator can do other languages, you probably can use it in this class. Anyway, the general rule of thumb is if your calculator cost you more than $20, you probably can't use it now as the sick and by the way that's been carrying of the 6-series as well. Usually by the time you get to 6 e professors will relax some of that because the calculations get more difficult, but the problem with graphing calculators is there's a lot of things were spoken with text in it, but I'm more important one is students were using them a scratch pads and that's a problem because they were getting problems wrong because they were  Putting things on paper as soon as I told people you can't just graphing calculator scores in the class went up just because of that mostly because they were forced to put things on paper and they could see their mistakes mistakes became more visible that way so not using graphing calculators is there's there's a reason for it. Usually I tell people that it's a two line calculator is fine like a lot of you have these two line calculators, but just a simple scientific calculators really all you need.  Call let's see next on the agenda here.  I'm all deadlines in this class or what are called drop dead deadlines. In other words once a deadline has been reached its over you don't get a second chance. So you need to keep your eyes on the prize. What is the deadline make sure everything is turned in by that deadline and that includes online stuff. You have so much time to work on things in this class that I just not going to accept anything late.  Now that means that you're going to have to keep up with everything I can you do it. Yes.  thousands of students before you have k  thousands of students before you have you can do it unless for some reason there's a problem with this year's class your UCSD network name or network ID or we called you Ted ID is something that you most of you have sort of worked out what that is, but I want to make sure that you do understand this because it is something that is important. So example my email address.  is  see Hagar at ucsd.edu. This is your network name.  Everything before the app symbol that is a that is a quantity in this class that I use to Aunt to make you Anonymous by and large and to record scores with you need if you get it needs to be used in a number of places. For example, what I want a lot of you to do was to use that network name your Ted ID as your username on mastering Kim, but as some of you figured out there's a whole lot of Joshua Kim's  Are the winds?  Who have been at UCSD who have been on mastering chemistry because mastering chemistry is is worldwide. So people are always freaking I've been freaking I just can't use my number cuz it tells me it's taken and here's the rule folks. As long as you used your UCSD email address.  As the email address that you registered with you don't need to worry about the username.  But if you use your UCSD email address, I have a way of using that to identify you so please don't worry about that. As long as either your username.  In mastering chemistry is your network name or you're using your UCSD ID your golden the problem is if everybody in the class uses whatever they want hot AZN 101 which by the way is a real at that has been I've had that more than one more than once as a real as a real email address except not at UCSD. It's in Hotmail or something like that. The bottom line is it becomes very difficult to track you down and then and in a class of 350, I don't have a lot of time to do that kind of stuff at the end of the quarter. So pleased as long as one of you as long as you used one of those you're going to be okay the general grading and point distribution 6 out of 7 lab reports 50 points for lab report 300 points lab reports are that you if you you should have got gone to the bookstore and bought a packet that packet cost about  Box, I think they were out of them, but they're reprinting the make sure you have that packet before next Friday that has in it all of the worksheet all of the lab reports you turn in now there's a second component to lab and that's the actual experiments. Actually what's in that packet of prelabs the lab report in post lab questions or get turned in separately. By the way, what's not in there are the experiments themselves and I did this to keep the cost down. The experiments are on our trade nude beige. You should download them and print them. You don't really have to but you need to be able to read them in at least one person in your group in your lab group should have them printed out before you go into the lab. You really don't want to bring your laptop's into the lab.  Your iPad your iPhone's your Samsung whatever the heck they have now because if you spill something on it chemicals do not like electronic devices very much and it will ruin it. So don't bring them into the lab. It's just not safe and you really should get in the habit of think printing these things out. What you can do is you can put them on if you can put the experiments on a flash drive and you can we'll go over to imprints the printing place and they can actually or you can do it yourself can actually printed from your flash drive. So that is one that's one way around of experiments are up to some of the experiments are up. Usually the way I work it is that I put I put a Viper only experiments up recently or the beginning of a quarter so you could download them in a printer at home, but what I'm going to do  Is every week I'm going to like that weeks experiment up because there's other things in the experimental that you need. There are videos that are going to be in there. There are sometimes extra explanations. I'm going to light this week's up and then the week the previous week's ones will go out. Usually Wednesday afternoon. Usually Wednesday afternoon sometime so you can always expect the first experiment to be up about a week ahead of time. Next Friday is our first leather is no lab tomorrow, so don't come  There won't be anyone there. Okay.  You don't need your lab coat until next Friday. You actually really don't need it until the following Friday.  But after that no lab coat no admission to lab.  Hey.  Lab coats and I'll talk about them to talk about the safety in a minute lab coat, you can decorate any way you want but they have to be lab coats and they have to come up to your wrists.  You can't have one of these little short like I think I'm a doctor lab coat. Yeah.  They're separate lab coat you get anywhere. You want Amazon?  Walkthrough hallway in the in the school of medicine, whatever you can find it somewhere if you're listening to this at Berkeley, we do not Advocate stealing lab coats.  It's if if you have a friend now some of you how many of you are built for anybody you need to be particularly careful because they have you let them walk your day there. You have to wear lab coats there. They will lock your lab coats up and you might not be able to get it on Friday. So you got to remember to take it home to take it out of the lab to make sure you have it for your for your rabbit for your for your chem four laps. This is was an issue last year something to keep in mind ya.  Play me, whatever you want with those. You just can't you must use what you bought from. The books are you can't photocopy than yourselves? You can have one friend by it and then you all photocopying can't do that. That's not happening by it. It's not that expensive. You can pay you can spend six bucks. Okay, just don't buy to Starbucks a week by going by the coffee. They have over in the  Choke and puke here. All right.  All right to worksheet Labs 1 worksheet loud is a very first one which is the math lab someone you should all start being struck should be working on it's done at home only is is a lot of it's a lot of reading about sign about scientific notation about all that kind of stuff and then you actually do you actually have questions to answer and you turn in that's in the lab bag of what you turn in we just put your answers down. Then the thing is that is getting you used to doing dimensional analysis that something that's not going to be due until week too. So you have a lot of time to do it. You have a whole you have this weekend plus next week and half of the week the next week to do it, but don't wait until the very end start working on that. Now the last worksheet lab is the last lab of the of the quarter which is a Lewis structure lab. Please keep that in mind that that's coming that'll be in there. All those are in there.  Those are done at home and then they're turned in either in the laboratory or somewhere where I'll tell you to turn them in. There are six pre lab exercise has their Five Points each. That's a total of 30 points in those are in the lab packet that you buy are there are four procedural outlines and for discussions the pages for putting those on are in your stat lab packet those don't start. There's only selected experiments and they don't start until I think week for week 3 or week 4 and a procedural outline is just essentially getting used to the idea of sitting down and writing what you're going to do in the experiment before you do the experiment. You have 6 post lab question that says 10 points for each a total of 60 points. Those are more objective kind or more objektiv kinds of questions where some aspect of what you learned in the lab is applied.  To a different kind of principle to a different situation for example in the empirical formula lab will determine the empirical formula of zinc iodide by experiment post lab questions. Will have you determine something else by giving you data or for example, ask you a question, like what could have gone wrong if this happened? So post lab questions are to get you to think about what you did in the lab and what it means there are two in class midterms or a mixture of question types or 150 points each. Those are in this room and they're in the syllabus there in week 4 in and week 8 if I remember correctly, but there are the dates are in the syllabus.  Those are those start at 8 sharp and you have an hour and 20 minutes to do them. Again. It's there. They are true exams it for all intents and purposes. The nomenclature quiz is going to be sometime toward the middle of the quarter sometime like week for week 5 and you're going to do that in the very beginning of lab. I will give you one assignment to start right now. I want you to learn the names and the symbols of the first 86 elements in the periodic table.  But you don't have to memorize the periodic table. Okay, but you should know that c is carbon K is potassium that kind of stuff. That's all you need to know symbol and name, okay.  You should also start soon looking at the nomenclature module will talk about modules in a minute online mastering chemistry homework is with is worth 50 points. It's essentially almost a free 50 points if you do the homework.  Attendance participation 45 points 15 for attendance and the remainder 25 or the remainder Z28 for tenants in 25 for a performance question in the final exam is comprehensive at 300 a midterm exams start at 8 and go to 9:20. No make makeup exam Inquisitor. Not given grades are based on total points on occasionally is happening almost every year depending on how students do you want exam 1 exam to get for example, we're having a particularly bad year sometimes what I do is I will modify the grading scheme for your final exam.  Final exam always counts, but your final exam can also replace one of your midterm scores the weather I do that or not will depend on how people do on examone an exam to and that decision once made will be put up on Ted and I'll talk about it in class. It is always for the benefit of the students anytime. I modify the grading scheme and as always for your benefit for nothing else and that's something you should always realize that's my number one goal is and I'm going to buy change a grading scheme. It's going to be to benefit you not to be able to get more season the class OK it's mostly to be able to give people who have low scores get their grades up because I had a bad exam got a bad example. You were sick on the midterm 2  Gang should you be punished for that? No, okay.  But this kind of stuff happens will work those kind of things out as we go along.  Something thank goodness. You can't see the things popping up on my screen.  Yes, there's every once in awhile. I get a text from somebody. It'll  I don't know. I don't work the screen to see if you guys can see it. The homework is Hagar Kim for fall 18 at is the mastering chemistry homework. If you have a problem with go to Ted and read that thing I put up there about the homework because there's a link and some people can't get the link to work. But there's a second link I put in there and almost always works. If you have a problem with mastering chemistry contact their support staff. They are very good and they will help you.  I can't somebody said can you change this for me? I can't do anything. I have no control over that website for their site now lab room assignments personal lab packet is at the bookstore. They did run out of them because they spend this class. They should be making more of them and I might her standing as they should be available tomorrow or next week sometime in the beginning lab room assignments now when you signed up for this class  You signed up for either an AM lab or a p.m. Lab am being the 9 to 11:40 class and the PM being the one to 3:40 class. You also was signed into a room. Now, what you need to know is that I need to rebalance. The number of students in the rooms are there is always a mess up on this. So what's going to happen is this  On Triton add on your web page. There is something called my gradebook.  It is there's nothing in there right now.  But sometime this weekend or Monday.  I am going to redistribute students to different classrooms that you might be in the same classroom. You've been a sight you what you signed up for but you might be in another one. The one thing it's not going to change that if you're in a nine lab you always going to be in a 9 lab. If you're in a 1 Lab, you're always going to be in the 1 Lab, but you might be in a different room when I'm going to put up on Ted is what classroom what laboratory room you have been assigned to.  Some of you are going to be moved.  I think this affects the afternoon people more than the morning people, but I'm not sure I'm going to do that this weekend. I need to get Parker the Tas I need to assign Tas the lab rooms another issue that comes up. So please watch your emails.  Watch your emails from me and read Ted read the announcements on Ted. It'll tell you when it's been posted in addition to that. Next Friday. I will put on the door each laboratory who is in what lab in the morning and who is in what lab in the afternoon she could always look there but no one but look on Ted before you will make sure you know that before you get there. I'm not going to change it. Once I put it up there deadlines are returning things in our drop-dead deadline to make sure you don't miss them curves are applied only at the end of the course and there are Curves in this class. The average class average is what I used to determine what the average grade what what the grades in the class are and generally speaking the class average income for usually translates into a B minus C plus Inlet.  You guys are all freaking Geniuses in which case it'll be higher, but I doubt not that I doubt you. That's experience stalking. Okay?  You know how many student anybody want to guess how many students are taught?  About 35,000 students. That's an estimate. By the way on the low side. What I've learned over that is that I can make predictions about grades. I can make predictions about students pretty much without making very many mistakes. So when I talk about this or that usually what I mean is that in the past, this is what I found so I expect what I expect in here is that you guys going to be like every other class I've had where the average in the class in chem for is going to be somewhere in about the 60 65% range, maybe a little bit lower but I use the class average depending on what the average grade in the class is an income for that whines up being about a B minus C plus brighten at ballpark.  Camphor because there's so many points coming in and because people do very well in the labs in the labs make up a significant amount of your points. There is hard to get people tired of lower rates and I don't like the law so the bottom line is always ask what the average was in the class. I'll always tell you where ever you exam and you can base where you sit in the class according to that. When do you need to start worrying? You need a really worried for his exams go?  When you are 20 percentage points below the class average, then you need to start asking me am I going to pass this class? Am I? Okay. The answer is almost always here. Now. The reason is because the laptop you don't do Labs pass class. Labs are like free points. It's like walking down the street and are pennies everywhere. He won't pick them up and then all of a sudden there's no more Pennies on the ground. Okay, but the people behind you've been picking up those pennies and now they've got tens and twenties of dollars you have Butkus.  Okay pennies are worth picking up. Okay, all points little points here little points their help you over also. Please keep that kind of stuff in mind lab adjustments.  Are Justin to only have the same section? This doesn't usually happen. I don't usually have to do this anymore.  Because typically what happens is I have graders grading the labs and let me put it this way. Let's say for example one greater is particularly harsh with respect to how they grade the labs for that particular for that particular section and one greater is particularly easy. I am not going to punish the people who had a harsh grader.  By having them will have a lower score. I'm not going to elevate those people at an easy grade. What I'm going to do is normalize them so that every section has the same average.  And I do this at the end of the quarter it works very very well. I haven't had to do it recently because my graders have been pretty much all online as far as what I want them to do. But if there are discrepancies between averages I will fix I will fix those only really in sections. It's only really in Labs. It just becomes an issue. I'm class averaging class grade ever an average grade of talked about no phones or smart devices allowed on your person during exams quizzes are in the laboratory specially on exams and quizzes. You cannot have your phone out. You really should be in your backpack. No smart devices. You can have a graphing calculator, but he can't be smart. The only smart part of a graphing calculator is what's connected to your  Hand your fingers in your brain. Okay in the IT world in Information Technology, there is a term called hubcap. Okay, and you never want to be pebkac pebkac stands for problem exists between chair and keyboard.  Cana what's between the chair and the keyboard you  That's where most of the problems come up, you know, you can't smart device doesn't help that much, but it can give you an edge and I don't want other people to have I don't want you to have them in the laboratory because I don't if you're texting in the lab.  I'm going to ask the TA is to throw you out of the lab. And once you're throwing have a lab you're not back in.  You got a zero for that experiment. You shouldn't be texting in the lab. It's distracting and that's when experiments at sorry. That's when problems happen and problems in a laboratory.  Can go from bad to worse in a heartbeat.  That's something we don't want happen. In addition to that. Think about how much you or your mother or father pay for your phone.  Okay.  And then ask yourself. What is Mom and Dad going to say if I told them that I ruined my thousand-dollar phone by dropping it?  Into a beaker of sulfuric acid because I was texting my boyfriend girlfriend, whatever about meeting me for lunch dinner or whatever.  The not going to be happy trust me. My daughter Trump dumpster dropped her phone in toilet. Once I was not happy I said how on Earth is this happen and head under my arm and it's okay. That's enough Kia by okay.  All right, please don't bring up this just put them in your backpack. Once you leave the class what you leave though. It's okay to do be doing it then cheating academic Integrity dolci. I will catch you if I catch you your life as you know, it will probably be over Kim for schedule. I want to point this out.  This week there is no Lab at the MacBook. The the math worksheet should be started at home. Okay, next Friday. The very first experiment is the densities of common substances. You notice it says math worksheet as well. The only reason I put that in there is is next week's experiment the very first experiment recovery introduction to what's in the laboratory how to use the equipment in the laboratory. It's also a time when you can ask the TA for for help on your math worksheet, but your math worksheet is not going to be due until the following Thursday and I'll talk about those deadlines and just a little bit the safety quiz will be posted.  sometime  this weekend and you have only one chance to take it if you fail it. I can kick you out of camphor.  .  Okay. So what it means is it when you if you read the safety materials, if you watch the safety video I have up on the web and you do that all before you take the safety quiz, you're going to be fine. You're allowed to miss. I have to get a 70% on it. You're allowed to miss I think four questions and it's not that it's not that hard. It's not that hard in the past years in past years.  I for 10 years.  I had hundred percent Pass rates in camphor for the safety for the safety quiz in The Last 5 Years.  I have had.  More and more people fail it and most of it's because they simply aren't reading the stuff. They're not they're just basically taking it that I can just take it again what they going to do. Kick me out of class. Yes, Siam.  k  Trust me.  I am like your worst nightmare.  on steroids  Don't mess with me.  Can I don't?  40000 students  you think I can't handle you?  Okay, really freaking baseball bat my office don't make me use it.  I used to coach softball. That's why I have a baseball bat in my office. All right, do you have to have the same sequence finish by Friday next Friday, not tomorrow, but next Friday by 8 a.m. Please. When you do this don't do it at the last minute and be sure that you have a good stable connection because if your connection drops out you will fail and we have that happen and don't be going back and forth. I know people I know what I'll do. I have two tabs open and I'll go back and forth. Ted will kick you out. If you do that. Anyway exam, we do the density of common of common substances and then when are Labs going to be do well generally if a if an experiment is done here?  Generally, it's due the next week on Thursday and you'll see this in a minute. So that work the math worksheet and experiment one are due.  In week 2 which is the week of October 8th. Okay. Talk about that in just a moment. You notice where the exams are exam. One is Thursday, October 25th coverage today 8 exam 2  Examone is in.  a week for exam  2 is in is Tuesday of Thanksgiving week.  That way you can get the exam done. You can go home for Thanksgiving and with the worried about studying it over studying over the week over the holiday. Basically, it works out well for all of us as far as this goes put those down the class will start at beginning of classical go in till 9:20 there in 3rd. Thanksgiving has no lab obviously and there's no class on Thanksgiving following week is a Lewis structure and Vsepr worksheet. So the last wet experiment we do is the volumetric analysis in titration and then week 10. It says check out checkouts. Not really. Really. We don't do anything and check-out week. What happens is in check-out week. What happens is  That that's where you can go and pick up any labs that you haven't picked up yet from the Tas. That's where if you don't want to come to Avenel just don't come it's basically a chance to talk to your Tia's if you want and it's really a time to sort of collect yourself and get ready for your final exams. The schedule is rough as to what we cover. The modules is o'brate broken up into module says you'll see as you as you might have seen already. I'm we may not cover all of them. For example, we may not cover the the entry module the heat and energy. Sometimes I flip them around but the bottom line is all the information about what we're going to do is in this is in this occasionally we have occasionally we have had in the fall we have had problems when they're Spitfires and you in San Diego where they had to shut down the university for a couple days. We had those kind of issues come up. Hopefully that won't happen this year.  So we make the schedule a little bit flexible, but there are some things that you can do at home. The final exam is Tuesday December 11th from 8 at 8 a.m. It goes from 8 to 11. It is 3 hour exam. Although it generally doesn't take anybody 3 hours to do it.  This is the modular. This is the idea of modules modules is something I've been experimenting with and I'll explain it to you like this.  The way I want to treat camphor is almost like a hybrid class in the sense that there is lecture there is in class lecture and there is also out of class material awful online with your stuff you have to do that's what the modules are all about. There are two types of modules are what are called SS modules self-study and they're what are called partial self-study PSS a self-study module is a module or anything in that module is something that I will not talk about in class. You are responsible for it on your own.  Okay. Now does that mean I'm not going to talk about it? No, what usually means is that I am going to give you a quote value-added lecture where I'm going to talk about more complicated things. I'm going to talk about how Stoichiometry applies to a bigger picture. I'm going to talk about more in depth about those self study modules a partial salt self-study module is where part of the material in a PSS. I'm going to talk about in class, but the rest of it you'll be responsible for on your own or for example, you'll be responsible for looking at it. And then when you come to class I'll go through more detail more chemically. I'm oriented studies. For example significant figures and measurement that's a PSS.  Okay, what that means is that I will mention things about significant figures in measurements, but most of the material in that you're going to learn on your own to the module the online lectures that you have.  Dimensional analysis is a self-study module. And so what I'm going to do in class is I'm going to assume that you watch to self study module and I will do dimensional analysis problems show you how to apply dimensional analysis to more complicated kinds of system to real chemistry types of systems real physics types of systems Amber other ones atoms and periodic table you noticed that's neither a PSS nor an SS. That's one where everything I will talk about Ian about that. I will talk about you in the in the lecture again, all of the PSS and SSS modules are up on the Triton webpage in the self-study the module section there. They always consists of annotated slides and a video so you can watch the video and follow along on the annotated slide. They came out of a real lecture, so they're not  Made up kinds of things.  Again, if you have any questions about this, you can talk to me about it and we'll go through it in more details. You can be expected asked you can be expected to be ass performance questions to see whether you've actually done the self study module or the PSS. I'll ask you some question that will be able to be answered if you've done it.  Sometimes on SS and PSS South say hey anybody have any questions or let's look at this problem. How would you solve and for example, I'll take things from the classes people, you know, try to tell me. Oh, yeah, I would do this first. Okay, that doesn't work. Why won't it work and that's a big thing. You got to understand it. If you ask me a question. I'm going to ask you.  How would you do it?  And you might not like that. I don't really care. The bottom line is you only learn if you have to think about a problem. I can do every problem in his class.  I need you guys to be able to do that. And so I will ask you how would you do this now? I don't want you to think you're being put on the spot because you're not I want you to give me the logic of how you think you should approach that problem. If you are wrong, I will say that won't work. Can you give me a reason why and I might ask the rest of the class or somebody else has to come up. Is there a reason that won't work and here is the reason I do it because if you know why something won't work, you'll never make that mistake a second time.  And it's really important in science that you learn. You never learn from your successes in science. You learn only from your failures.  And I can guarantee you that is a truth of life.  You never learn from when you've been successful.  You only learn when you had to struggle when you've had to maybe something didn't work any other find a way to make it work. That's part of why I do what I do and it works and it doesn't work. Trust me. So you should have questions ready for those kind of days as well.  Pacific whale policies now this is sort of a I'm going to summarize some things here. This is a lot of this is in the video, but I want to go through it right off lab starts promptly if you come 10 minutes late.  Or more you're going to receive a zero for that lab and you're not going to be allowed to do the lab. I'm going to tell the Tas to make sure that if nobody if the if somebody comes after 10 minutes, they're done. They're gone. They don't and there's no arguments. I'm not going to overturn ETA.  Okay, so make sure you get to the class in time. Make sure that your direct that you're dressed correctly as well. There are pre lab videos and podcast they're going to be on the web page for most experiments. They must be due to listen to before doing the pre lab quiz. And before you went to the lab they give you an idea of what you're doing and what to look for what kinds of pitfalls you might run into pre lab exercise in quizzes must be done before you went to the lab. You hand them actually deertier. You must have your data signed off by your ta before you leave the lab unsigned a Tour results 04 that lab the TA will only have to initial the front page the very first page of your data collection.  At what that means is that is a proof that you were in the lab and it's a proof that the day that you have and that you're working with is what the TA is what you took in that lab that's important to do you must sign the bottom of each page of your laboratory report and your data sheet. You can sign it or you can initial it. I'd like you to get the habit of signing it it is scientifically it's something that you learn how to do in the lab in a lab in in research it is when you sign the bottom of a webpage you are saying I did this work and this is the data I collected and it makes it a legal document. So it's not that I'm going to take you to court on your lab reports, but it's something you want to get in you want to get in the habit of doing copying of experiments and that includes data if you weren't in the lab.  If you copy an experiment or you copy data.  Will result in the initiation of an academic Integrity proceedings that will result with an F in the course as well as suspension from school.  Okay, in other words if you just couldn't make it to lab take the zero like a man or a woman don't copy someone's data because we find out and we will someone will knock you out.  Now in the laboratory one of you is always going to be collecting the data for your group that copying is okay, but it must be done in the laboratory. You have to be in the laboratory to get that data. So it's okay if one person is taking a date and then the rest of the lab team you were going to be working in groups of three or four copies of data from that. That's okay, but it has to be done in the lab. I'm all safety requirements must be followed all time these include but are not limited to safety goggles are required to work in the lab. Now, we do provide you with safety goggles. But here's a question. You want to ask yourself look at the person next to you and ask yourself. Would you put something on your face?  Did they had just had on theirs?  Now it turns out if you don't want to if you don't want if I mean you clean them, obviously if you want to buy yourself a set of lab lab goggles there for sale up in York 40.  20  For today tomorrow and then a couple days and I think until Wednesday of next week for $8 or something like that and they're pretty good ones. If you don't want to buy them, that's fine. Eventually you're going to need them. So if you want to invest in if that's okay, but there's no need to we do provide those lab coats are required that we don't provide for you. You do need to buy your own lab coat, you're not very expensive. You can get a used lab coat, that's fine. The only requirement of a lab coat is it they must be knee-length and completely cover the arms or the red or the rift. They have to cover up to hear. Okay, and I said, you can't wear one of these like little buff coats it look like, you know, you're up chiropractor something. You got to have a real lack of it look like a scientist. Okay. Now I know for some of you I mean some of the short people in the class and we've had some really  Who were the lab coat looks like a dress? Okay, that's okay. Sometimes it's hard to find like if you really big guy. It's hard to find a lab coat or big woman. It's hard to find a lab coat because all the way down to your wrist. Try to get one that gets down there as close as possible the rule of thumb we use is this I don't want to see any skin.  From your neck to the bottom of your feet any skin that showing will get you kicked out of the lab. Okay?  Long pants card crew neck shirts and covered top shoes are required. Now. The rule of thumb for shirts is first of all, we don't want you wearing plunge cut stuff man, or woman. No not in the lab k your shirts should cover up to like right there, you know, like a typical t-shirt kind of thing. Now, you're the lab coat on so obviously this is not as big of a deal the plunge cut part is but we do we do like you if possible to have sleeves down to there. No, we're not going to throw you out a laugh for that kind of stuff would just make you brighten your lab coat up more. The thing is all of this is layering if some spills on your lab coat you want to make sure that you would layered so it doesn't get down to your skin.  Covered top shoes are required. You must wear socks. You cannot have ankles showing. If you have skin. If you have your ankle showing skin, you're going to be asked to leave the lab. Okay, so wear socks your shoes has become a bone of contention for students. What kind of shoes can you wear? Well, these are fine tennis shoes. As long as they're covered on the top. You're okay. You can't wear sandals. You can't wear Crocs and you should be wearing Crocs. Anyway, you you can't wear ballet slippers. Okay, you got to ask yourself this question if I were to take a beaker of concentrated acid and pour it on your foot.  Would you?  The shoes you're wearing what they protect you long enough to get them off.  The answer is if the answer is no.  You're not willing to drop a hammer.  on your foot  then you shouldn't be wearing those shoes. You could always ask me if you want to see we don't we have a thing about skinny jeans. Let me just put it this way for those of you who like to wear.  Like those jeans or whatever. They look like spray on you come spray on jeans, you know that the Lycra kind of like stick to you. Like I'm hot yoga kind of person don't wear those the lab because all that does is it brings the chemical right into into contact with your with your body so bad thing. You can't smoke eat or drink in the lab.  Yeah, just don't horseplay is forbidden in the lab metal would still be playing grab-ass with the person next to you. I don't have to rise to experiments or not permitted obviously.  The safety of safety glass slide and then we'll be done here.  Again, you should read this but here's where I here's the part that I want to go over with you right now.  Deadlines, okay.  The pre lab is due on the day of the lab.  As you enter the lab your hand to your ta the procedural outline is due on the day of the lab. As you enter. The lab of the Tas will tell you more about whether they're going to collect it or whether you're going to use it in the closet in the lab or not. But it's do think of it as being due on the day of the lab when you walk in lab report sheets are Thursday after the lab at the turn in station by noon to turn in station is going to be in front of the bathrooms on the 4th floor right above us.  K-30 plastic bins each bin has at EA's name on it. You put your material your you put your turn in stuff there post lab questions. You give Friday in lab at the beginning of lab to your ta so pre lab procedure outline post lab and discussions all are given to your ta discussion is following Friday after the lab was done its due when you enter the lab. So typically the way it works is this experiment is done.  the next week  on Thursday the experiment the experimental of the experiment worksheet sardou on Friday the procedure outline discussion if we discuss this experiment and the post lab questions, or do I keep all of this in mind, this is something is something you should write on your calendars again in the very beginning of the class starts. I will tell you I will keep reminding of what you when things are done our due. Please keep this in mind. All right, that's enough for the day anybody if there any syllabuses in the back, please bring them down to front. I'll see you guys next Tuesday. We will start talking about significant figures. "
