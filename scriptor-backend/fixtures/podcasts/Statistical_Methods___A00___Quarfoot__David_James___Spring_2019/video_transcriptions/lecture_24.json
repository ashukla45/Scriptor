    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back. Are you ready to up the ante in life?  If you can handle one proportion, I hope you can handle two.  It's just more notation. That's it. So we're going to study two populations. We did this with means and we saw the things got a little complicated formulaically and the same things going to happen here, but it's going to be okay. Now the important thing is you're studying the same idea and these two worlds.  And you care about some proportion related to this idea what percentage of people own a home for example and maybe population one is California and population two is, Oregon.  Not in the past. Sometimes I've given you two worlds, but I would completely summarize one of them so we didn't actually need a sample from it. So today we're going to sample from two places at the same time. So don't compare these p-values. Who knows. I'm calling the P1 and P2 to help. Keep track now.  So when you draw sample from each you can go talk to your people in each sample and figure out if they identify as the trait you care about and then you can find the sample statistics P1 haat P2 hat. The other cool thing is we don't need the same size sample and each so we'll keep track of how big each sample was. Sometimes it's easier to sample from one population than it is another because of financial costs or local regulations or something like that.  Okay. So now we have to statistics and two sample size is helping us estimate two parameters because it's so slick why not use it twice. So instead of thinking about two separate worlds that needs can be whatever they want or we can do subtract the Two Worlds and now we just have one varying idea instead of two. Okay. So when you take P1 - P2 or vice versa the order is irrelevant.  Now you just have to study one object that fairies not has two pieces that make it up that very so it is slightly complicated. But the cool thing is if you can just figure out what's going on with the difference then you understand what's going on with what you care about usually  Okay. So anyone that wants to see if he wants bigger than P2 would be hoping for a different Sims positive.  Now all we need to do here is try to study this object P1 hat - P2 hat because we can't get it P1 and P2 directly, but we can't study what would happen if you go collect a sample and see what's going on in that. So we're going to learn how to build see eyes and Ross going to run hypothesis tests. Now the most common hypothesis test says the P1 P2 or that their difference is 0 it is possible to have different values than zero here. It's just very rare. You can ask a question. Like, you know, does Pete buttigieg have three more points of popularity than Bernie Sanders would be very weird question. You've decided the number 3 for some reason this the difference between the two worlds.  But it does happen but for us most of the time we'll look at the value zero there now. Here's where you have to let your mind stimulate.  So what we need to do is Imagine drawing a sample from each population imagine finding the statistic P1 or P2 hat and that's one value that we could have got.  They just came from our particular sample. Now. If you repeat this process many many times, that's how you get the sampling distribution, which shows you the picture of everything that P 1/2 could do and everything with P to hack. Could you now we know from what we did the other day that P1 hat on average if you write a review of P1 hat and use Mew like an expected value operator.  Then we know that nature wants to give us things near the truth.  But there's going to be some variation in what Piedmont hat can be and that's what the standard error captures. So the world on the left is completely summarized with a normal distribution with Center P1 and spread P 1 Q 1 / N1 with a square root on it. And the same thing is all true over on the right side of the slide, right?  So what happens when you take?  The blue Universe on the left and subtract from it the blue Universe on the right. That's what we really want to study. If you want have - P2 hat what goes in the center of the slide just like we had for me.  Okay, so someone tell me your emotional guess on where P1 hat - P2 hat would be centered.  What is it expected value?  I heard the answer is 0 this is a great answer if you believe P. 1 equals p 2  But do it without using that assumption for me.  Is a P1 - P2 good so that's simply what's going on. Like if this world wants me to number P one in this world wants to be P2 When you subtract them it wants to be the differences of those ideas. Now the standard error how spread out  something complicated  something something formulas. Okay. Another question is what curve does approximated what happens when you subtract two normal distributions?  You could a disaster know you get something nice turns out it's a normal normal distributions is one of the values of the normal distribution the common operations you do to it. Keep it within its own family. This is not true of all distributions out. There is something you prove in like a 180 a class and initially centering or the average expected value of the difference is just a difference of the averages you saw this with the expected value formula expected value of x minus y is just the difference of the expected values.  Now the spread out is you need to go back to the variance formula. So first focus on variance, you know, the variance in the difference of two things is always just the sum of the variances if the two random variables are independent.  So what we study here will be two worlds that are independent of each other if the world somehow dependence uncomplicated way then the formula I'm about to rights. Just not true.  And then you have to use a different infrastructure to solve something like that. So the standard deviation of a difference is just the square root of the variance.  Now we decided the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances and the variance is just the standard deviation squared. So what this does is it allows you to study how spread out a differences by pulling it back to the spread out nuses of the two worlds, which I'm calling X and Y here for the moment.  They're going to be P1 hat in P2 hat. Okay. So here's how spread out P1 hat is \u221a P1 if you want over and one he too has the same idea to just take those block them in here you square them and then you bring it down and you do the same thing with the p two ideas.  Now the black square root gets dissolved by the black to the squaring things the red square root just sits there and everything outside of all of the excitement.  So if you want to know how spread out.  the universe of P 1/2 - p 2hat is  finish is the square root of the sum of the idea is going on in each of the individual things exactly have this memorized but I have memorized you figure this out by recalling some sort of variance formula that we know from our past and I have memorized what's going on in an individual population when you study proportion and then my brain just reproduces. This is better than just memorizing a bunch of symbols all over the page.  Yasso in life. If you focus on the memorization of the derivation, this will usually take you forward further in life than just memorizing the formula cuz then you're learning why things are true.  And you have the ability to read arrive it better if you just memorize a series of symbols. There's no hope and read arriving it. So if you go to like the memory Championship the world memory championship and you see how people like how do you memorize a deck of 52 cards as fast as possible with greatest accuracy?  So people build these stories around the cards that are flying out them, you know, so the first three cards they imagined there in some room of a mansion and they've memorized each card maps to a certain object and they tell a story like a night is holding a Candlestick while waving to a pony and night Candlestick and pony map to certain cards that they've done in advance before they show up. So it's easy to memorize that kind of thing Andre Drive the whole deck of cards that way rather than just trying to memorize three of Spades. So on through universes, I'll get some crazy distribution that's normal sentir to P1 - P2 with this complicated spread out in this and this is all we need. This is the infrastructure now to build confidence interval. This is a test.  Should we try?  Okay.  Maybe we'll try so I recently added this problem into the slide because I realized we never really talked about medical things and this is one of those common settings where you actually go use statistics.  So some of you probably use Listerine.  You may not know it's named after Joseph Lister.  Who was one of the people that pioneered the importance?  Estero station so back in the old days you got surgery and they needed to say cut off your arm.  They would just take an Axe and just cut off your arm and there would be no sterilization anywhere in the process. No one would wash their hands. No one who clean off the ax because they didn't realize they're these tiny little things living everywhere that cause damage called bacteria, but one day Lister decided, you know what we're going to try some amputations, but we're going to use carbolic acid to drop everything in their first OK and turns out that to sterilize her. Okay. So of those 40 people guess what things went. Well 34 survived not even a good survival rate in today's times but back then a great survival rate.  I mean imagine being a Game of Thrones like  have to chop off your arm. You're probably going to die. He probably going to get infection. Anyhow, they also did 35 without carbolic acid is hard to get away with in today's times and not many people survived. So let's try to make a 95% CI but here it's complicated words for it's in the difference of the true proportions. If you could put everyone in the world through each of the different scenarios and figure out what happens proportionally in terms of survival and subtract those two ideas. So with and without carbolic acid,  So first thing we'll see if you can give me some variables.  What is it? We actually want to study. What do they mean in words when notation are you going to put on them?  So I'm hoping to see the letter P on your page not Mew this isn't about means. I'm hoping to see two different subscripts. I don't care what you call them. Then I'm looking for a word like percentage of proportion. And then I'm looking for something that feels population a huge complicated. Okay amputation patients that survive instruments sterilized with carbolic acid. There's no mention of a particular sample is if you put everyone through this ever.  Now this is an example of something you could never get the population proportion because you have to take everyone and amputate something on them. You're probably not going to get away with that, right?  Well, not in America, maybe in some other country. I don't know you just do whatever you want.  What expression do we want to build a CI for?  now when you do this  You need to know we're going to subtract the two population parameters.  Because it's the easiest infrastructural Lee. We have an infrastructure for it. Actually now doesn't matter what order you choose here. Now, some people choose the order that they believe is probably going to create a positive idea if you think carbolic acid and sterilizing things is a good thing in life than the proportion that survive should be bigger than if you don't  okay, but is it matter if you just flip everything the whole problem gets reversed on signs but so does the interpretation of it. So it all Dances all come out the same so I don't care which order you choose but if you want to know what I'm going to tend to choose when I'm reading the answer key if your goals from match my ordering  Now, you know that I try to get positive ideas out of my differences, but you can always be wrong in that maybe carbolic acid makes things worse may be pouring Clorox or something and then dipping it into the human body. I could be bad right but notation on the numbers that came out of this problem.  So you may notice I'm forcing you to slow down here and spend a lot of time in the initial setup stages. Most people will be totally fine. Once we get past the set of stages because you're in college which means you've already met the threshold of can I push things into formulas people that don't go to college have trouble making that transition, but I know everyone's copy down the formulas that are going to happen in the moment, but can you understand that this population parameters that their sample statistics? Can you put the right notation on them? You should have hats on what's going on right now. This is how you distinguish the fact that you're living in the sample. We got 85% in our sample, but that may not be true of all people if you put them through the carbolic acid simulation.  Okay, and subsea and some end.  I feel weird to you.  Like a Yoshi riding a Yoshi.  But that feel weird and iterative.  I saw this rom hack recently where the main character is Yoshi, but then you have to ride a Yoshi in it, cuz it's based on Super Mario World and it freaks everybody out the first time they see baby Yoshi on Father Yoshi. Anyhow, and so bend. Okay next.  I haven't given it to you, but can you dream up with the confidence interval? Formula should be in this setting based on your extensive experience building confidence intervals in life.  First try to give me a formula with letters and then if you want to go push some numbers through it.  Confidence interval formula is always look like your best guess for the parameter trying to estimate. What year is the difference plus or minus?  Some sort of critical value based on whatever distribution models. This idea here to normal distribution times has spread out the universe is that you're trying to study so here it's the spread out and rest of the difference in the two sample proportions. Okay, so we have some let's see if you can find SE for what's going on in this problem.  Your answer should be a number.  calculator  WIC formula on the previous slide used phrases like P1 P2 q1 Q2 or heater subscription with season ends.  We don't have those the whole point of the problem is to study them or figure them out. So which you're going to realize is you need to replace PC with PC hat.  Npn with p on hat, which is what I'm doing right here.  We've done this before right you don't have something you can either quit in life and go have a cocktail or you can say why don't I do the best I can here and hopefully that substitution doesn't destroy the universe can get this case. It doesn't so so you got a number like .1 and that's going to play the role of SE.  Okay, so now let's see if you can finish the problem. Give me my confidence interval and then understand what it's saying. That's the hard part of number 6 here.  You're going to push all the formulas through fine. Cuz your college but can you interpret them?  Okay, can you push them bowls with Christian symbols around here is the interval I get know some of you I notice or a little off maybe we rounded differently in the middle.  So you would like to avoid all rounding in the middle of all these steps and carry through as much precision and I don't need you to write 1000 decimal places on the page. You can write three on the page, but on the calculator you keeping track of all the accuracy. That's usually what I do.  Okay, sunny where you get to Centreville now? How do you interpret this? So here's one way we're 95% confident that.  First thing you always put is the parameter. You're trying to study here. It's the true difference in survival rates.  So you need to wear difference now, you can tell me about the populations if you want and then you just need to tell me is in this particular interval. Now again, what that means is we had a procedure. It generates many many intervals infinitely many the procedures designed to have good intervals most of the time. I don't know if our particular intervals are good one or not.  It might be but I'm sure hoping.  The true difference is in the center of all so this is one way of saying that you can cast it as the difference being in there. Okay, there's other ways to cast this also depending on how you want to interpret this and some people will say well if the difference is in some Zone.  If I take the idea that's being subtracted and I added it in to the Zone then. It's telling me the carbolic acid does a 11% to 50% better job at surviving people helping them survive.  Vindy non carbolic acid and if you set up the different so that it's positive. Then you get this interval 11 250. If you use the reverse order, then your interval comes out to be -50 to -11  Cuz that's the only difference that happens. So everything's fine. Now. How do you do this in the computer?  Well, luckily there's just a nice function called prop. Test. So Props for proportions were doing some kind of test here or building some kind of confidence interval in this case. So the first thing you passed it is a vector of all the successes in life. So we had 34 people surviving and 19 people surviving are two populations. Then how many total trials were going on? This is the denominator of all the fractions in the problem.  Okay in the sea just makes a vector here or concatenates with the C stands for these two numbers together into one object.  You can tell what continents over you want. The default is 95 spiritually don't even have to pass that if you don't want and then we're going to do something called correct gets false. This turns off something known as a continuity correction, which one I've been studying this class. Okay, so it'll give you the results you want. So this is how I checked my answer and it was correct.  That is also a bunch of other stuff buried here.  They will be important later. Like if you cared about running a hypothesis test that information's here as well. But right now we just care about the confidence interval. You can see it's also finding the two sample hatted ideas that sound here at the bottom 85% and 54 which we saw throughout the problem showing up.  So, there you go.  We built our first confidence interval. So now I have a sense of how much better sterilization is 11 to 50% more people are likely to survive and we have 95% confidence in that answer.  I'd say we probably want to use sterilization. That's just me though.  You can go Game of Thrones style if you want just cut off limbs with an axe.  Now every time you do any friends, you've got to make sure there's some conditions are met.  These are ensuring that the sampling distribution is what you call it what you think it is a normal distribution. Okay. So the first thing is when you build a sample from one of the populations, it can't be garbage.  So you need to make sure that the two distributions that we subtracted if you go all the way back in the pictures, we got to make sure that these two blue things both are nice normal distributions.  That's the first thing and we already have the conditions from a previous class on how to do this. We need Independence and at least 10 successes and failures and that's in each.  And if you do that, then you have two beautiful normal universes.  Then we need to subtract those in the middle use that variance formula which demanded Independence between the two worlds. So that's the last thing you have to check. So there's really five conditions Independence and simple 110 successes and failures in Sample one independent sample, 210 successes and failures there and finally make sure that the two worlds don't have some hidden connected fabric between them.  And if you can check all these things then you can feel good about running.  hypothesis test or building a confidence interval  Do I need your phone? Will that make you feel better?  They've done studies just touching the phone in your pocket makes people feel better.  So if you could give it to people and you can get the cocaine fix, let's do it will go to Socrative.  the fix  I'm actually sort of the opposite. I hate my cell phone. I don't like touching it or using it ever.  Decrease is my happiness, but I'm not like the world I suppose.  anywho  Let's try this one.  Hello, I talk about two samples.  He'd like to compare them which of the following steps of violate the independence required between the two samples.  Select all that apply.  Haven  That's pretty good. No explanation added.  Whatever we to do. Okay. So once they violate look at you checking all the violators. All you do is just say is there some connection across will it help me predict? So if a random married man has a college degree the chance that the wife does is also very high. If you just look at the statistics on people that marry each other and if they have the same credentialing which is true, okay kids tend to believe what their parents do about religion.  When they're young so you would expect to see matching things are there both checking or both not checking and antidepressants before and after percentage of Happiness. If you're happy without the antidepressant I can pretty much predict. What's going to happen when you take the antidepressant?  I already know you're going to say that you're happy in life. And that's my antidepressant doesn't work. And then we have a problem.  Play X and Y are independent random variables that are normal. What is the distribution of the difference?  Well, how'd you do?  Hopefully, you know that the difference of normal curves is normal.  You got the correct answer?  Normal to square root of 10. So how do you find the word centered? You just subtract means right. So then how do you find the spread out of this? This is where you need the formula relating to variances.  Standard deviations. So basically, I'm just asking you here to do the calculations the wind into US finding the difference of the two sampling distributions for the proportions and repeating that idea. It's a miracle that went well.  Okay, so first find the variance of the difference and then take the square root.  90% CI for difference in proportion of Democrats and Republicans that like Stephen Colbert  You said a few other Democrat - Republican I would you report this.  Okay. So most of you starting to be trained quite well to use this formatting. That's probably why I chose the right question is why or a through C really wrong? They feel so good.  You probably saw these things. They're basically all trying to do the same thing. The trying to claim that the difference is in the interval with high probability. It's not what confidence intervals do they generate intervals that have a good chance of doing it, but that's where the probabilistic language sort of Ends don't make claims about fixed ideas using phrases that feel probabilistic.  Hey, let's try another one. What code would you write?  to run the following confidence interval setup  How do you think this worked?  Now you probably saw.  How quick you are to forget about conditions for inference. Should you actually run a test while you need 10 successes and failures, right?  well, if you go sample a size of  and it's very hard to have both 10 successes and 10 failures that requires 20 at least and a perfect split.  Oh my goodness distraction.  Does sexual orientation affect how much someone prefers a certain color?  Here's a study in 2001 and they found this 95% CI when they asked LGBT males and straight males. How much pink?  how to do o  so first of all, tell u d people 95% confident over the seems good that the difference in the  observed proportions  observed proportions are observed because you collect the data and you look the data. So this is referring to sample statistics. Not true population parameter. That's why D is wrong. So tempting, right?  Be the probability that you perimeter difference lies in this interval Trooper under different fixed idea the universe knows cause of call it up. This interval fixed idea using probability language. Pics ideas. Not good.  Okay, there is not a statistically significant difference. The reason you're saying that is because zero is in the interval which suggests it's a reasonable value. So if the difference equaling zero is very reasonable.  You would want to conclude that. They're the same or that there's not a statistic not a difference.  Okay, those were being just weren't they?  So fun if things are easy in life, right?  I think people love challenge. So I video games are so successful.  Okay. Anyhow, let's talk about hypothesis testing. Now, we've done enough confidence interval. So you're all exhausted with those. I hate confidence intervals. Anyway, I think we should eliminate them from the curriculum, but that's just me and he who normally if you're going to set up a hypothesis test the most boring thing the most status quo. Is that your two populations look identical in relation to whatever it is you're measuring  Why even break it up into church of populations, then they're really the same relative to this. Okay. So you're welcome to use the different equaling zero is your Knoll or if you want you can you see when he goes pee to are interchangeable the value of P. 1 equals P2 is it feels natural? Tell your thinking about it the value of setting it up as the difference. Is it remind you that the way you study this is through the difference. So I'll let you decide which one you want to do. And which things in your brain you want to fire here. Okay. We're still going to have one sided Alternatives and two sides Alternatives. You can stay them with all the parameters on the left side, or you can still stay with P one on the left and Pichu on the right. That's fine also.  Again your choice now, what do we need to do?  We need to always calculate some sort of test statistic that helps us understand what's going on here. What we're going to do is something similar to what we did in the past so back when they're studying one proportion we can use P hat is the test statistic. It drops down onto a normal distribution, right or if you want. If you looked at the rest of the slide, you can convert everything to the standard normal there. You just need to subtract. We think things are centered which is whatever the value is in the null hypothesis and you need to divide how spread out by things are by how spread out things are. So that's the standard error. Okay. So if you want to do that, that's great in the one sample case in the two sample case. You can do the same thing. Okay take what's going on your best guess he won't have - P2 hat.  Subtract where you think the normal distribution is centered. It supposed to be centered at P1 - P2 which if your Knoll is that they're equal you get to Value zero here. It's a lot of people memorize this final form.  And what's cool about this is it takes you from a complicated world the difference in the two distributions and it sort of punches it and crushes it down to something about the standard normal. So move you to the nicest setting you could possibly ever live in to go find P values. That's why a lot of people just do the whole problem straight to the Z distribution.  So if you want to use this issue receipts that you are welcome to do so.  Now there's just one tricky thing in this setting.  And we have to think about and it's called pooling.  So we never done this before because there really wasn't a setting where it made sense. Okay, so when we build confidence intervals, you'll remember that we had to change our P1 and q1 over had abortions cuz we had no choice right and we did that because it was our best guess of what was going on.  The question is what's our best guess here?  What was the different in this setting with hypotheses? Is you believe in the Knoll?  Could you guys at the back close the doors for me, please?  Thank you. When you believe in the Knoll this gives you more information. In fact, it says that the two worlds are studying or the same in relation to the parameter. You care about.  So if you're trying to come up with your best guess for P1 or P2 the right way to do it is through a pooled proportion action. So all you do is you say okay. Yes. I had these two different worlds and I sampled from both.  And there's some successes and failures in both. But if you believe the two worlds are basically identical you could bring it into a big pool a big pot. We're really you just collected a total of N1 + N2 data.  And really the total number of successes going on. It's just the some of those too.  That you do this all the time in life supposed to have two coins. Okay, and we think they're both fair and I give you a coin and I say go flip it a hundred times and then I take the other coin and I flip it a hundred times.  Okay, does it really matter that we spoke this task up between the two of us we could pull all the results back together. Right and it's just one person flipping the coin 200 times instead of splitting it all up. That's if your goal was to figure out what was going on with the two coins.  Okay. So this is what we're going to put in place a P1 had and also P2 hat. It's our best guess for both of those worlds guy. Sophie go back to the Listerine example, and if you're running a hypothesis test  Were you don't really care about the distinction between carbolic and non carbolic patients?  Then you see that 70% of people basically survived.  So if you're going to run a hypothesis test in that setting we would go use this D statistic to help us figure out a single number that could summarize all the results of the study.  And what we would do is calculate do you want it had and did you had us before subtract them?  You're the difference is zero because the note says the carbolic and non carbolic are the same and then for SD pooled. This is our new thing that's going to happen down here.  Can you just replace P1 and P2 hat both with a pooled proportion? Go ahead.  Okay, when you doing the confidence interval?  You have these two worlds and you know, nothing about them. They could be totally different. They could be measuring your measuring survival rate, but they could be totally offset. So there doesn't make it's not fair pull it all together.  Because when you pull you sort of get the overall estimate of what's going on the balance using all the data, but since the worlds are in an alignment, it doesn't make sense to assign the average doubt idea to an unaligned world. But if the worlds are in alignment, then you can average it all together and pool it and then apply that back out so she could you have an hypothesis test to bring the world into alignment that makes pooling reasonable. Go ahead.  Good question. He's wondering why we have to divide by N1 and N2 in the standard error formula when pooling already does some division. You just have to remember there's a lot going on. The first thing is you need to find your best guess of the proportion.  Either Piedmont Hatter Pichu hat you got a fill-in the best thing you can and that will involve a division operation because it's a proportion itself. Right? But then the standard error formula also just happens to involve a division.  Okay, and that's just because of other operations going on. So you during multiple divisions that are in sight, but they come from different places basically is all that's going on.  Okay. So anyhow, the reason you pool is because it's the best guess you can give for P1 and P2 in this setting given everything that's going on.  Anyhow, we have to stop there. I guess we'll end one minute early. You can have a minute or freedom.  Homework 13 do tonight and then have a great weekend. "
