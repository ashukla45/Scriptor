    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  An exciting day, right? You don't have to learn new material, which is good to help work toward better in your skills on the existing material. So we have an exam on Friday again there things aren't right. Now that will help you prepare like old exams.  Perhaps you want to consider studying for the exam differently than you did last time?  So I would recommend completely doing all the review were you think you are now 100% ready? Then take your first practice exam.  They don't use practice exams as the way in which you prepare for things that defeats the whole value that they bring to you. They bring an authentic experience that gives you the opportunity to test yourself on whether you really are ready or not.  So completely study till you're like I'm amazing then take the practice exam under time to conditions with exactly the resources. You're going to have in front of you and see how you really do. Maybe, you know all the material you just can't produce it as fast as you need to  You have to realize there's a huge difference between what it looks like to do homework. Basically infinite time infinite resources infinite people to help you.  Versus an exam incredibly limited resources in all those categories. So give yourself the authentic experience then if there's things you can do go back stud even practice more problems. Then when you feel like you're ready again take a second practice exam for exams.  Okay, so there's lots of opportunities to prove yourself actually grade yourself. You can see the solutions and watch the progress and when it's a number that you're comfortable with then you're ready. So you need to start this much earlier than you might think the slides from today aren't up yet. They will be at the end of class because I wanted you to see what it feels like when you don't have all the answers in front of you and you can't just lock the slide up a little and see what you didn't understand. You need to sit in struggle in those moments.  Okay, the reason I love exam 2 more than any other exam in this class is because it merges probability in statistics statistics together it's at the intersection of those two really okay is not one of the hard things for people is working with the probability models that's half of the skill-set that's going on on this exam the other half is can I build confidence intervals and run they took hypothesis test and you're still getting good at that so you're in foundational stages of that where is probability Theory you're in deeper things so people often have trouble deciding which probability model to use and one of the things that can wheelie help you  The very first question you should ask yourself always is his best thing being measured or discussed in this problem discrete or continuous cuz that immediately throws away half of the models once you've decided that question. So here all the discrete models, you know.  That have memorized facts about and then the continuous models uniform exponential and normal are the big ones right now.  Okay, so we want to work on practicing the choice for these. Okay, but the high level question is about with cold the support the possible values the random variable can take on and whether that is a smooth zone or has little leaps. That is discrete. Okay. So, let's see how you do.  Just got to pick right how hard could it be which model best summarizes the below idea?  the amount of time  before the next volcanic eruption on Earth  Okay.  Look at that.  Someone that got this right, please raise your hand and tell me how you got to the right answer.  What was you thinking?  Amount of time. What about it? That's the numerical idea then what did you do?  How did you get from there to exponential? I'm sorry?  Good. Okay, so you just went straight to the meaning of the exponential it's designed to measure amount of time until something exciting occurs. Because the meaning okay, here's another way to get their first sight of the ideas discrete or continuous amount of time. It could be anything right 7394 years. It doesn't have to be integers. For example, there's no indication of rounding off in the problem. So as soon as I know, it's continuous I threw out a through d  Now if it's uniform then basically any idea should be equally likely and there should be bound on what could happen there have to be a smooth Zone.  But here it could go on for a billion years. I've no idea what the endpoint of the interval is normal distribution. The support of that is negative Infinity to Infinity.  That doesn't really seem like that makes any sense either. So those are all that sort of hinz, but I like the original answer that you gave it just goes straight to what the idea is. So if you know, it's a lot easier another one the number of emails I get today.  Okay, we're getting better notice how few people chose continuous random variables here. I can't get one-and-a-half emails. The number of emails is a discrete idea. Okay. Lots of people are choosing someone who chose the song Tell me how you emotionally got there.  how to emotionally get there  Okay, give me a set number of emails as discreet you throughout a through f e through G Benoit.  Okay, so you noticed that let me rephrase what I think you said negative binomial binomial geometric all have some sort of.  Bernoulli process that goes success failure which has probabilities built into it, but that doesn't seem to be the infrastructure here.  Now I didn't give you an average rate. But if I did it would have cluded in even more if I told you I get 17.5 emails a day.  Then it makes it a lot easier. You can also think about what's possible Okay, negative binomial, you're trying to get K successes. That doesn't seem like it's going on here. But the valley is possible go from K up to Infinity suggesting the 0 1 and 2 which might be less than K aren't even possible. So that doesn't make any sense. Okay binomials are cut off it goes from 0 to n, but here I can get way more than some pics number. So those sorts of ideas help you make this choice, but what you were feeling in your soul with the lack of a Bernoulli trial  And the probabilities associated with it, which I like also. That's very nice.  The number the whole number of days we must wait until the politician next tells a lie.  Okay, people choosing continuous random variable ideas for discreet.  Can someone that got geometric tell me what you're thinking was we're going to make it harder you get one tiny sentence.  One tiny sentence. Good luck.  Just cleaning tickets. I was beautiful. That's exactly what's in my soul whole number means discrete cuz you round off.  And you're waiting until something the first occurrence, which is geometric.  Number of times and Archer hits a Target when shooting a quiver with ten arrows quiver holds all the arrows.  If you're Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games, this is not a random variable.  It always is 10.  K1 sentence how to get to binomial someone that got it  What was in your soul? What did you notice?  Go ahead one sentence.  discreet because number of arrows  Can't be fractional.  and  There's a fixed number of Trials you say these are the Bernoulli things. Did you hit or not? The Target that there's 10 so the only possible values or 0 1 2 and set her up to 10 so that could you to binomial. Okay, let's speed this up the moment during the day that a meteor enters Earth's atmosphere.  You can be the next random meteor or something.  Hey uniform is what I put I'll give you my reasoning.  Moments during the day that measures a Time.  There's not a time that you've been waiting. It's just the time at which something happens should feel like that whistle blowing and hockey problem from the homework somewhere between 0 and 24.  Or if you want 9 a.m. To 9 a.m. The next day or something like that.  And everytime feels equally likely the meteor doesn't respect our day and night it just comes when it wants to come right so it's just as likely to show up at 3 a.m. To 6 p.m. Is anything else?  The number of chocolate you must remove and eat from a huge box if you want for with fruit fillings.  84% negative binomial number of chocolates is a discrete idea. You're trying to get for those with the successes. The length of people's noses.  That's the idea and its totality or you could be thinking the length of a random person's nose.  Will you pick from the earth somehow?  Oh that what kind of fast people are going to do. Well normal now there is one issue with using normal here the possible values out of a normal or negative Infinity to Infinity.  So in some sense, it's not to be ideal measure because it allows for negative nose lengths although I suppose that is possible if you had some sort of accident. But anyway, the normal model will make those values incredibly low probability. So yes, you're mapping into zones that aren't really realistic but it's okay cuz the grass won't be that high.  the number of typos  a student makes on a term paper  Hassan  good feels discreet to me. You can't have one-and-a-half typos.  Would that mean I'm not quite sure so e through G or all wrong.  Okay. I know it's not binomial cuz that suggests there's an upper bound on the number of typos 02 end. I've seen thousands and thousands.  Geometric just doesn't make sense given what's going on? So she has some average weight that students make typos on a given term paper. It wasn't specified, but it's hidden there.  Another thing you can think about your so I know it can't be geometric the possible values for geometric start at 1.  And then go off to Infiniti, but you can make zero errors if you're amazing.  Is that true?  Could you really makes a row? I guess you probably could make zero just have to be ridiculous. So I know it's not you metric.  The one thing they never look at this. I just want to point out something big at a high-level. If you can't even choose the right model to begin the problem. Okay, 60% of the class can beat can continue in 32% of the class gets shut down immediately on this problem. We haven't even asked a question that was trying to identify the model. So you see the central Importance of Being able to choose the right model.  The number of people the TSA my screen before finding someone who forgot to dispose of their water bottle.  those people  foam geometric binomial that suggests there's an upper bound that the TSA agent knows is between 0 and an but it could be a billion people if it's a good day at  I don't know what guardian or something average IQ.  the three contestants  it appear on Jeopardy.  each day  Okay, normal. What is good against normal when you're measuring something biological about human beings in addition since we're averaging.  According to the central limit theorem restart averaging stuff together. It's desperately wants to be normal.  And 3 is not a big number of things to be averaging but it's still pretty good.  Okay.  Maybe we'll I'll look at this we can break so proud of when you zoom in too much the icons don't work anymore.  Oh, there we go. Some loading issue maybe who knows?  Okay, so that's basic skills. You ready for harder things?  How about I just give you some problems? Let's see how you do?  The median of a continuous random variable is a place on the horizontal axis. I'll call it tea.  We're half the areas to the left and 1/2 is to the right.  Find the median of an exponential distribution.  So if you're good, you can do this in two minutes.  That's like top of the class kind of speed. That's what you should be aiming for right now. So I'll let you work for a while.  This is the best. I love teaching this class.  The people in the room were so good. So nice any hoe a picture here. Like where does this number Point? I've actually go is trying to tell you about an area so doesn't go on the horizontal axis. It goes in some shaded thing. So one way to do the problem is set up the integral from 0 to T and try to force it to be point five. You have to remember that this function is not easy to be axe.  It's called the exponential distribution cuz it involves the exponential function, but it's landed x e to the negative Lambda X if the density function of the exponential, okay. So then you going to be to the negative 1/2 x you go plug in the upper and lower bounds.  When you plug in zero you just get the number one and you remember what we're trying to do here or go to solve 40?  Look how many letters you have it so fancy. We have a T and A Lambda a nanny and an ex. You have to four things and this one problem alone. But just remember what everything, you know that he is not really a variable tithing the number 2.7 in k x is really a variable to sweep. It sweeps through all the values between 0 and T2 special kind of variable looks like a variable but it's supposed to be a number. We just trying to figure out what number it is and land is allowed to be whatever it wants. So all these variables sort of different in their behaviors. You never noticed that about variables.  Anyhow eventually get point five equals e to the negative land, but you can take the natural log of both sides and divide by negative Lambda.  And you get dancer that lots of you have on the page?  I wanted to show you that there's other ways to write the answer. I took the reciprocal of both sides cuz it gets rid of negative exponents and turns the 1/2 into the number to which is nice and then I get tea for the lawn to Natural I go to over Lambda if you have a negative sign on your answer, that's fine cuz you probably have a natural log of 1/2 and that negative sign can go into the natural log and slip on half to the number two.  So the answer should depend on Landa and Landa berries the shape of this thing berries and hence the place below which half the area lies will move accordingly.  Okay, so there was your first real test of how you're doing.  Yes.  in Seguin face  if you integrate from T to Infinity.  You will get an area .5 so you could have set up the problem two ways go from 0 to T and get 1/2 or go from tee to infinity and get one half the both give the same answer. I just chose the way that avoided having Infinities cuz I could do it.  Who wants to go that limit garbages and goes to Infinity by variables? You need a variable for the limit going to Infinity?  I guess you lose the tea or no, you don't and you have five variables. I don't have five variables. Okay?  68% of a normal distribution is within one standard deviation of its mean.  roughly that was a little rule what percentage of a uniform distribution  is within one standard deviation of its mean  so I'll give you two minutes if you're super good 5 minutes if you're still working and growing.  That's what five five minutes feels like goes fast. Doesn't it? Here's a picture of the uniform distribution. You'll call the height of this line segment right here is 1 / B - A.  It's that high so that the area of this whole picture can come out to be one underneath it. Okay. So what you need to do is find the middle of this place, which is Mew a 50 / 2.  And then you need to go one standard deviation each Direction.  And then that's the area you want to find.  So in this case, the standard deviation is B minus a over Route 12.  So I need to do is find the area of this rectangle.  So now you have to know what how wide is it and how tall is it? And that will instantly find the area of the rectangle. So the width of it is just two standard deviations cuz you went one each way from the meeting so it's to time to standard deviation formula.  And the height of it you can see is one of her B- a cuz I did that earlier.  So when you multiply those two things together.  You just get to over the square root of 12.  Which is about 57.7% So the 68 95 99.7 rule is only true for normal distributions for other kinds of distributions. They would have their own sets of numbers, but no one memorizes those.  Oh my goodness. It's also cool is it doesn't matter what uniform you're on notice how all the A's and B's just banter somehow.  Well the same thing sort of happened with the normal. It's always 68 regardless of whatever the center is in the standard deviation is  So this is a common phenomenon, you're kind of measuring the thing against itself like okay. I don't know what A and B are but that will influence every feature about what One Nevada calculate from where it centered how spread out it is and somehow that all gets wiped away in the calculations, which is pretty stunning so that you could actually do something like this.  Okay.  I love problems like this.  They don't look like any cookie cutter here, right? There's no template. You never done something like this.  You just have to think and understand the ideas that are going on and bring those to the battle as it were.  There's another one egg weights to go measure how much an egg weighs.  You get a mean of 2 ounces with a standard deviation. You probably noticed this not all eggs with the same when you open the carton there slight variations.  When you buy a carton of the of eggs, that will have 12.  And your goal is to find a cartoon where the total weight when you add up all the eggs. Imagine that the curtain has no weight itself it weightless.  Curtain you want to find one with a total weight above 25 oz?  How many cartons do you expect you're going to have to look through?  Before you finally get one that meets your happiness requirement. Is it like going to the store taking the first carton of eggs putting it on your scale ending like  I have enough in the next 100 price the same as much as you can as much as egg as you can out of things.  So how many cards do you expect to go through before finding one that is heavy enough and what assumptions?  What part of all of your calculations so there's a problem. It takes 5 minutes if you really know what's going on. So we'll stretch it out to eight or nine.  Good luck.  In case you're worried all these slides we posted once class is complete and there's some additional problems we will get to so you could practice even more.  Can I supposed to receive the first is I see some people in the room focusing on the average egg weight that needs to be in this carton.  So you're saying got to be 25 or more and there's 12 eggs. So they divided 25 by 12. That's fine. So those people are going to be working on a distribution that studies average equates, which is with C / 12 is so all you people are on this normal distribution center to a point to over Route 12 is your spread.  Okay. I wanted to show you that you could do this problem. Also just on the distribution called see which is the sum of all the weights.  Okay, so if you know what's going on with the average silver 12, you can figure out what's going on with see if you would just want to multiply both sides by 12 and we know what happens when you multiply random variables.  Buy a number in the expectation. You just move it out in the standard deviation. Just move it out, or you can just move it in. Okay, so if you think about taking the center line and Bobby Slayton on the right these formulas down here just say multiply each component by 12.  Okay, some people just said I don't want to there's no point in going through all the average stuff. You don't in fact need to go through there. If you have an idea that's normally distributed and you add it to itself a bunch of times, you know that you can find the sum by just adding up the expectations and you can find the standard deviation by thinking about variances first. So all you do is just a bunch of variances and then take the square root. So anyhow half the room probably wants to be on distribution distribution and 1/2 ones to be on this distribution. It doesn't matter though give you the same answer.  Okay. So now what we care about?  Is exploring what's going on with the carton weight?  Okay. So here's the weight of a carton pictured it wants to be 24 on average and we want to get bigger than 25.  So now you just need to find this area. So one option is to go get yourself the answer via a z table.  So then you have to convert this. So that's why we needed the standard deviation in the center so we could subtract them in / them.  Okay, all the people fancy calculators can just tell me what you're typing into your calculator. So if you're going to use your calculator on the exam is fine. Lots of calculators have that functionality just say here's what I'm typing in. Okay Pino on blah blah blah or whatever. It is on your calculator and all the table people will just show going to a table. Like I'll see you calculating the z-score here, and I know you're going to go to a table and then I'll see you getting the number .07 for 9. So there's only a seven and a half percent chance that you can get heavy enough curtain.  And now it's going on. We don't just want to get a carton to figure out if probability now. We want to have a random variable for how many cartons are going on in order to get one that's heavy enough. So that turns out to be a geometric random variable. And what we're looking for is a heavy enough Carton and a probability P. We just found so you should get the answer 13.35.  Set exam will definitely combine multiple distributions into the same problem. So first get yourself where you feel like I'm good enough to do any problem that has one distribution going on and then be ready for two things in the same problem and plenty of homework problems had that and other things on the slides. So there's other places to practice, but I'll see you on Friday.  Good luck study hard, I believe in you.  Probably about you.  chapter "
