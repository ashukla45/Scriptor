    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back this weekend.  It's time to begin chapter 3 momentous Turn the page on the old.  We left off of probability models. They had expected values and standard deviations, but there is no use if they don't actually model the real world.  Perhaps there's some out there that come up all the time.  And perhaps we could study those and with a small list of tools.  Attack 90% of the things in the universe. That's what a tool box really is those tools that have survived and have broad applicability. So I'd like to move Beyond these situations that had beautiful little probability tables.  And move over instead to the common questions of The Human Experience.  If we can come up with a probability model, then we can do all sorts of things with it. I want you to realize that at the outset you can find the probability of some event you care about you can see what's going to happen on average. You can see how spread out your experience will be as you experience the average thing.  So the question now is what does life actually look like. This is an epistemological question the nature of knowledge. How is it structured? If you could see you seen The Matrix right? Like the code is Flowing Down the Walls. If you could see it, what would it look like? That's what we want to do here and we'll come up with a set of models that solve this issue and will do the same things you've been doing with them that is fine probabilities expected values and some measure of spread.  So we got to start with the basic the easiest thing you could ever dream up will be our starting point. And that's the following what if you have a random process that can only have one of two outcomes.  Okay, if only one outcome there's no point in studying. It is not random that always gives you the same thing. So we'll start with two now. It's important that as you repeat this independent. Sorry this random process state of beavers called Independence. So whatever happened on the first time.  Whatever is all you got should not impact what you get on the second time.  Guys, like think about flipping a coin the two outcomes are heads and tails.  And when you flip the coin the second time you don't think I owe it remembers what just happened and we'll make a decision based on that. So how coin works?  Where is it?  I don't know any how besides coins you can roll a die.  But the problem is it a six sides. So you have to dichotomize it give it two options. I would even or odd gene mutations are nice example soccer game results win or not. We so there you can see I put pie into Los you're not the winner if you tie and some sense so you can take out of my eyes just about anything whether it's a good idea or not is another question. So whenever you have this kind of setup is known as a Bernoulli trial named after one of the famous Bernoulli brothers and cousins random variable is one way to think about this.  So it's a big capital letter X if you want.  And it only has two possible values.  Now you can call them one and zero you can put words on them like success and failure.  It doesn't really matter if you're thinking about is a random variable. It really needs to spit out a number. So people tend to put the number one on the success, but if you're not worked up over at random variable Miss right now, you can just put words. He also needs Best Buy How likely they are. Well since it's only two outcomes, it's actually quite easy. You can choose the letter P for the probability of success to remind you of the damn problem with the water in San Diego each damn had a probability of success P. So that was really a Bernoulli trial. I just wasn't telling you that.  And the failure has to be the remaining amount of stuff 1 - P 9 people often use the letter q for that. Sometimes it's valuable to have two variables both which are clean and pretty and short. Sometimes. It's nice to have one variable called pee but then unfortunately the other thing is 1 - P which is a little Messier. We will use both depending on what we need in life. So this is the basis the Bernoulli trial.  and everything we do is going to be based on this so hopefully  You're already good to go on this idea. Let's find out.  Socrative  so my best friend is obsessed with the Portland Timbers.  That's soccer for you people that don't follow MLS.  Why can't they make technology work? Why do I have to fix the inadequacy?  So let's suppose the chance. They win a soccer game is 40% That's not good if your team.  It never going to make the playoffs.  What is the probability they lose the ninth game of the season?  Okay, look at all these fun answers.  People that choose a I give you the success probability and asked you about the failure idea.  Have people messing that up a people doing C or either choosing it because it looks complicated.  Or they're not observing that the question has nothing to do with the first eight games of the season. It's just about the 9th and the 9th game is like the first game and the first game has a 60% chance of loss.  Lose their first two games and win their third.  There's two thirds of the room.  Good, the people that shows they are just confusing winning and losing and flipping those around everything else is negligible. We shouldn't talk about probability. They lose every game in the 16-game season.  No way Jose.  That's a philosophical answer rather than a mathematical answer.  Okay, B is the most tempting wrong thing, but it doesn't get it how probabilities actually work. If you want to make Anne's happen, they turn into products and product turn into exponents when repeated. Hey Edition turns into multiplication when repeated.  Which of these are Bernoulli trials?  Mark all that are correct.  Be careful.  Oh my goodness.  Okay. Remember, there's two conditions one is a dichotomous. Are there only two options. That's why a bails.  in addition to dichotomous  is every time you do it independent of the others whether each bite of pizza taste good or not that feels dichotomous, but I'm guessing I can predict the second bites goodness for you based on your response to the first bite.  Whatever you say the answer is probably the same which is why food it exists because it has a consistent experience on every bite if it buried on every bite, you probably wouldn't eat it cuz you could have a bad time in life whether it rains or not each day this week while they're weather patterns.  So if it rains today, there's a good chance of rain tomorrow.  And the others are independent things you'll notice when you put balls back before drawing them again, it creates an independent situation cuz it Returns the bag of balls to its original state. So the bag has no memory anymore.  Okay.  Have you figured out how to game the system yet on these?  First thing you do is you try to select all 5 at some point. It won't let you select anymore because it knows how many correct answers there are so this way you can at least determine how many correct answers there are.  Her dangerous to use things like that to help you decide on it what to do in life though. So I give you that knowledge. It's dangerous knowledge for you. Okay. Now the Bernoulli trial is so basic that it models very few things Queens. For example, the life is a lot more complicated, right? So let's think what are the common questions now, they're going to use the Bernoulli as an input basically. So first time what is the probability it takes exactly K Bernoulli trials, you can think coin flips if you want before goes to get the first and that's the important word in the first success. So often in like you're doing something over and over and over and you're waiting until you finally get a success.  This is what dating is.  You go on dates, right? They fail they fail they fail than a success and that's what you're waiting for. So America loves the idea first.  You want something to show up? Okay, you can fill it with all sorts of ideas here play games until you win go through emails until you get a real message. This is what in box filtration is now right? Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete something good.  Okay. So this is a question about doing it until you get the first success and you might just want to know the probability. It will take a certain number of times. So it's your measuring here is how many things you have to filter through to get your success and the success is included there you might also ask what on average is going to happen here.  How many emails do I have to read each day before? I get one from my student or get one that is spam in the Box categorized it incorrectly. Yeah.  The first success has a probability of occurring. Yeah.  But the problem is you have to make all the failures before it. If you're going to try to have it be a certain number of time. She'll see you in a sec will get to this the same ideas and no just asking on average how many times have to do it? So the important thing about this you're counting how many Bernoulli trials it took?  In order to get the success that the random variable that underpinning this the number of Bernoulli trials. So anytime you do something like this about the first of the geometric model.  And you'll see why in a moment that it has this name. And this is one of the four most common probability models. It's discreet because it's measuring how many Bernoulli trials you have to do.  The possible things are one you immediately got a success to you got a failure than success 3 failure failure success. So it's what's going on here. So it's easier if we sort of puts a notation to this and see some examples, but you're going to notice that anytime I ask these questions to always be said of questions that are probabilistic and then questions that are about parameters like what's true on average or how spread out is our experiences. We're going through this.  Okay. Now this one you can actually easily figure out the probabilities you care about.  Because the situation has not gotten that complicated so far. So we're going to make a little table here. So we'll start by putting what possible if you're measuring the number of Trials needed.  Then the only possible values r123 etcetera it goes on forever. So this is our first example of a probability table with infinitely many rows.  Okay. So bad all way if it really do is describe the general one if it took extra miles and we'll do that based on these patterns here. So hopefully believe that if you're going to immediately have success in life. It's because the probability P has enacted that has occurred basically.  Now if you want there to be two trials exactly then you have to fail at first which is a Q and then you have to do a pee and that those questions about the Portland Timbers preview this idea. I made you fail and game one failing game two and then succeed in game 3 you were doing the geometric model even though you didn't realize it and you didn't really care about how many it took to get that first success, which was the number three in that problem. You were more focused on the probability. So sometimes you focus on the left column and sometimes it's the right. So here are two failures and then it success yours multiplying to get a bunch of and events in the cool thing is their independence. So the an breaks up into lots of little probabilities. So hopefully you can fill in this spot right here.  Your ex is an integer.  Your goal is to take exactly X trials to finally get your success. So the success is included in the X It's the final one. So you failed x -1 x in order to finally get your success. Lots of bad dates kissing frogs is the American metaphor. Do they have it in other countries? You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you get your prince or princess.  Any great metaphors from other countries?  I don't know anything about dating everyone just swiped left and right you got to swipe a lot left before you swipe, right?  The Tinder swipe right the good one.  Does anyone know about Tinder?  Okay, no one knows about Tinder. Certainly, not me.  I don't have a Facebook account. So there goes that Betty Who?  If you have this beautiful table here, you'll notice that each row is basically measuring a probability. It's a probability that it takes exactly a certain number of times to get that for success.  And the expected value you should think about is a fact about the entire table here. It's saying these are the different things that could happen in the left column and they are so if one did an average  Of these ideas with these weightings. You can get the expected number of Trials. How many times do you have to swipe left before you finally swipe right on average? How many dates you have to go on?  Okay, so what we've done so far as we've established the probability table, that's the key to starting all of this here and one thing you'll notice about this probability table. If you just look at the probabilities, these numbers are a geometric sequence.  Where the common ratio getting X is Q hence the geometric model.  It's so nice when life makes sense right now, if you want to set up one of these entities the way you do this as you say let x equal a geometric model with a perimeter P. So sometimes you will know the perimeter P if it's a coin you might put .5 in there.  But what you're setting up when you put X here x is spitting out how many trials so it is this box and you hit a button on it and I'll spit out 13 which means you failed 12 times and then finally succeeded on the 13th. Okay, the probabilities are hidden inside the box and embedded in that probability table. If you want to use this little symbol right here this till this is red is distributed as so there's this new box called X. It's distributed as or has the inner workings of a geometric model that geometric model only needs one fact, how heavy is the coin. How even is the dice how winning is the team that's called p  Okay, the other two facts you have to know about this which one are going to prove in. This class are the expected value and some measure of the spread that you can either use the variance of the standard deviation when you reporting this cuz you can move between them fluently. So here they expected value is 1 / p  and the standard deviation unfortunately doesn't have a clean formula. Oh my goodness route Q.  What cave is 1 - B?  Over p Yelp reviews in 180a if you take that you actually have the ability to prove them now because you know how to find the expected value in the variance of something. They're just hard calculations.  They involve lots of infinite geometric series.  Because it's a geometric distribution. Okay, so if you get excited about proving things now, you have an opportunity a challenge has been thrown down and at the end of the slide you can see how to find the expectation if you need help.  Okay, so we'll see how you do flip a coin until you get Tails. That's the success event. I've defined on average. How many times do you expect it will take someone help us?  You don't get the answer easy questions anymore. You must always determine the difficulty of every question set a threshold in your above it go ahead.  1 / 1/2  I love that you answered in a way that actually makes sense.  They could help people. That's the beauty of that answer. Okay. So in your head did you first set up a geometric random variable? That's the question. I want to know about your head.  So if you want to get good at all this stuff, make sure you're setting up your random variables. This is the single most important thing you can do to be good at these kinds of problems also decide if you can use an equal sign or a is distributed as sign when you get to high level classes. Everyone uses the is distributed as the equal to sort of a dental thing for people who haven't done much stuff yet. Anyhow a coin with 50% tail.  Which is our success event. So 1 / 0.5 or two.  You can also see the standard deviation here is \u221a 2 by just plugging stuff into the formula.  Okay. So what does that mean? It means if I give everyone in the room a coin and I say Flip Flip Flip till you get tails and then I have you all scream at me how many flips it took you might say three might say 14. You might say one on average the number I will hear coming out.  is 2  And since the \u221a 2 is about 1.4, I would expect to see things a little higher than 2 in a little lower by standard deviation or maybe a couple so let's try just flip a coin. Com.  The name basically says your goal is to get Tails. So I want you to flip until you get tails and count how many flips.  including the tails  then send me that number and Socrative.  I wonder if you're flipping the default coin right now if you switch to some currency that you like.  Are you one of those people that immediately Tunes the parameters of the object you have before you start using it, or do you not care about all that stuff?  Okay, time to fix all the garbage.  Welcome to data science.  Oh my goodness.  Okay, I need a decider.  Who wants to be the decider?  You're the decider.  Here we go five.  fine 6  Uno  You want to cut it or you want to change it to 1?  tails  you want to change it to 100K a decision has been made and finally at the bottom here. We have 10. How do you feel about that?  I think it's fine. Okay, it's later in the dataset.  Which means they're probably person sat there for a while if it were first in the dataset, maybe you throw it out, right?  If it's later in the day to said you could believe the time.  Okay, so let's go put that somewhere. How about the desktop?  CSV sounds good to me.  And I can't turn that off.  I can't mute the computers input even though the system says I should be able to.  Okay, so you just screamed at me?  Do you think the average of all your noise was to let's go find out.  Okay. So how do I figure out the expected value?  Do you want me to take the means to me and is not a weighted-average? Why do I not need to take a weighted average?  Very equal, what's today?  The probabilities are not equal the probabilities are dictated by this complex model here.  Why is this answer me incorrect even if he doesn't know why it's correct.  Doesn't matter if it's large or small.  That's not the answer.  Someone support the supporter you don't get to resupport yourself.  I know you've already figured it out.  Go ahead.  It's not because q and P of the same value so you noticed the same value than their 1/2, right? So it says that one shows up half the time it shows the two shows up 1/4 of the time.  Three shows up in eight of the time. I have tons of 1/2 x 1/2. I'm wondering why a simple meme is good enough.  I value everyone's flips equally social justice argument.  Very nice idea also wrong. Go ahead.  Very good. If you go ask a lot of people to do something if an event is likely it shows up a lot in the data set.  That is why it's simple mean is okay here because the representational waiting has already been taken into account.  And you're going to see it if I draw a histogram of the data.  Okay, so let's take the meaning of trash.  when we get to  Uh, oh.  What do you think happened?  No one's done any data science in the room.  Remember how this all started we did a cleanup process part of the cleanup process with your troll oenis, including the word Uno and Tails. How did Excel interpret my data?  Go ahead.  Did it convert it all to characters because there were some characters you bet.  So why don't we convert it all to numbers? How do we do that format cells number you can see it had it is generally first or something like that. Okay, how do you know in Excel if it's numbers versus text?  Go ahead.  If it's right align vs. Left align, so what do you think about this? Is it ready?  Which one's the number idea?  You think numbers are right.  Okay, let's see if we can get this for Madame turn them into numbers.  Will it work?  It's not aligned. You want me to delete this?  Come on, seriously converted to numbers.  It looks like the line to me.  Do you think left a line is the numbers?  It's been awhile who really knows Excel anyway, right?  I mean it's garbage so.  Why learn the garbage tool?  Yeah, you guys probably know Excel better than I do.  Let's see if we've done it.  Sign that your garbage tool you have to convince people to move things to your format.  Do you want to keep using this weird CSV thing or do you want to go back to the Excel format that I desperately want you to go to?  Oh my goodness. Let's try again.  Now what's it going to do here? Do we have a choice anywhere on how to encode it?  Just change it to numbers or something like that. This is also an option sometimes now you can forcibly  Change things to numbers now. You want to know what's really going on?  Does anyone know what really just happened?  You do what?  What's your theory?  That's very nice. There we go.  It helps if you actually take out the column you want doesn't it?  So two problems that can arise you'll see all the time.  Kohl's turn your data types into what you don't want and you treat the dataframe like a dataframe instead of pulling up a column you care about it gets really frustrating when you have a dataframe with one column. It's so easy to make that mistake. We got to  Really? You think it's exactly two?  Or do you think I'm just currently operating without enough decimal places in our because I was doing other things yesterday.  I'll leave it for you to think about. Anyhow, we can also find the standard deviation of this trash.  Okay. Now it's giving us decimal points. That's a good sign. So maybe it really does happen to come out to be to that was a miracle if it did. Okay, you can go take the \u221a 2 and see how far is the standard deviation is from what it supposed to be.  Okay good. So you were one example of a geometric random variable just now.  Now that is just the gentle one.  That's the easier thing to think about.  Now I want to show you the picture of this because it will help you realize some of the wrong answers that were happening earlier in case I hear all the probabilities. So one thing you'll notice about this is the most likely thing ever.  In a geometric model, is it a takes exactly one?  time to do something  because pee is actually bigger than all of these numbers and you know that because Q is less than 1 and when you multiply by something less than 1  Make it smaller.  Until you keep making it smaller and smaller. Okay. So here's a picture of all those different possible values. Okay. So if he happened to be point to that's the height of the first bar. It makes Q .8 so the next part is only 80% tall was the first bar and it just keeps getting lower and lower.  Now the expected value is the balancing point of any histogram or any probability model, which also looks like a histogram with infinitely many data points in it. Okay. So here it is the balancing point at 5 on average. That's what you're going to get.  Now what's interesting is the most common thing you will get is the mode. That's the number one.  But on average you going to get five to all these crazy things out here with huge numbers. They're very unlikely, but when they show up they contribute a huge value to the average.  So there's that picture and the heights of These Bars form a geometric sequence.  Okay, I'm going to give you two minutes to do this spam problem as long as we're talking about garbage.  trash  91% of all emails in the world is found. That is a true statistic.  You just don't see that because Google helps you write.  Filters out all that nonsense you decide to turn off your spam filter each day. You're going to count how many emails you have to read before you get to an actual message. Now that your inbox is all requests for money and all sorts of other sort of nonsense. It comes in Span.  Okay, after you read your actual messenger going to go to the beach. How many do you expect to read on a given day?  What are the mean and standard deviation and would it be strange to have to read 20?  First thing you should do on this problem is set up a random variable.  Good luck.  Okay, we need a random variable. It should have a capital letter. You should Define it in words first. It should be measuring the number of Trials.  In order to get that first success.  Once you have it in words, then you can go Define it just through simple notation if you want like a geometric model, or you can just start using it. So hear the success event is getting a real message.  That's a .09 don't just take the numbers in the problem and use them as P. Okay, so here it  You need to take one- this in order to get what we care about. So 11 messages roughly on average is what's going to happen. Now the standard deviation formula you get 10 points.  Now you have to decide what it means for something to be strange. Obviously. I just chose some weird word here to make you feel uneasy. We're all going to disagree on Stranger Things.  So often what people will say is anything within one standard deviation of the mean is a pretty common or unstrange experience. Sometimes people to find things within two standard deviations to be on strange or common  So here we are within one standard deviation that's pretty normal in life. So reading 20 messages is a very common thing.  Hey, I'm not going to ask you problems were I'm going to have you guess what my definition of strange was. So don't worry about that. Not one of those teachers.  Okay, so that was the easy one now. It's time for the harder model.  In the first model, you just did something over and over and I could go on for Infinity.  In this model, what we're going to do is choose a certain number of times. We're going to do it at the beginning. Okay, and we're going to let that BN we're going to do Bernoulli thing and times and you might wonder how many of those end times will come out to be successes. So here K you'd be excited about so if you're going to put the coin 5 times may be excited about getting two heads.  So this is the main difference now, there's this extra parameter here that dictates how many times you're going to do something? Okay. You could Wonder on average. How many times are you going to succeed when you do something and times?  What is it when there's a bound on what can happen it's going to totally change. The probability model. Here is the binomial model because it uses something called the binomial coefficient.  Oh, my goodness will see a good previous math classes are if this is a tool that you're used to or not, but it answers how many successes you'll get.  If you do something to fix number of times to see the numerical nest of it how many successes?  in a fixed number of Trials  Okay, and you should imagine in is a number that sort of known.  Even though right now I'm hiding its value from you so we can consider in generality what could occur?  Okay. Now we're going to skip some of these warm up questions because I've now filtered them into what we do and we're just going to try to jump straight to this model and see if we can make sense of things. So first thing when you draw the probability table, you'll know that has a finite number of rows because you're doing the thing of finite number of times and if you ask how many successes you're going to get the only possibilities are your complete failure. You got zero, you're the best thing ever. They all succeeded or something in-between.  Now some of these cases are quite easy to think about you don't need any fancy tools. For example, if you're going to 1602 * you need to fail every single time.  Do you need to string together in total failures fail and fail and fail all the ants become multiplications all the fails become Q's, you multiply other cues, since there's any of them you could cute to say so that's a pretty easy case another easy cases here on the bottom. You want to succeed in life every single time.  Well, every attempt needs to result in success. Those are all peas super stringing together total Zen successes.  the wave Pizza van  where this tricky is here in the middle.  And the reason is why you know how many successes you want in this big long list of trials. They could have her and so many different spots.  And this is the tricky thing so you can see right here if we're going to have one success. Well, maybe it's in the first slot and all the others are failures, or maybe it's in the second slot and all the others are failures.  Now what's neat about these different cases if they all have the same probability of occurring because they all have a total of n -1 failures. So that's cute in the end minus one.  And you'll have one success. Okay. So when you're doing is it doesn't matter where the S is in the list.  So if the event you care about is one success.  Then it breaks out into all of these cases.  And it's easy to find the probability of each of these cases. All you need to do now is add them all together and to add together a bunch of things that are all the same number.  The only thing you're missing is how many of them there are and that becomes a multiplication idea.  So how many ways are there to list one letter s?  In a list that has n spots in it.  Whoeasy doesn't meet your threshold. Go ahead.  N choose one. What can you do without the shoe symbol for me?  I'm sorry.  10 equals n  Oh Daddy goes on very nice. Okay, if you're going to put a nest in a list of in spots  Put it somewhere know if there's any spots, right? And as soon as you put it in all the rest or failures so we can go in the first Potter the second spot and so on. Okay, so that one's not too bad.  And you're right the best way to think about this is the chews symbol. So what we need is a tool that helps us count the number of ways to drop some letter s is and will choose how many we want to drop in to list events parts and all the others will be failures and the two symbols the way you do this. Okay, so you can do with one s among the apps or you could do lots of s's depending on what's going on. So here's our new symbol. It's a set of parentheses with an n and a k there's no division bar. Okay.  Pinterest a new mathematical symbol. So what is returning to you is a number that's the first thing to realize.  And the number of returns is a count of something and what is trying to do is saying, okay, let's endure end slots.  And you wanted Kay of them to have successes in them.  I will tell you how many ways there are to drop in your pretty asses into the list.  No, just because I put a fancy symbol on it doesn't mean it's any easier to calculate. All I did was suppress a complicated question down to a notational nicety. So it turns out you can show that the way you calculate this object is finding n factorial.  Which is the product of all the integers from 1 up to end.  dividing it by K factorial times and minus K factorial  If you take a common a Taurus class that is a accounting class on how to count stuff in life. This will be one of your primary tools that you will use.  Okay, so if you want to do this on your calculator, maybe or something like a TI-83 or some variant. This is usually found under some sort of probability menu under some math menu. So you want to go figure out where are on yours. You can go do this. Another notation is NCR on some calculators. That is a choosing or and is the ID in the top and ours when I'm calling k  Okay. So if your goal in life saver to drop two successes into five spots, it says there are 10 ways to do this. Apparently, maybe you don't believe that I'll show you in a minute in arteries. Eu's the choose notation here.  Okay, so what this does now, it less allows us to fill in the remaining spots. So thank you for saying n choose one earlier. You nicely previewed. What's about to happen?  So if we go back and rethink our goals have one success in life.  So the first thing you say is well, let's let's figure out how to make that probabilistically happen. The p is R16s hears us feeling the rest of the spots with failures and this n choose one is recognizing that there's lots of ways in which one success could happen. It could happen in the first spot.  Or maybe erase your mind. It happens in the second spot or someone. It could happen in different ways. And this n choose to is counting the number of ways. Okay. So let's let's say he was 5 maybe going to flip a coin five times and you goes to get heads and you'd like to know how likely it is that you'll get to  Okay, so here is a list of all the different ways to get to heads. They'll have two s's in them. Right and I just systematically redistributed the s's throughout.  Okay, so that's what the end choose to is counting the number of things in this list here. And then the probability is measuring How likely any one of them is and since they're all the same.  When you add them all together that effectively creates a multiplication idea and the number you should multiply by how many things are in this list, which is 5 choose 2 or n choose to in general.  And if you don't believe if I choose to is 10, you can see me doing the calculation here. No one reason. I showed you this is because sometimes you don't have your calculator and you need to evaluate these you notice a lot of cancellation that happens right write everything out the big long way.  And then just cancel all the repeated things and you'll get down to a simpler cookie.  Another thing you should know about these two symbols is N20 and inches and her both one and so back up here. I didn't originally have a N20 written. We just a cute idiot, right but you can put the entrance zero there cuz it's one and it doesn't change the problem and it creates a symmetry to what's going on in this picture right here.  Gossiping about this way if your goal is to have zero success in life. There's only one way to do that fail.  Abysmally everywhere there. That's the one way to make that happen. Now put all the failures in.  Okay, so if you want to wait, this is a random variable when you're setting this up. I still have two minutes. You don't get them.  I do we do.  Oh, I love doing that. Okay, so you just need two parameters tell me how many times you're going to flip the coin or roll the die that's in tell me how likely it is to succeed on any one of those flips her rolls at p x is measuring it's a numerical idea here is measuring how many successes you got and it's random because you can get lots of very few.  Now How likely you are to get a certain number of successes? Let's take a is dictated by the model. We just arrived.  That you need to succeed K times at speed UK. You need to fail all the other times 2 to the N minus K and you need to recognize that there are lots of ways in which the successes and failures could be moved around once you decided how many there will be that's what the N choose K does.  So there's the probability thing. The only other thing you need to know is on average how many successes should you expect?  So the formula here is the expected value is just an x p how many times you doing it How likely is it to succeed on any one of those if I told you we're going to flip a coin 100 times and I say how many heads do think you probably say 50, right and you're just doing an x p so it's in your soul already. What's \u221a npq? So you will need that for the homework. There are a ton more problems on here that I suggest you try working before you dig into the homework and have a good day. I'll see you later. "
