    "Full Transcript": "Morning, welcome back.  You may have noticed that the exams have been graded.  So great. So probably sent you an email said hey look at me.  So you have till Thursday at 8 a.m. To get those free greater question.  The median was about a 73% I would have loved to see that being 83% but I think some people.  for me to look at what they've been doing and figure out ways to  improve things  there's some tough problems, right?  I want people's ability levels to raise. I want people to challenge themselves.  You're almost ready for the real world. It's going to be a lot of hard problems out there.  I told my parents the other day. I said the hard thing about my life cuz I never get to work on a problem that anyone else really knows how to solve.  And it's incredibly frustrating but that's for that be your life. But if you want to think about really interesting things you have to get used to the most difficult problems that are out there and I'm going to keep pushing you and raise that level.  So today is a beautiful topic. I love this. I feel like you really become something. Once you've done this lecture. They're going to talk about continuous random variables.  So the book is not great on this most books are not great on this. So there's a little supplement online. If you'd like to read some Triton Ed of continuous random variables of a help you so here's our world so far. It's very contrived and it's very discreet. That's how you know, you're not doing things right in life when you have that feeling so we'd like these weird games, right? And then we had these models say geometric, but they can only take on  Say integer values are non-negative integer values or some finite list of values and that's not really how life works. Okay, discrete random variables find out if anything's or spaces in between your infinitely many times one space to Space 3 Etc. So today we're going to do continuous random variables. And this is a tool that helps you measure any idea that can spit out of value smooth zone of possibilities. You should make an interval from math class like the smooth interval from 3 to 17.  Where you could at 3.9 if you wanted okay. Now there's a lot of things in life to feel this way the amount of water you drink in a day. It's not the number one cell phone number to it could be 1.7. It could be halfway between 1.7 and 2 it could be pie.  Whatever gallons of water could be anything.  How long you wait for a bus? So most people would agree that time is continuous.  Although that's a complicated question. If there's some like smallest amount of time that the Universe allows but will soon time is continuous and how far you live from the nearest grocery store. Also continuous doesn't have to be some integer value. It's really you could imagine someone spitting out any kind of value now that you're the reason we haven't done this yet everything in life becomes incredibly more complicated when Infinity comes into the picture when you allow them to values and their own a smooth range. How do I make a probability table?  If the possible rows are any number between say 0 and 100.  What are you going to put after the number 3?  3.1. Whoops. What about 3.05? What about three point zero zero zero zero one. So there's a problem right there somewhere to find probability for these weird situations back in the old days probabilities was defined so that we had this ratio, right? Unfortunately when the universe is suddenly allowed to be infinite the denominator that ratio becomes Infinity.  And what happens when you divide by Infinity?  Some people say zero some people like doesn't taste good. Both of those are great responses. Okay, so we're going to need a new infrastructure basically to handle continuous random variables because the question the answer to these questions are very counterintuitive.  Along the way we're going to Steven resync with a probability of 0 means switch to wipe your drain and refill it with something better and more sophisticated. Okay. So let's go back to the world. This will help you realize what we should do. So here's a picture of the binomial model. You're flipping 16 coins. They're all fair. And what you're asking is how many heads come out dad is the random variable. It's a long horizontal axis. The only possible values are between 0 and 16 and integers in case you can see the possible values along the horizontal axis.  Guess what is one way to visualize it? And what we're going to do is steal all the great ideas from the visualization the things we desperately want to happen as we move over to continuous random variables and will maintain those ideas and just figure out what do we have to do along the way so here's the list of three things that you really want to maintain.  Okay one.  Some kind of outcome, which is on the horizontal axis is more likely if there's more area above it or in the rectangle that appears above it in blue.  Guess that's one thing. That's true. That's how you decide what things are more likely in the picture you look for the taller bars or equivalently the bars with more area cuz they all have a base of one so they are hyped becomes an area idea.  the other thing  all these areas better out of two one. If you flip 16 coins and count the number of heads something will happen and the possibilities are listed along the axis. So this encapsulate everything is possible.  Maybe never thought about that before with the picture. That's really critical.  And then the last thing is when I draw a bar here the heights needs to be at least a zero, okay, or they can be positive and negative height cuz that would mean you have a negative probability. And what would that mean?  Could you have  Could have a probability of I the square root of -1.  How is that all for you? Think about the things I want right now just steal from this picture. Now the trouble with this picture is it doesn't lend itself to moving over to a continuous idea very quickly. So the first thing I'm going to do is take away the bars and just put. At those Heights the same thing as a bar.  Okay. So now the heights of all the. That up to 1.  and higher. Mean more probability  So we still retained a lot of things there. No dots below the axis. But as soon as I draw that with thoughts, you probably have an emotional feeling about what you should do on how to make a continuous random variable. See right now. We're only allowed to put dots above these integers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on but if suddenly we were allowed to put dots over all the smooth values between 0 and 16 you can imagine what you do here.  Okay. So along the y-axis before we do this, I want to point out then in the picture in the upper left the y axis measures probability.  That's how you probably already been thinking about it, right?  So what we're going to do now is draw smooth curve through everything and that's how we would transition to a continuous random variable just allow the axis here to take on any possible value, which means I'm allowed to put a dot above every possible x value, which means I have a beautiful curve.  There's just a few problems here when you make this transition one is it this axis will no longer be called probability. And this is the hardest thing for people right there. We're going to come up with a new word a lot of people use the word density.  Some people also use the word likelihood.  So I think it's better to start with density cuz you have no idea what that even means likelihood in your soul feels a lot. Like probability How likely is something how probable is it? The word density have dents this up like you don't have an intuition about that. So it's good to choose a word that you have no intuition about it first.  Okay, so  Here's the key thing that's going to happen. Now. This is going to be our tool anytime. You want a continuous random variable. We're going to have to draw a pretty little smooth function like this.  And that's going to be our cool to help us do anything we want to do we have to figure out how to use it.  Okay, so before when we had a picture.  The heights of these dots or the area if you think back to this picture with bars represented probabilities. So what we're going to do is steal the idea that areas are probabilities and we're going to pour that over to this new setting where we have a smooth curve here.  Okay. So here are the important things first of all about this function and then we'll talk about the finding probability this function. I just drew is known as a probability density function. Some people call this a PDF just different than the file extension on your computers.  So probability density function is any function. F for us that has these two properties. First of all, it better not be a negative ever. So f of x has to be greater than or equal to 0.  And this is porting over this idea that the bars are the dots.  Don't live below. The graph is below the x-axis.  So this is one of the two conditions on any density function for continuous random variable. The next is when you integrate from negative Infinity to Infinity, you have to get one which is a generalization of the idea that all the bars were all the area of the bars sums up to 1  Now it's just wave area under a curve.  Yes, that's an integral from negative Infinity to Infinity. So just for call 20b.  Load it back up in your brain.  It's in your long-term memory probably now. She just want to push it back to your short-term memory if you believe in that view of learning.  And we're going to be doing a lot of dinner rolls is one thing you're going to find so it's 20 b was rough for you.  There's going to be some rough moments over the next few days. So you want to go maybe we learn how to do some integration techniques. For example, so here is a beautiful thing a PDF density function. How do we use it? How does it actually find probabilities?  If the y-axis is called density, we don't just use the height of the y-axis to do anything which is how we used to do things. So here's a new definition if you have a density function, and it's helping to model some continuous random variable called X.  then if you want to find probabilities related to X, here's the fundamental definition the probability that you're random variable X will spit out something between a and b  is simply the area under the curve the density function from A to B.  So we're still taking our visualization and thinking about areas to get probabilities. But now we have to do integrals to do them because we don't have this tiny little bars.  Will you can say how high is that bar?  Now we have a smooth The Zone and it seemed sort of believable.  I mean you used integrals to generalize the idea of summations to sort of infinitely many things. So you sort of summing up infinitely many heights which is what integrals sort of do but it's a little complicated. Now. This is a weird definition the first time you see it and you'll notice it. It's asking that a probability related to a Zone from 2 to 3, and we never really asked questions like that before but that's what other questions are going to feel like now.  Okay, so if you let X be the amount of water someone drinks and you want to know what the probability build drink between 2 and 3 oz and you have FX it somehow models at who knows how you got that? But if you got it, then you can just go in a great visit a natural question to ask about a continuous random variable.  If it's discreet, you ask questions. Like what's the probability someone is 16 years old. It's a very wise kind of thing rips continuous. You need to ask about zones another one more than 5 oz of water. Well just started 5 and just go forever. That was very unlikely. We'll drink a billion ounces of water, but the density function will show you that by being very low.  Very close to the x-axis. So don't worry if things seem impossible to you. The density function will take care of that. Okay, what about less than one ounce of water? Well, you start at 1 and you go to negative Infinity.  Now some of those values don't make any sense. You can't trick negative water in a day to pay. The density function will take care of that. It'll have a height of 0 which says that basically can't happen. So don't worry about it.  So we can all of these are on zones and these are harder questions. If this would have remap your brain and backed up with everything you've ever done in your whole life around probability has been telling probability of that thing right there.  You rarely ask Zone based questions. Okay, bility did some random variable that's continuous spits out the exact value.  That's the thing everyone in mediately wants to ask.  Well, you can transition that question 2 with the probability X is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a day. That's a slick way of saying you're a  And then you can use our definition which says all you do is just integrate from the number on the left of the number on the right and use the density function is the intermediary that will help you find the area.  Now the area under a function from a place to the same place is 0  hopefully this feels familiar from 20 be there's nothing there to find. Unfortunately the probability of any particular thing happening specifically defined Avery example is 0  Okay. So if I ask how much water you're going to drink today, cuz you're going to say number to me at the end of the day, right the probability. You said that number to me is 0 still happened. You drink that much water.  So in your mind in the past zero probability meant can't happen or impossible or something like that.  With continuous random variables used to remap it zero probability events happen all the time. I'll show you something that will help you believe this in a moment that helps you do things is not measuring probability. Its height is not measuring probability. The density graph is an intermediary that if you integrate underneath you can find probabilities. So this is the reason you started discreet things first and just green things. You can Define this function that immediately helps you find probabilities.  Okay. However, High it is that's a probability here. We have to go through some helper function called the density function, which is weird.  Okay.  Now it's the last thing we just talked about you need to be asking questions about intervals because of counterintuitive Point number one.  Asking questions about particular events at the most boring question. You can ask the answer is always zero. In fact, I'm almost every single exam in probability or Stat and almost every class around the country. There's always a question. What's the probability that a continuous random variable equals some particular outcome and should be instantaneous that you write 0.  But it really shows you who hasn't sort of turned over their intuition about these things.  Okay, so let me try to fix your intuition a little this is why I could so messy probability of 0 so in the past.  probability uses find assets ratio  and if a ratio of two numbers is going to come out to be zero.  There's only one way to do it.  If the numbers are dividing or finite.  Okay. So here we go. If this probability for zero back in the old days, it's cuz the numerator equal 0 and if the numerator equal 0 there's nothing in your event, which means it can't happen.  But if suddenly you allow infinitely many things possible.  Then it's possible the denominator could be zero or start infinity. And then that's it possible to get that race you to come out to be zero regardless of what's going on in the numerator. So that's why it's possible to create zero in two different ways. When you start allowing Infinity in your in your expression. So 1 red ball in a bag with infinity white balls.  Okay with the probability of pulling out this beautiful red ball according to this ratio should be won over.  infinity plus one  just basically one over infinity which is 0  so it's a zero, but you can still get the red ball if you just get Super Lucky, right so you can see immediately that the division by Infinity makes the whole thing come out to be zero, even though the numerator still has a thing in it. The one red ball that you're excited about.  So this is where the counterintuitive disappears. Okay. Now here's the thing that really gets weird.  In a continuous random variable the probability you get any particular outcome.  0  so it feels weird.  Because you say doesn't that mean everything is equally likely.  l a probability 0  so it's possible for things to be more likely than other things.  Even though they all have probability 01 Red Bull to lean balls infinitely many white balls.  Oh my goodness.  So what's the probability of pulling out a red ball?  in unison  What's the probability of pulling out a green ball?  Which color ball do you feel is more likely?  famous places many greens is Reds right of the same probability either probability 0  So this is the weird thing. Okay, so both of his hero. So one thing you can think about is if you have a continuous random variable versus density function that helping you think about it and the y-axis is not a probability its density. And so what it's showing you is if you think about two outcomes and we put them on the horizontal axis year the heights of the bars are telling you what's more and less likely relative to other things going on. They all have probability zero.  But the height shows you how desperately the graph wants to spit out a certain value relative to other places. So wherever the graph is high see this man in variable wants to be numbers around 7 through 9 somewhere in there more than it wants to be numbers over here at 4 and 12 and that's just based on the height.  So the height measures sort of.  Relative likelihood is one way to think about it. Okay this value 8.2 is more likely than 5.5.  So try to separate out probability, which is some sort of complicated calculation.  From emotional feelings of likeliness the emotional likeliness gets embedded in Heights the probability sum area under a curve.  Oh my goodness. It's very tough. The first time you see it.  So I might have you tried problem here just a little chemistry problem for all you people that love that.  So you're working at some chemical company and your job all days to do the same thing. Sorry.  Do you want to do different things everyday? Go get a PhD if you want half a day to be new things going to Masters going to do the same thing everyday?  Get a bachelor's degree.  Or don't get a bachelor's degree.  Here we go. All you do everyday is you taking samples and you measure what percent of the sample is iodine very exciting life.  Know the values you can get are between 0 and 1 you can think about him if the proportion of the percentage of the sample that's made up of iodine. So you can't have 200% iodine, right?  Okay, so you're wondering some questions about iodine concentration and it's the samples come in and you just scream out random numbers basically cuz the samples are sort of random coming at you. Now, here's a picture of this density function. I just told it to you in real life. You maybe after work hard at figuring that out. You'll notice it has a height of 0 most of the time. This is very common of sensory functions. This is the way to tell me that don't worry about those values. They're not really possible. The possible values are where the graph actually has a positive height.  Okay. Now when I look at this the y-axis is density or maybe likelihood.  and so all I say is the samples desperately want to be very iodine e  Cut the grass is highest ever see want to get things like point A to point 9.72. It's very hard to get things near 0.1 and 22 if the graph is in his high. That's how I emotionally feel when I see that picture picture rules out certain values and then it gives you a sense of the remaining ones relatively which ones are more less likely. So, let's see if you can do these find the probability of an iodine concentration between points 1.5.  And then find the probability you get something at least 5, we'll see how this goes. Push yourself 1 minute 30 seconds is what they should take.  So we started gentle I gave you something that shouldn't be too hard to integrate but you could see that could be a rough step, right? So according to the definition.  We just need to find a probability. So you can define a random variable called X if you wanted if you define it in words, it's the iodine concentration of a random sample.  You can't Define it in symbols because it's not a probability model that we have memorized of geometric and negative binomial. Those are all discreet. This is continuous. Maybe one day. We'll learn some of the common continuous once okay. So there's no way to define a simple jet. Okay. So this is the kind of expression you're being asked for and you set up the Senegal then you have to remember how to innovate you get X cubed. Hey, make sure you have the DX right here and make sure using an evaluation bar plug everything in and once you get your answer your soul should scream at you.  Check to make sure this is between 0 and 1.  Is your answer to be Infinity?  Okay, if your answer to be is infinity, you're not checking the probabilities are between 0 and 1. Okay, at least point five.  Okay. So here are the random variable X needs to be greater than equal 2.5 you could first set up the integral. It says f of x goes from 25 to Infinity.  Because f of x is partly 3x squared and partly zero.  Now what you can do is this refinement step right here, you can only think the density function and you can say anywhere where it is 0 there's no point in integrating. Chris will be no area. So I refined it. So the one with my upper bound and then I put 3x squared right there.  Okay, it's bad to have 3x squared and infinity is the upper bound. That is not what's going on here. It's 3x squared up to 1 and then is 0  So just be careful about what you're actually writing on the page. Even if you got the right answer a .875 make sure note notation Ali. You're not making any boo boos.  So that's what these problems feel like. You want to see what's going on. Okay, here's the area that you found in part A so that area is a probability and you're using the intermediary known as the density function is just a tool that tries to say How likely more or less likely everything is and you need that to increase the probability of any particular outcome is still zero so that tool sort of gives everything at once.  Okay, because this is 183 you will have order intervals to do if this were math 11.  Which is the interest at class for people of usually taking the 10 series they have easier intervals to do. So, there's a difference right there. You should be emotionally ready for so I'll step it up immediately with this. Here's a beautiful little thing the distance a freshman lives from UCSD. So maybe you to find some place you're going to measure from like the new tall pole. They just built. Okay. How far do you live from? The big tall is modeled by distance D function G of X. So again, you should say like there's some place where it will basically be above zero and then will be huge possible zones where it's zero. So it's zero for any negative X values know that should make sense when you see it.  The possible values for the random variable along the horizontal axis are they are negative Infinity to Infinity.  The density function will tell you that some of them are stupid and you shouldn't think about you can't live in negative distance.  From a pole because distance is a scalar positive idea displacement could be negative, but we don't have that here. Okay. So look good as the Bluegrass right there to the left of zero. If you look at this picture, it's saying most people tend to live close to the pole.  Because the graph is high above values like zero and small distance is for people to live more than a mile from school is much harder. The graph is much lower.  Okay, these are all like the big commuting people that come from like Escondido or something better way out there on the right side of the graph.  So there's a picture that's how you should feel about when you see it. So first thing just because I threw a function on the board doesn't mean it's a valid density function. So must meet two conditions to be valid density function also just cuz I throw a function up doesn't mean it actually models what I say it does.  I mean you looked at this and maybe a little bothered you like. Okay, if I look at this and it's in miles it says most people live half a mile from the center school and look all the areas. Basically they are.  I really feel right. I mean what percentage of this campus is commuters they all live more than a half-mile away. Right? So my picture may be wrong and on top of that it may not even be a valid density function used for modeling in the first place. So first thing we need to do this one so we can have to do an integral and we need to function to never dip below.  So we need to argue both of these now if there's a picture in front of you if you believe the visualization then it's not hard to convince yourself. It's non- that is zero or positive. Okay grocery list and exponential functions are always positive.  0 is greater than or equal to 0 we done it. So the hard thing is usually showing the area. So here's what I'm going to do is first just set up the interval under the density function in G here.  Cuz that's the name and I'm not going to put 5 * e to the negative 5 x in until I restrain myself to the Zone where that's really true. So we were find the integral.  And basically ignored all the places where was 0 now. It's been a long time since you probably did one of these.  What kind of integral is this?  Improper, how do you correctly solve improper integrals?  Would you say?  Oh my goodness.  What do you think?  Swap the upper bound the Infiniti the nastiness for a variable and then have the variable go to Infinity by a limiting process good that is what you need to do in this class. If you do not do this you will lose points. I guarantee you.  This will occur on exam 2 you will lose points.  Now in time you will stop doing this for easier things, but I want you to get in the process of doing this now. So when really messy hard things come up, you're like, oh, yeah. It really helps to have this in here.  Okay not choose your favorite letter. I choose n  if interest tea or whatever you're reliant on already based on what happened in 20 be so this is how you make a proper integral out of something in proper. So now you focus on the integral and you worried about the limit later.  Okay. Now you probably look at this eat in the negative 5 backs and you know, it comes from itself. Cuz when you differentiate exponential's they give you back what you started with basic late and it's a little complicated. All the signs right? I've done this interval probably five hundred times in my life. So I'm good at this now, but it it's a little hard when you first do it if you want to make sure and check that this works just differentiate it and see if it gives you back the integrand.  So when you differentiate it spits out an extra -5 from the chain rule which combines with the negative sign in front end makes a positive five.  Now we need to plug in the bounds.  Plug in the upper bound subtract what happens when you plug in the lower bound and now we'll take the limit. So is n goes to Infinity the exponent. He Ronnie actually goes to negative Infinity Andy to the negative Infinity Acero.  So then you're just left with either the zero which is one and all the signs work out and give you one.  So this is about identity function. Is it a good model for what's going on? Who knows? That's more complicated. That's like a 181a be kind of question.  But I do next hour.  3 diet  that was interesting about this graph going to come up all the time. You see this is going to be one of the most common things we use.  This doesn't go up to Infinity here. It just goes to this point 0, 5. Okay, so you have to like look carefully at the pictures and make sure you don't put emotional things on them that are really true.  Great. So now that we have this, let's see if you can do some things.  Probability of freshmen lives exactly 3 miles from school lives less than 1 mile. How far on average do we expect someone to live?  from campus  Okay using uppercase.  Okay, what you forgot to say immediately. Could you write some notation on it? Like he of x equals 3 equals 0  honesty here  The question is less than 1 mile. So if you actually wrote an expression with a probability, you would have written a less than sign right there.  Not a less than or equal to sign that most of you probably didn't write that cuz you just jump straight to the interval, right? The question is does it matter whether this is a less than sign or less than or equal to sign.  Well, it doesn't okay, you're worried about the inclusion or the exclusion of x equals 1.  How much area does x equals 1 contribute?  0 area, so don't worry about it cero area inclusion Rex pollution  Okay, you solve right about here that like the probability or the amount of area above a single point is 0 so doesn't matter if this is less than or less than or equal to or any of any of that nonsense. Now the last one you probably like I don't know how to do this.  And that's because you don't know how to do this yet.  This is asking for the expected value as the word X backed might indicate and we don't know yet how to find the expected value of a continuous random variable. So we're going to have to wait for this until right now.  Previewing it's amazing. Isn't it necessitating a tool? Okay. So this was our formula for discrete random variables, right and go through all possible values that can take on value in there. And then X How likely it is.  So here's a little more complicated because there's infinitely many things over a smooth Zone and submissions. Don't run over smooth Zone summations, like one and then two and then three with jumps. So summations are dead sweet tool if you never realize that about them, so is there any tool that helps us transition from just reach to continue?  Integration is the continuous version.  Of a summation. In fact, I'll have to do it take a summation which you could represent with the letter S and you can stretch it out and it'll look like an integral sign which is historically what happened. What happened? Okay. So anyway, I need to find the expected value for continuous random variable called Acts.  You go to all possible values from negative Infinity to Infinity.  And you say okay. I just like to take x and x them by the function f of x which is the density function. So it's a beautiful parallel. Okay, the summation you can be in a roll.  Summation was over all possible values of the integral goes from negative Infinity to Infinity been replaced by an intermediary called FFX that when partnered with an integral helps us understand what's going on. And so you can see the partnership appearing here. Now if some of the values are stupid and the random variable can't really take them on that's okay the density functional b0 and you won't have cumulated area in that section usually  So are summation is becoming integral and it's just a harder calculation than before and one thing you'll notice about this. It takes the density function x x that ramps up the difficulty of the integration step multiplying stuff by axe, you know how to integrate sine.  Can I hide a grade X time sign?  Oh, what's that turkey called?  Integration by parts. Okay. So anyway, if we go back to Hardy you would have needed to set up this integral which is x times the density function in the previous problem. It was five times using a -5x.  integration by parts  and it's improper.  whoa  KDs for hard 20V problems with a lot of notation eventually l'hopital's rule makes an appearance.  But more on that later, so this will tell us what we expect sort of an average as soon as you see that maybe your soul will scream out to you. What about that other thing? We always do a measure of spread. How do we Define that?  So back in the discreet world, we used this definition take every possible value. It's going to show up see how far it is from the average.  Square that to make it positive and then do a weighted average and multiply things by How likely they are to actually show up. That's what the probabilities doing. So if you're a big deviation from the center, but you don't happen very much. I really care about you when it comes to the spread.  So how we going to generalize this? Well, you could probably imagine what we'll do.  Will put it in a girl instead of a some instead of the probability. We will put the density function, which is the tool that helps us find probabilities. Then we'll take an integral that goes from negative Infinity to Infinity.  So this is one way to define the variance.  As you might expect this is a rough calculation.  You'll notice it uses munit the expected value from the previous slide which is itself an integral.  So if you ever want to find the variance first, you find the expectation known as Mew that's a hard integral and then that number it's plugged in from you here and then you haven't even harder in a x x squared effectively.  Oh.  So these problems take a lot longer than other things because of all the work that most everyone in the world uses almost all the time.  So I would not put this formula in your soul.  I only have it there as a generalization from the discrete version, but it doesn't make it the best way to implement it. So usually people find a variance with this formula.  So you need to do two things. You need to find the expectation of x squared.  I'll show you how to do that in a moment.  And then you need to subtract the expectation of x.  squared dramatic pause  now the cool thing is  you should already know this the evax if you're approaching the problem. Okay, you've got to find the expectation before you can go find the variance. There's no way around that.  Okay, so the only thing we need to figure out is how do you find any of x squared?  Okay, so  there's a formula for this and it's counterintuitive for some.  You notice if you have the variance, you can always take the square root to get the standard deviation. But the formula for E of x squared is defined right here. It's the interval from negative Infinity to Infinity of x squared times the density function.  Can you can prove that you can go between these two formulas and say math 180a if you want.  Okay, so what's nice about finding Eve x squared? Is it just a little easier than finding this very instant. Could you just * x squared?  You don't have to do x - Muse squared which makes a horrible mess in most settings.  Okay, so you'll do one in a row to find me you will do another integral to find Evac squared and then you package it all back together to find the variance and this will tell you how spread out a continuous random variable is  It's a hard calculation and there's just no way around it.  So if you want to see who's good at symbol pushing in a class, you put a variance problem on an exam.  That's just the truth of what you do cuz it requires a lot of stuff. So we'll try a little example here with a fidget spinner will see how we do.  flicker spinner  once it stops measure its angle from East.  Let's say counterclockwise like you do in trigonometry. You going to get something between 0 and 2pi, right?  If you assume each angle is equally likely to show up.  Find the average angle that you're going to get in the standard deviation.  Cat so here's a picture of what's going on. We spend this thing and the blue thing is pointing roughly Northeast and we've measured the angle here is the dotted line. Okay, and that's the random variable.  After spinning, what is your angle from East measured counterclockwise?  It could be anything right? It's going to vary from spin to spin.  So the first thing we're going to create our own density function. You never had to do this before.  Sew along the horizontal axis. You should think what the possible.  And I told you this problem to make it easier.  022 pi to Pi will destroy 0 for the density function.  Okay. So here's a picture of what sort of going on now the problem tells you everything is equally likely that is your eat just as likely to get the number one as you are Pie as you are 5.7. Okay, and took means the height of the graph is always the same.  Andrew zeros cuz it's not possible to have angles that are too big.  So now what are we going to do? We need to make sure this is a valid density function. So it has to meet the two conditions. Obviously. It's non- how do we get the area underneath it to be one?  Fred  This is sort of a hand.  divide 1 by 2 by  The integral I don't want to do another girl. That's too complicated.  Do I need an interval to find how much area is there and make it one?  Divide the density function. I'm trying to figure out the density function right now who doesn't exist made you a picture when I put it in some random height.  You have all the right ideas help.  Where do I use the word square?  rectangle  Okay. So the area of this rectangle supposed to be one. So the area of the rectangle is length times width, you know, the area is 1 so as long as you make the height 1/2 pi  and you know the bases to pie then they multiply to make 1 so that's how you set up your density function.  Now they're two things we wanted to do with this. We wanted to find the expectation and we wanted to find the standard deviation. I've done those here. We don't have time. You should work this before you try to start any homework. This is a nice practice problem.  But I will see you Wednesday. Have a good day. "
