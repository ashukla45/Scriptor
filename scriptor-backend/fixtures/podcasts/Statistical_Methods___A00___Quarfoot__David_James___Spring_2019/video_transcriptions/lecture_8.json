    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  And to those at home welcome so material and today's class will not be part of the exam on Friday. But Monday's material will so hopefully the ideas you see today will just continue building on Mondays to help strengthen that  I would advise showing up a few minutes early on Friday because usually I start a few minutes early. If you want a few more minutes, they're free you can take them.  Okay.  We don't have assigned seating for exams. So you can sit wherever you would like. I don't have the time to worry about touch issues in life.  That's the truth.  Okay.  Back to the common questions of The Human Experience. Let's see what we got to add some new things on. Okay first thing we've done geometric right here. Your goal was to take some Bernoulli process if a coin flip and do it over and over until you wanted to get your first success.  Okay, maybe you cared about How likely it was. It would take five trials or 15 trials or something like that. Maybe you just cared about what would happen on average?  Hey, so there's the geometric model the notice the parameters are requires some parameter P then we did the binomial model, which says okay, you're going to do this to certain number of times that's fixed.  Now I'm excited about how many successes you're going to get.  Okay, then you can tell me on average what's going to happen.  These are nice models in the sense that they focus on things that happen all the time in life keep going until you succeed sounds like a common question, right? And the other one is doing at a certain number of times what's going to happen. We only options in life is success and failure.  Okay, so let's try something. That's a little more complicated.  Sore next model is if you know the average behavior of some phenomenon, can you pull back out individual behaviors and How likely they are?  So this is kind of a cool movement because it goes from average back to specific or general to specific. Okay, so give me some examples that you probably feel in your life, you know, roughly how many emails you get a day.  But you know that it varies a lot. So some days you wake up like I did today and it was a miracle. There was Zero emails in my inbox.  The morning after 290 students were supposed to be submitting homework.  It may be one of the only time that's ever happened. But that's a specific behavior write 0 emails Pacific thing. And I know that I get somewhere between 20 and 50 emails a day depending on whether schools in session or not. Okay, you may know how many goals are scored on average in the soccer game and you may say could I see a 9 bowl game?  How likely would it be  So again General to specific guy and my friend is a Forester cares about forest fires and I suppose we do in California a lot. So the last one was based on his life and he gave me those data. Okay. So anyhow, all these things were here discussing an average rate and you can see by the units that it's a rate and all of those units look like some kind of event about what you were excited or not like an email or a goal or Force Fire / some sort of time-based idea. There's where the rate of peers and it's very important that the units on these be framed in a certain way that is idea. You're excited about or not for time.  So whenever we deal with this model, that's the way the units are going to come. Okay, now that time unit you could always change it up, but it needs to be sorted fixed for the focus of the problem. So it's a problem starts giving you information about per day than the questions need to be framed in a per day.  Although it's possible to move between them aren't you know what you're doing different units now, this is a probability model where I can't  Easily drive for you where we get the probability formula for geometric. We could watch the failures happening in the success and understand how we got que to the x -1 x p but here this is more difficult in an artichoke are some very complicated calculations. You don't do to 180 air. Sometimes graduate school. So the name from what model is this phenomenon is called the poisson distribution after miss the mathematician for so long.  Okay, here's the pronunciation for Saul.  There's a French for today. So this is useful anytime. You see a problem that gives you an average rate.  This is how you know to use poisson and your ass to pull out specific cases related to that. Okay, not the average rate. We're going to use the parameter Lambda Movin On Up in the Greek letter Universe one more Greek letter checked off.  All the people who Rush fraternities and sororities so I boring already memorized all the Greek letters and recited them a thousand times to my brothers and sisters.  But for all the people that didn't do that.  Get on board to come on don't just be like the American alphabet the Latin or whatever it is. Okay. So here's what it says.  The probability of seeing X successes or X examples of what it is you're excited about.  Define by taking Lambda to the x x e to the negative Lambda and then you / X factorial interior. Think about what exit is if you have some general sort of average behavior, and then he started asking about it. For example, you know, how many goals are scored on average in a soccer game and you care about goals the only possible value that the random variable could take on a 01 to etcetera. You can't have 2 and 1/3 goals actually scored in a soccer game. You can't have that number is the average across infinitely many soccer games but not an individual one. So this all the support it's the values that the random variable can take on and it's nice that those are integers because the denominator has a factorial  What are you going to do? What is 2 1/2 factorial?  later in life  My 181a students have to learn how to find 2 and 1/2 factorial but for another day, so we'll see how you do will put some set up here average number of goals in a soccer game 2.5 that is actually true.  If you can't both teams together, what's the probability of seeing a 0-0 game and the next one? Probably seen at least two goals. So give yourself 2 minutes push hard wake up.  What's gout?  First thing you should do to find a random variable. Give it a letter Capital. Hopefully tell me what it means or what it's representing queso hearx would be the number of goals should feel like a number idea score scored per game.  In soccer when you have the two sides together. Okay. It happens to follow a poisson model and you can write for us on right here and tell me what the average rate is. So 2.5 is playing the role of Lambda.  Okay, once you have that notation in place, then you can just reframe the problem and want the probability that x equals 0 which is 400 game is so then you just plug in all the numbers in the poisson probability formula.  And apparently 8% of all soccer games.  Should be completely scoreless.  It turned out that's actually quite close. If you click on this link, you'll see that 8.1% of all games in the Premier League if that's what you care about in life and scoreless.  Now this is interesting this shows you.  Did a lot of games if your light if your goal in life is to see scores are goals maybe soccer isn't a sport for you because of it what percentage and scoreless it however you like the hay and that gets you going in life and maybe soccer could still be exciting, but maybe you should choose your sport based on what you need out of a sport and how well it matches your desires in your soul.  Okay. Now maybe you need to see at least two goals. So here at asking the probably the x is greater than or equal to 2 again at least means greater than or equal to.  Now that's very hard to calculate.  Because you have to find the probability that x equals two or three or four or five Etc to Infiniti suit up to infinitely many calculations. So this is a nice place where you can use the compliment you can say, well we just don't want zero or one to happen and let subtract those away from 100%  This idea complementary probability of scoring on here. So we already have the value for p of x equals 0 that's up here. So you could have just put that in in all that was left was to calculate the probability that there's exactly one goal scored.  So 71% of the time your soccer experience will be two or more goals. Is that enough excitement for you?  So you got to talk to your soul and see what it needs out of your sporting.  And then go do some stats to see how likely you are to get what you need out of your sport.  so  I need crashes in violence in danger, which is why I watch almost exclusively extreme sports like snowboarding.  And all those other sports don't really have it for me soccer tsukemen gentle and kind.  Okay. Now what you can do you can fill out the information in a table if you wanted to see the totality of your experience in one visualization. So here's our probably table down the side of the support all the possible values of the random variable can take on here. It's not negative integers.  And you could start listing all of the probabilities if one wished calculate all of them and go on forever, but they're all going to the same form. They're dictated by the probability formula. So here's how you would get one. So slammed it to the 1 * 1 to the negative Lambda. I'm sorry to the negativland 2/1 factorial and you just keep feeling this in right and you get these different values.  Now I put 10 here just as a point of Interest. I could have put the general sort of x-value there if we wanted but I wanted to show you what happens if you dig deep deep into this table. And what passage does. Okay, when you have a number like 10, the 10 factorial on the bottom is very overpowering and it's crushing everything in the top. It crushes power functions, like raising things to the 10th or exponential functions.  And it's just one of the most brutal math functions. You can come up with in terms of its growth rate. So it's very hard to see a 10 bowl game in soccer.  Basically is what this is saying. Okay, here's a picture of what it tends to look like. It tends to sort of go up and then come back down.  You could see a thousand goals in a soccer game. The probability would be so incredibly small that it might take the age of the universe for it to happen, but it's still possible just with a small probability. Okay. Now you may think oh my goodness look at this will never see attend bowl game. But in fact there been five of them in the Premier League  about point 0 0 0 5 4 with the actual data show, which is actually very close to point 0 0 0 2  That's pretty amazing. That something is weird is soccer and sports which is almost Infinity variables.  Combining to determine what happens in a game fit so perfectly follow a simple distribution.  I love that.  It's life isn't so complicated to model after all is it well Sports aren't probability formula probability of any particular specific outcome when you know, the general behavior of the phenomenon, that's Lambda. Now. The question is what happens on average and what kind of spread out and experience soccer games. Maybe that's what you wanted to use to make your decision about what sports you love in life. So it turns out  Does the excitation is Lambda in this is not unbelievable. If I tell you if an almond on is modeled on average by this number and then we build a model around the average called Linda and then I asked you for the average.  I'm hoping they're going to say Lambda right back at me.  Seems pretty natural what's not so obvious is the standard deviation which will turn out to be the \u221a lamb. This is not easy to prove at all.  So funny how these are two facts you're going to want to know and if you want to go prove them course like 180 A1 Spire you to proving these kinds of things if it's a good one Ada class.  Another thing that's a weird is the following the units on these answers the expectation the random variable the standard deviation, they all measure the idea and the problem which is how many goals are getting scored even though you build it on gold per time, which is Outlander get set up. So you have to think about Lambda initially at the unit list ideas what I was okay, if you just took the units from Landa.  It's a little weird here. Do you want to start a strip away its denominator forget about the time when it's embedded in the problem, but I asked you the expected number of goals in a soccer game. You should just say like 3 and 1/2 goals or whatever. The answer is you shouldn't say it's going to have goals per soccer game 30 built into the question and if you take the square root, you can take the square root of the units.  I want to know how spread out the goals are for soccer game you be like it's going to be about two and a half, but I could see it going up to you know, 1 and 1/2 more than that or one-and-a-half less. You don't take the square root of the units. So units on expectation standard deviation and the random variable all aligned.  Okay. So anyhow, if we look at this setting listening about soccer is this good enough for you on average are going to see about two-and-a-half goals. Do you like the average? There's enough excitement then if we go up and down the standard deviation hear 1.5 is standard deviation. So if you go up and down one standard deviation from the mean, these are pretty common experiences. So most soccer games are going to go to you're going to see between 9 and 4 goals.  Does that feel like your experience?  Does anyone watch soccer?  Most popular sport in the world and America doesn't care.  Just shows how misaligned the views of reticular country and a particular issue could be relative to the world doesn't make it right or wrong to shows a misalignment. You finally arrived at the negative binomial. So this is getting a little fancier. We're going to contrast it with the geometric. So geometric you're doing a Bernoulli thing over and over till success and which have your success you stop and you say how many did it take and you go home and you have a cocktail and that's it. That's all geometric is but you could say what if we wanted a bunch of successes?  And after I got enough of them, I'd go home. So hear the question is what the probability of getting K successes.  That's what you want in life.  And you want to keep going until you have your case successes and you're wondering what's the chance that happens on these stay in trial? So if my goal were to shoot 3 basketball free throws, that would be the role of K, and I was going to stay after practice and keep shooting in shooting until I got my three.  Now you might say what what's the probability it takes me three shots to do that. What's probably it would take 14 shots. Could I do it in Two Shots? No, cuz I have to get three successes. Right? So the number of times it takes to finally get all your successes in life. That's 80th and here that's what it's measuring.  Now it's geometric in the sense that you're going until you have a certain goal achieved in life. But the goal is no longer one success. It's K successes where you'll choose what K is in life.  And text you later show in like 180a that negative binomial supposed to sum of a bunch of geometric ideas. You just want to succeed and then okay you have enough success is no fine until you get enough success strings together.  Okay. Now it's awesome going to feel a little binomial because you see the letters K&N going on.  And those were the exact letters we use in the binomial but what's different is the structure in binomial say I'm going to do this thing is fixed number of times and what the variable is how many successes occur?  But in negative binomial what you're doing, is she saying I need this many successes.  And what's variable is how long it takes to create that?  But when it's all said and done you will have K successes.  And that's absolute so it's a mixture sort of of those two emotions.  Okay, so let's try something when you can see how this works.  20% chance a randomly-chosen UCSD student with an engineering major  soundtrue  Do you know anything about the distribution of breakdown of the stem majors at UCSD?  No, that's roughly true. You'll believe me. Anyway, who cares will first fix the number of people to whom they will speak. I'm going to go speak to 7 people.  And then the question is about could you see three who are Engineers? Could you get three successes?  You'd love to c36s is it may not happen?  So it's sort of variable there. Okay. So this person sets up a random variable called acts. It's based on a binomial distribution. They're definitely talking to seven people and the chance of rain in one of those says, yep. I'm an engineer is 20% and what exit is measuring is how many people actually turn out to be engineers in your group of seven. So the possible values expert Akon or 0 through 7, depending on how lucky your day is  Okay. Now what you're excited about.  Is getting that Randomness to show up at 3.  And then the binomial model says here's the probability that I happens.  Okay. Now if it is negative binomial coefficient is negative binomial then what you want to do is say I must see three Engineers. That's all I care about in life and I don't care how long it takes or how many millions of people have to talk to.  I'll go have a cocktail after I've met three.  What's the probability you meet the third one on say the seventh person? So this again use this numbers 3 and 7 but it's different. Okay. So here you set up a random variable called negative binomial.  And what's going into the model that you absolutely know is your goal in life of seeing 3.  I can there's a 20% chance of rain a person will identify this way and you're amazing the letter Y and what it represents is how many people you ended up having to speak to in order to get your three successes in life.  Okay, you might get lucky and do it in three. It might take a thousand.  What you're interested in is just the probability that it takes seven.  Right now that's what we're interested in. So give me ideas that are known as sort of fixed or different between the two even though so much of the notation can overlap.  So how do we figure out this probability? This is where it gets interesting. So first, let me give you the probability formula so we can all sort of have this down on paper.  If your goal is to get K successes, and you going to keep doing it until you get your case successes the probability that will take n x exactly.  is n - 1 choose K - 1  so this another reason is called negative binomial. It uses the binomial coefficient in it, but a slightly different than what we were saying in the binomial model.  time speed of Decay you can probably understand why this is appearing if your goal in life is to get K successes this expression sure looks like they're K successes cuz it's obsessive probability p  Now if there's an trials, there's some failures that happened in your journey, right? And that's what the 1 - P2 the end - K is effectively creating.  So the only mystery then is that choose symbol in front and why it is the way it is.  Okay. So what's explore this through an example? Let's say you wanted of three successes and just going to keep going and going until you get them.  So what's map out what it looks like if that just happened to Take 5 times you had to flip a coin five times to get your three Tails. Okay. So what happens visually is if you stopped at 5, it's because you finally had the final success on the fifth attempt.  Okay, so when I map out with possible the last column must be all S's cuz that's when you quit.  Now what happens before that?  Is where this is interesting so we have these four trials.  In black hair and what remains is to jam a certain number of successes into them?  Now it's a goal is to get three and we've already accounted for the third one and green. Then we have two more to fit in these spots and black. So the number of spots we have here is effectively and minus one cuz we used one of them at the end here for the final success and the number of successes we have yet to place.  Is Kmart this one because the final success is in green?  So what's going on when I list all the things that could happen in order for this process to end in five steps. You can see things that must be required like all the greens are here. You can also notice that there's different ways to create this which is why I had different possibilities listed.  So the only thing that's interesting here is how many things are on this list? They all have the same probability. Look at they all have three s's in two F's and that's what Pete of Decay 1 - P to the end - K is representing those successes and failures. So the question is how many things are here? And that's where we're getting the N -1 choose K - 1 all it saying is you must put the last spot is ass that leaves n -1 holes.  You want to know how many ways there are to dump the remaining successes into them?  And that generates big long list.  Okay. So again, this is grabbing the number of things I've listed here and the probability statements are saying okay. Well How likely is he should be and they're all the same likeliness.  So this is where the formula comes from and if you have some experience with counting this argument feel quite natural and you see the derivation some people may not be ready yet to really grasp this with the chew symbol. Okay. So for those people grab onto the formula now learn how to use it and in time you'll get better with the chew symbol.  So now let's put a little table to everything.  So what values are possible your goal in life is to get K successes.  And with your measuring here is how many times you have to do something for that to occur? So you'll notice first and my table the smallest value possible is K if you want to get 13 heads, you can't flip the coin 12 times in the Chiefs at  the smallest number of times you could flip it is actually K. The other thing to note is this could go on forever if you're the unluckiest person in history.  Go get me three heads how I flipped Infinity tails.  Just not my day, huh possible to zero probability event. Okay. So what we just did is we found the general formula here.  Now you can imagine what happens if we plug in pay for the value of n o r k + 1 into the value n can you just get some expression?  Again, it should make sense in special trivial cases. So just the first case neck make sense. Your goal is to get K successes in the first row says you did it in K trials.  But that seems like a strange thing, right you must have succeeded every time in life. You have the best luck.  And in order for that to happen to have a success on every trial. There's only one way that could ever be created succeed.  And then you just need all the peas to come to your Aid so that's why you get Pita 2K.  Okay, and you can fill in some of these others. You just get messy formulas. Okay, it's not really interesting to put all these in but this is what the probability table looks like. And yes, it's getting a little more complicated.  But the reactions you should have to that is not.  HB look at me look how amazing I am look what I can write and understand and the tools I can use so embrace the power that beautiful beautiful complicated mathematics gives you I want to see a picture of what's going on here is where the negative binomial tends to look like.  You can see here that there's a big hole on the left side of the graph. Okay, it doesn't start till the value k2k would be where this first bar is above and then it could go on forever. Eventually the graph the blue bars are so tiny that you can't see them but they're still there and I can't draw the graph forever because the screen is finite, but you should feel that it goes on forever.  Again, the x-axis is measuring how many trials it took?  To get the key successes that you wanted in life.  So we have the table we have the visualization.  Now you're ready for the fact sheet.  So what's going to happen on average?  Well, it turns out.  It's just k / P. Okay is how many successes you wanted?  Auntie is How likely they are.  As soon as you see a fancy formula reduce it down and see if it makes sense in Trivial cases. What if your goal in life or just to get one 6s?  What are two ways to think about it one is a negative binomial. That's very boring.  Your goal is to get one success plays the role of one and you get the Formula 1 / P the other way to think about it is so if it's just one success that's called the geometric model.  And if you remember what happened on Monday the expected value of the geometric model one of her pee, so I am starting to trust this formula because in Trivial cases are collapses down to what we know. In fact, since negative binomial was one kind of generalization of geometric. It makes a lot of sense that we got k / P. Okay. What happened to your \u221a KQ / p  Well, if k equals one this formula should collapse down to the one we have to the geometric and in the geometric we have the square root of Q / p and it does so I trust these formulas if you don't trust me.  188 you can go prove everything.  That's how you develop That's a Some people develop belief in things.  Do you pull your belief in what I say?  But the textbook say is what you can prove yourself.  Where do you draw conviction from in life?  So here's one. I love people actually do this in sports in Worlds.  The chance to Joanne conserve for tennis ball in on a random shot is 20% makes one out of five after practice. She's going to hit shots over and over until she gets 10. You probably heard Pros to do this. Maybe LeBron will take free throw shots after practice until a thousand such shots were made.  Kate before you said technical you might want to know what's going to happen on average. Okay on average how many shots will it take to achieve this and how much variation is?  What's going to happen? If you do this every day after practice, I love this kind of question. It's so easy to answer when she have a negative binomial model here K. The number of successes to Joanne wants this number that she chose 10 doesn't mean it's going to take shot 10 shots could take a thousand shots or 11 if it's a good day. So on average if you just divide K by p50.  Do you want to sit there and do something 50 times on average?  okay, so normally what you do is you could try to say what what How likely am I to get it in guesstimate p  then you say like, well what I want to happen on average, how long do I really want to be here every day? Okay, that's his number 50 right here. And then you could back drive with your goal should be in life. That's how you really should do this if you know negative binomial model. I'm okay. Another thing I'm worried about is how spread out your experiences will be so he could take you over P formula and we get some value 14.14.  Okay, so an average intake safety go up a standard deviation and down one. That's pretty, you can go a couple standard deviations. I would also be a really common experience.  Okay, so things between 36 and 64 is a real measure of what's going to happen in your life.  Does anyone actually do this in your sport?  No one stays after practice.  swim practice no golf  What are you do?  Okay. So your goal is your success is within 3 feet.  You're doing chip shots. And your K was 50.  What's your probability of getting a random Chip Shot within three feet of the hole?  30% point three so you do 50 / 0.3 at the end of practice every day on average. That's interesting. I love it. That's about a hundred fifty. So then you can multiply by the time interesting. Okay. So here we go. He bought it off the internet on Fair coins.com.  And his goal is to get five heads.  What's the probability?  Did it will take exactly 6.  or exactly 7 times  for those five things to show up in life on average. How many flips will it take? Good luck with push push.  Remember to find a random variable first.  Remember all that stuff about events and or statements. They appear. So this is an event sort of the event that it took exactly six times to get our five successes. And this one is it took exactly seven times. Now the reason you can just split up the or here is because those are disjoint if I go and start flipping this coin trying to get five heads. It can't take both 6 and 7.  It's one of the other something happens to me when I scream out. The number of times it took I'm not going to scream out.  Text Evan when you do that.  So that's why you just put these out now. These are just horrible calculations. You just plug things into formulas.  And you just get some answer. So one thing you want to do is make sure you can practice on the calculator device that you'll have during the exam. So you're used to doing these two symbols. Some people don't have a choose button on their children. They go back to factorials totally fine.  Okay, so use this opportunity to practice these things and not model could handle these two different cases some people trying to set up to model. So you don't need that. I love it when people to find things in words. Also this right here x equals negative binomial table side, that's symbols. But if you write it in words, you would tell me something like x equals.  the number of Trials it takes  to get 5 successes.  If the coin heads is .4 that's what it means to write it out in words and it helps to do that cuz it reminds you like what is variable what could change how many trials and take the five is definitely fixed that your goal in life. So it doesn't vary. So the random variable is not about the number 5. It's about the number of Trials. It takes to get that.  Okay here we just became a overpaid on 12th and a half. No, no, you should not round expected values.  Their power is in the fact that they have lots of decimal places and they can expressed you what's going on on average and they're not constrained by integers if that's what you love in life.  What is the danger and all these problems is it's so tempting to just be a formula machine.  The quality comes in your answer when you start putting things like this excess Distributors as a negative binomial random variable and you remember that X is measuring something and X could take on different values and if I'm just happened to ask about 6 or 7 randomly.  can you see what things are fixed and how to model things and what could very  So now you've seen the big four models.  They're all discreet. That is the values they can take on have spaces.  So for every single one of these there's a lot of facts are going to want to know so first what parameters does it need to get set up. So geometric just needs the success probability.  Of your Bernoulli trial now X measures the number of attempts that it took to finally get your success in life and it counts also the success. So the possible values of could take on our use this notation right here for X belongs to where's an element of or must be one of the following things either one or two or three and you notice it can't be 1.5. That's why I called Just Beat cuz of that hole right there.  So what does it measure what is it support? How do I set it up? You also want to know the expected value and variance or standard deviation?  Okay, so I haven't put those here because otherwise it gets out of control too many things on the side binomial if you think about what's possible and what it's doing. It's saying first when you set me up. Tell me how many times you going to do this thing at the end tell me how likely each of these things is to go success vs. Failure what I will measure for you.  Is how many things flipped to success tax accounting and the only possibilities or something between 0 and end because we're constrained by the number of trials that you were doing which is and which is fixed.  Kaepa song when you set me up tell me what behavior is happening on average. This land. You should know is a weight and you're measuring something as the numerator units per some unit time does the denominator units.  Okay. Now what do I spit out? If I know on average what's going to happen? I spit out the number of events the number of goals in a soccer game. The number of forest fires that will happen this year. The only possibilities are integers starting at 0 and going forward again to squeeze. You can't have one and a half goals scored in a soccer game or one-and-a-half forest fires or one-and-a-half presidents or one-and-a-half tweets.  You should be looking in the problem for something that mentions an average rate. There should be some sort of time units also embedded in the problem.  And then finally negative binomial when you set this up tell me how many successes you want.  And How likely are given trial is to turn to a success? What I will measure is how long that takes before. We finally have all the successes you desire in life. So the smallest thing could ever happen is it takes K trials to get your case successes. You're the luckiest person ever but it could stretch on to Infinity. Although it becomes increasingly less probable.  Okay, and what we're measuring again the family can vary from one person to the next is how many trials it takes?  We're all hoping for the same amount of success in life.  Now when you put them all together this gets hard.  You have so many options to choose from obviously. The last time we did was negative binomial because we just talked about negative binomial. There's none of them dangerous and education is the study of thing. Then you do homework about and you know, when you're doing the homework about the thing you should be using the ideas. You just saw a right, but then the exam comes along and suddenly the field looks big and wide and they're just no more of that context clue stuff.  So when you study for exams.  This is one of the things you should do remove the context clues of all this problem was in this section. Hence must use these tools mixed up the problem take your homework set print them all out cut them into pieces and solve them randomly mix them all together resolve everything when you do the practice exams.  Okay, treat them like, oh, I can't go look in the book and see or anything like that just feel like what is this from and work on that skill? So that's what we're going to do now. So on all these problems first described as appropriate.  And then you need to decide what it is. The problem actually cares about.  Okay, so here's an example. We use our Women's Water Polo team in a recent season. They at 385 goals in 39 games.  Someone could ask what's the probably the score exactly 2 in the next game?  Is there actual day that I went on the internet and looked up our Women's Water Polo team?  I played water polo before but I stop playing when I dislocated my shoulder. I was sick of it. He played goalie in water polo. It's very dislocating knee.  So what you have to move fast anyhow, so what is the problem when I read this what I see is them said incumbent average rate. Okay, they do it by giving the total number of goals over certain number of games. But if I divide those numbers that gives me the rate I care about  this one's easy cuz we just did soccer goals, right?  But they're using the fact that I did soccer goals to help set it up. If you look the fact that you're given a time-based idea.  Again, however, many minutes out is and some idea or excited about what you really want to measure that's how you know, you should use poisson. So Women's Water Polo UCSD is very goal heavy event 9.87 goals in a game. That's very exciting to watch.  Okay, so then you set up your purse on model. Okay. Now I still really haven't looked at with a question once yet.  Do that after you set up your model. Okay, once it's in place now, you know exit the number of goals in a random game. It could bury and then you say what do they want two goals in a game and then you just say probability x equals 2, then the formulas come out so think about the formulas last.  Now that was one of the many things that could be asked about. So here's the table and I'll just give you a high-level sense of what could be asked about. Okay, you want to make the easiest question possible?  And you want everyone to get in a you asked about a single row cuz most people can do that.  Okay, you can make it harder by asking say about multiple rows.  Okay School score fewer than three points in their next game.  So then you have to understand how to convert those words over to an expression. Then you have to be able to add up multiple rows in the table. So this is starting to get into decoding of words and phrase ology an English over to its magnetize version that can make things harder. You can ask what's going to happen on average and what you doing? There is effectively wanting the expected value.  Which is a weighted average across this table, if you know the expected value formula, that's not so rough and you can ask about how spread out things are.  Using some language about spread and then you want standard deviation which may or may not be combined with expected value so problems, they're already up as all the other things are for the first exam. If you want to like practice this and I made 10 or 15 questions after this if you want to go practice, okay, they're all about LGBT identification. Have a good day. I'll see you on Friday come early study hard.  Remember that you get a sheet of notes for the exam. You're allowed to ride on both sides 8 and 1/2 by 11. "
