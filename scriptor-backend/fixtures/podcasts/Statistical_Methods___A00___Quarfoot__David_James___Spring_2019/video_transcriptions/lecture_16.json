    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back. Happy Monday.  week 6  over the hill in the class, right?  Summer is coming. You can feel it winter is also coming if you watch Game of Thrones.  But don't spoil it for me.  I mean episode behind anyhow.  A few little potpourri topics to pick up today and then we have our exam on Friday. Hopefully you've already been studying for this.  We will see.  I put a bonus question on the exam.  It was originally a question and then I was like this too hard.  So we turned into a bonus.  So there's a chance to get above a hundred if you're  get excited about such things.  Okay, so here's where we are. We had a mystery population.  But you're a sample of size n from it. We took those in data points and we averaged them together. When you do that, you get one average. That was one green. You can imagine repeating this infinitely many times or perhaps 10,000 huge amount that would show you the picture of what's possible for X bar skull the sampling distribution. Hey, we learned all sorts of things about the sampling distribution. The most important thing was that it was normal.  And we had a certain spread for it. I was called the standard error and realist turn Center but here's the cool thing about this whenever we did that before at the very top and blue. I will draw on normal distribution when after a bunch of work we get back normal distribution. That is if you start with something super nice and you do sound process to it.  Maybe not surprised you get something nice in there.  So one of the most important results in all of Statistics to call the central limit theorem, it says the distribution of xbar the picture and green you get here is approximately normal regardless of what population distribution you start with up in the cloud here.  This is a pretty profound result. And in fact, the green curve looks more and more like a normal distribution that the more more data you use in your sample size. You're going to be repeating the process infinitely many times with the question is how many data are you pulling down out of the cloud?  Okay, so if the population you start with is really skewed.  So maybe have an exponential distribution up here in the cloud?  So that's fine. As long as you have a large enough in size to sort of counteract the weird Behavior starting with  the first time I saw how incredibly powerful this was but sitting in a machine learning class and the professor said basically everything in life is normal.  Roosevelt stand by that and he said the reason is most phenomenon in life require the combination of lots of different factors and they all get averaged together if you think about what determines a human's height.  I just found this on NPR the other day Omni genetic the word that they use for this basically it's influenced by all of the genes.  Whatever that meant, maybe it's Fantastical but there's a lot of jeans in the body, right? So you can imagine something that has sort of an average out of fact across thousands or hundreds of thousands of influences. And if that's the case then what you have basically is an average year.  Across actually lots of different populations, but you have an end value this very large so doesn't matter any of the particular influences are very strange when they all come together an average you get something nice and normal now, let me show you a picture of what's going on. Maybe this will help you. Okay. So the top there's three different populations was a different blue curves. Okay, so you might be drawn from the population that's uniform. It wants to give you values and some Zone equally likely  Now if you just dropped two people from this blue universe and average in this together you get an average and if you infinitely many times you would get a green sampling distribution. Okay. So here's a picture of what's going on Below in red. They've drawn a perfect normal curve and in blue, they've drawn the sampling distribution, if you take two data average, mm and repeat that infinitely many times.  Okay, right below at the drawing five different date of values from the uniform at the top there averaging those 5 together to get a single result. They repeat that infinitely many times and you can see they got a blue curve. That's the same thing distribution. And the right again is the theoretical it's a normal distribution.  And you can see how nicely these align. Okay, so doesn't matter if you start with something uniformly distributed after the averaging process you get something normally distributed.  Okay, just exponential. This has some skew not crazy.  And you can see if you take two things from this blue and a virgin and repeat that infinitely you get a sampling distribution. That's not that normal doesn't overlap with that red curve that much right, but if you draw more and more data for your sample, by the time you get to 30 datapoint in your sample and you a virgin all together and repeat it infinitely the sampling distribution is looking really normal.  So as long as you're doing samples in life that are pretty big.  Roughly 30 or higher. You don't really need to know the population your drawing from it's irrelevant.  Because averages have the ability to overwhelm weird behavior and make nice clean normal behavior.  Which is why that professor said everything is normal. Now if you take something that's really skewed hear something called The Log normal distribution.  This is a horrendously skewed graph. So just taking a few datapoints from it and hoping their average is normal is not a good idea. Look out the disparity between the blue and the red as you get more and more data in your sample. Just starting to approach normality.  Okay, so this is the power of data I suppose.  It can wash away weird distributional effects in the average. So the more skew you start with.  Which is seen across the top then the larger the data size you need in your sample.  So that the distribution of xbar the sampling distribution is nice.  And the reason we need to discuss all of our study happens on the sampling distribution the blue curve down here which used to be green and our previous analysis. So he was the general rule of thumb.  That maybe you seen Anna stop before.  They maybe don't know your population. That's why you're studying it. Okay, you don't you have no sense of what the distribution is as long as you don't think it's that skewed.  Or maybe or like either could be a little skew.  You're fine. If you're starting to worry that the thing you're studying might be really skewed.  Then you have to be really thoughtful about how many people you put into your sample.  So, can you think of anything in life that are skewed?  Go ahead.  Income what were you going to say?  I'm sorry.  Left handed or right hundred a right-handed is not a quantitative variable. It's a categorical. I do identify in the binary is L or R.  Are you going to allow ambidextrous people?  That's a trinary but you're right in did it's lopsided. It's just not a numerical variable. So that would be good. So income is a great example of something that's highly skewed and America.  And I assume that we're going to think about this in America for sack. So if you're doing things like income inequality, maybe need a sample size of 30.  So do you feel like you're asking enough people so  you will have sort of averaged out any weird people at the extreme end. Like if you have a sample of 2 and Bill Gates happens to show up.  What an unlucky sample for you, but if you have a sample of 60 and Bill Gates shows up think it's averaged away by everybody else roughly and the behavior starts to be under control if you have some extremely skewed phenomenon.  Like income in America, which is not just cute but extremely scared. Then you might need a hundred people in your sample before you start thinking that these two pictures the red and the blue or going to align  Okay, so there is some thoughts that say we can kind of a road.  The idea of normality in the population. It doesn't really matter that much as long as your sample size is Big that's why this framework is so cool about is conditions for doing any kind of inference. You want to build a confidence interval. You want to write a hypothesis test. Can you just always do it in Life or there ever any bad spots? You have to worry about what we just talked about one potential area for Badness.  So let's just make the big list here. Okay, so  We're going to list two conditions here.  The first is whenever you trying to do some kind of study the data that flow into your sample camping garbage.  Okay, if you want to know the average age of American and you decide you're going to sample at the retirement home.  This is a problem. Right? None of you were in the retirement home. You don't get counted somehow. They're so you need to make sure your data are with gold independent. So that means that if I know the value of one of the people in the sample, it shouldn't help me predict the value of anyone else in your sample. They should all be independent of each other as stand apart. If you do everything at the retirement home as soon as I know the first number someone was 75. I'm like, oh this is a scissor retirement home going on here. This is an old people all your numbers going to be big. It's going to inflate the average don't want that.  Now one of the troubles with listing, this is a condition in this how does one ever check such a thing?  It's kind of a weird Condition. It's a theoretical thing you love so usually instead of checking Independence because it's mostly a statistical thing people check these two conditions instead the randomization condition. When your choosing people did you choose them randomly that tends to make them independent of one another?  Randomness is the act of using no decision making process in order to select who's in it.  No, like directed process.  The other thing you want is the 10% condition so you don't want to ask too many people.  This is surprising for people because most people think bigger is better and that's true up to a point.  But then it actually starts to become a bad thing. So here's an example that shows why you don't want to ask everybody.  Not that you could anyway, so let's say I have these five tokens.  OK Google what special tokens and I give them secretly to five people in the class.  Okay, and we want to figure out what percentage let's save people have tokens.  Says we start asking people when I ask my first person. Did you get a secret token or not? I've no idea what you're going to say. I mean  Let's say that the interviewer has no idea what you're going to say. Right and we can just start going through people. Right and we're going to get lots of nose and every once in a while we get a yes.  Now it's some point if you dig too deep into the class all five of those tokens have been revealed.  So I don't need to ask anybody else cuz I already know what they're going to say.  So this is the danger in asking too deep into your population when it gets near the end. You already know what the answer is supposed to be because the population is constrained by the factors that built it there were just five tips. Once we see all five. I don't need to talk to anyone. So usually people say don't dig too deep in your population as long as you're less than 10% you're fine and these are just sort of big rules of thumb if you want to know where that came from. Okay just comes from running different statistical simulations to see how far is too far to dig into a population.  Now usually you're sampling millions of your thinking about populations in the millions or billions. So 10% of that is still a huge number so you're not even getting close.  So there's the first condition Independence which you use these two conditions as proxies randomization and 10% The other is this  the population distribution better be nice.  Nearly normal and if it is the sampling distribution is normal as we just saw.  Although it's okay to a road that some.  Okay, it's okay if it's not that normal.  That is if you start to have SKU as long as you're drawing a pretty big sample size.  So how would you ever see the population distribution? It's not possible. Right? The only way to do that is to ask everyone and then as long as you're asking everyone.  You can just take their average. That's what you care about. Anyway, I'm guessing.  So usually what you do is you look in your sample. So look for near normality in the histogram of your sample.  the way I think about this last conditioning like to describe it these days is you need a good balance between the population skew  and the sample size  and the more skewed  the population is the larger the sample size and vice versa.  And the goal of this condition is really to make the sampling distribution in green come out to be normal.  Okay. So a lot of folks will say population must be nearly normal and we'll say here's how you're going to look for that in your sample and then we'll say it's okay if that's not really true. So it's a very weird condition with all sorts of quantifiers. So if you just think balance between skew and population size, this is probably easiest.  Okay, let's try to check in your conditions here.  So here's the setup. Someone want you to make a 95% confidence interval.  for what population parameter the average salary of all CEOs  There are hundreds of thousands of companies in the US. You're not going to talk to all CEOs.  Okay, so your friend randomly chooses 8  that's probably already a lot of work there it but how many people have to write to to get anyone to respond or how many companies you have to walk into and let me say let me talk to the CEO. Okay. So then she finds the mean of those eight to build her confidence interval and feels great.  What could be wrong what could fall apart in this?  Someone talked me through all the conditions.  Needed in order to do inference that is build confidence interval to run hypothesis test.  Brad  Okay, so you're worried about the distribution of CEO salaries. And you said it's probably not normal.  Okay.  It's okay if it's not normal if what is true?  Let me ask my question again.  You said that the population distribution of CEOs? It's probably not normal.  Okay soda CEO distribution in our sample is not normal. Okay, if the sample doesn't look normal, that's the same thing the same the population doesn't look normal because the sample and the population was supposed to look the same.  Okay. So now my question I'll ask again now. We've argued up to the population distribution of CEO salaries not looking normal.  Is that always bad?  It's hopeless you want to help.  Okay, so it's not that bad as long as the sample size is big enough to accommodate its weirdness.  So, how do you feel about our sample size?  Two small. How did you decide what to big into small was?  Okay, so does it matter how big the total size of us CEOs? Is it just matters? How big your sample is 8 you say is not a very big number.  This requires you had to emotionally decide how skewed you think it is and whether it is good enough for that skew this is a complex art question is a subjective if you want to rule because you like rules in life, then you can say about 30 starts to be good in most cases.  That's it. You want some gruel, but that's just an arbitrary rule someone came up with that gets put in textbooks. Okay. I have a friend who studies nothing, but incredibly skewed horrible distributions because fat tail distribution and he needs sample sizes of 60 or a hundred anytime. He does anything in life. But if you want to use the number 30 be my guest. Okay, so good barbecue. They were probably not counteracting with a big enough sample size.  Set one of the two conditions we failed so we shouldn't even go ahead and make the CI. What about the other condition?  Go ahead.  Perhaps they were randomly chosen. So you're talking about independence condition. She randomly chooses.  What's the other part of the independence Criterion when I get to actualized?  Oh my goodness someone help us.  Can you said it has to be less than 10% What's it the sample size has to be less than 10% of the population size. So do you think that there are more than 80 CEOs in America?  Is there something called The Fortune 500 which is the 500 biggest companies so they're certainly more than 80. So just take your sample size x 10 and be like this in more than that or did I do too deep?  Okay, so we basically are fine on Independence because of random choosing and 10%  but we probably have an issue here.  Now all this at this issues you you were talking about was all about one of those CEO salaries look like  well, here's a picture of CEO salaries.  I don't know if this is like some random picture I got from the internet.  Does this look normal? Probably not so crazy skewed?  Not that crazy skewed. Okay, the right Tales a little longer than the left. It's just calmly skewed now is 8 enough to compensate for calmly skewed. I don't know and whatever this is so unlike subjective question.  But usually 8 is not a big enough sample size. So because we don't really need the conditions. It means the green distribution the sampling distribution that shows with X bar. Looks like it's probably not normal.  It's probably a little messed up. So, let's see. See we're probably like right here.  They just about five the exponential looks a little like what we just saw so we would be living on the blue curve thinking we lived on the red curve.  Slappy garbage  should always know what curve you're on in life.  Okay, let's try some Socrative.  time for your phones  and it's been a minute since you were able to check them.  The weight of quarters in the u.s. Is normally distributed on average a quarter weighs 5.67 grams or that's its mass if you care about Wade versus math distinctions.  I set up a random variable called x what does it mean?  Does it measure?  Okay, so a is wrong because it's not a random variable to cook a random variable right? See you is wrong cuz it's not a random variable season number is right because it has weird random minute and it's talking about quarters, which is what's going on. The people that shows D. You're getting too fancy for something to be a sampling distribution. You had a sample.  I'm done something with your sample. There's no sampling going on here. We just talkin about quarters.  Uh, oh.  Probability that X is less than 5.67.  Select all that are true.  I'm glad people are choosing a this is for a standard way to think about things.  Asia straight from the definition of what this me percentages are the same things as probabilities.  One way to think about it. This distribution happens to be centered at 5.67 and its normal. So half the areas to the left, which is where she is true.  Cape Rd  as you saw in the solution there stop referring to non-random events as having probabilities. They don't  There has to be something Unknown about the process. I can pull out that quarter. We can stick it on a scale. It would either way more or less than 5.67.  Pick five random quarters average their weights make me a variable called why?  Hey, there we go. We're getting better.  You're learning how to write a random variable Expressions. So X1 is the first quarter's wait, it's random. It can be whatever it wants Adam all up / 5 now the people that chose to your trying to get antsy right there trying to know I could start with something normal and you average a bunch of them together. You can get something normal. The only question is where is it centered and how spread out it is.  Okay, and those people were just for getting a sigma over the square root of n?  Instead of Sigma over and which is what they were choosing.  Which is smaller.  Probability that X is less than 5 or their Y is less than 5.  Okay. See you in dear Temptation answers.  those would be right answers on a standardized test given by the  ETS or something?  So you probably started to read the description here in 5. That's I just need a random quarter to be less than 5 grams can happen.  Wireless in five, you need an average of a bunch of quarters to be less than 5 that's very hard to do because quarters want to be 5.67. And when you average them together, they desperately want to be 5.67 the average that is  So another way think about this. It's very easy for individuals to vary from their means, but it's very hard for averages to vary from their means  Because the averaging out affect cancels all high and low Behavior.  Gator not equal and we can determine it.  Okay, you can't even look at the different distributions going on. The average is normal 5.67.  But has a very tiny spread it doesn't want to vary.  Is another reason why elevators make sense? Okay when you build an elevator.  That broke for that cable holding up. The elevator can only take a certain amount of weight.  And then a bunch of people get in the elevator and of all the people weigh a lot. This could start getting dangerous, right?  But it's very hard for all of the people getting in the elevator to all be really overweight.  That's a rare rare rare event individual human beings can go up and down a lot on weight when you start averaging together or adding up a bunch of people. It's very well behaved.  So this is why elevator cable cords don't break in addition to tolerances and other things which of these histograms would be the least spread out has the smallest standard deviation or variance.  00 conceptual question no formulas to push around right just have to understand ideas.  So, what's the last question?  Hey, there we go. Now did you get it right cuz you actually understood or did you get it right through medicine making?  What's that mean, right? Okay, here's how the met a person thinks A&B feels similar C&D field similar.  So I know the answers in one of those two groupings.  Okay, then we have the small number is the big number small virgin versus the big the big probably feels like the better idea without knowing anything about what's going on. And then you just randomly choosing between the first A and B versus C and D.  Okay, so really there's just to answer choices b vs. D as long as you can feel out the smallness versus bigness argument. Anyhow, you probably saw the answer here and beer actually identical histograms. They pulling a hundred data and picturing them will look the same as pulling a thousand data and picturing them.  The histograms of a thousand or 10,000 here we'll just be taller. This will be more cases that the spread out in this will be the same. We'll just look try to look like the population. Are we doing average is right?  So you work all this formula how spread out or averages Sigma / \u221a end. So she make em bigger and makes the denominator bigger which makes the fraction smaller and that faction is the spread out.  Prince of quarters very skewed to the right.  Which of the following will have a histogram that is about normal.  There's two thirds of the room.  So this is also very conceptual when you draw data from a population and you picture it.  He'll do anything to the data the picture should look exactly the same as the original population.  That's why sampling works.  You draw sample because it's supposed to look like the original.  Not only in like it's emotional state but it's visualization and histogram now, if you do something to those data start averaging them together and repeating that process then you can get different pictures. Okay, so she is not great because you're only averaging together 10 things. That's much less than 30, which is what you tend to need to overcome any kind of skew but if you take a hundred data points averaging together now, you're creating a very nicely control Behavior.  Okay.  conceptual  I definitely need that data. Thank you for your data.  I actually asked for a Facebook just takes it.  Now I know what you're saying or feeling in your soul.  It's too early for all this. Hope you're feeling in your soul right now.  Now you're feeling I'm sick of talking about averages. That's all we ever talked about in this class. Right? What about all the other things in life you might care about  So why don't you think about other things?  So if you have this population you're excited about and you want to study its average the way we're doing. This is by calculating the sample and finding the average in the sample.  And then we eventually got good at lifting this back upright and creating confidence interval say it's and give us an Isis own where I think of you is instead of here's a particular number. I think knew you was near  then we're doing that process of lifting up. We came up with this confidence interval formula and you notice that uses the statistic that your best guess of what's going on and uses this thing called G star and the reason that's there is because the picture of X bar was approximately normal.  So that's what this d stands here for the normal distribution is what that thing looks like and the standard error. We need to know how spread out the X bar Universe was it would show us what was possible for X bar and help us gauge the variability. They're okay. So this formula right here turns out to be the formula in this case for means but it will look almost identical to the formulas for all the other situations that are about to rise in life. So for example, maybe you care about a proportion.  What percentage of people in San Diego identify as LGBT what percentage of people are going to vote for Trump in the next election Etc question all the time in life in this group of people if I give them a binary Choice how many people choose the first choice or the choice? I'm interested in. That's what portions are now we have the same problem as before. We can't talk to everybody.  So you draw small little sample. And in that sample, you could ask the people. Do you plan on voting for Trump? Do you identify as LGBT and you would have just calculated the statistic now, here's the first rating thing history history ruins everything historically when people were studying this they didn't put a Greek letter up here. Like we have over there Sarah greek latin strategy is about to break down. So what they did instead is the HP up here and then they put P hat down here. So this is notation. You're going to want to memorize and you'll do millions of problems about proportions in your life.  If you become a statistician until you use the sanitation all the time.  So the question now is how do we lift this P hat up to pee and give a confidence interval? So beyond moving beyond a point estimate?  Now it's not always going to be about Mew and P.  Don't get this binary in your head. There's other things you study in life correlations, which is some sort of numerical measure of how related to numerical ideas are. Is there a relationship between how many Twitter followers you have and how many Facebook friends you have? Assuming you have both platforms?  You might guess this is true that there is some relationship, right?  Now we could ask everyone on the planet whose on both sides for their numbers and we could go calculate something called the correlation or you could draw a small sample of your friends and do this. Again, we have the issue of populations and samples letters and both so when I go next door next. And teach 181b, we do a ton of stuff around the study of standard deviations. It's very painful but is also very sexy. You could do some of the coolest distributions that are out there.  Okay is the spread in the number of selfies that celebrities there? What is the spread on K?  Is there wide variability and how many selfies famous people?  Post or is it all pretty tightly controlled and they're all self-obsessed in post huge numbers.  I don't know. Okay, so it's sometimes I care about how spread out and experience is not where it centered.  Now the cool thing is the infrastructure. We've been using this going to generalize.  So here are the things that are going on if instead of writing xbar I write Point estimate.  The necessary helpful. Okay, that X bar was a point estimate form you if instead of writing the standard error formula here for the X bar statistics. I just say standard error of statistic, whatever it is.  The knot can generalize and this g-star here is the frustrating thing.  As long as the sampling distribution of whatever you're studying is is approximately normal, then we can leave that d-star there.  So what's going to happen is some of these issues are going to change over the next few weeks. They not everything we do in life is going to be under normal distribution. Sorry to break it to you. I know I'm horrible.  Okay, this is istat how spread out a statistic is. Well, we're going to go figure that out for every new statistic. We care about your sample.  We'll have to figure that out in the point estimate for the formula. So I'll see if you can do one where I didn't give you everything for a moment.  random sample that feels nice Independence  for UCSD students and you want to know what percentage use Snapchat?  I think people will honestly tell you if they use Snapchat.  It's a shame and using it as their pride in using it.  What's that look?  If there is no shame no.  Okay, good. No shame get rid of shame in your life. Life is so much better when you don't have a shame anymore. This is social construct and to get rid of it. It's not allow yourself to feel shame about anyting.  If I'm so much happiness, anyhow.  If I tell you that the spread out notice of P hat which tells you how peahat could vary.  From one sample to the next is this weird expression P hat and Q hat over in.  Let's see if you can build me a 95% confidence interval.  For the proportion of all UCSD students that use Snapchat. You've never got a problem like this. We'll see if you can just poured over the architecture to a new setting.  What do all these weird letters me? What is p hat? Well as a hat on it is pee on it. So it's something about sample.  So you should be figuring out the proportion of people that said yes in the sample. So you take 22/40. That's our best guess of what percentage of all UCSD students at 55% but feel right to you.  I mean, I just do a sample Mass some people. So hopefully they told me the truth.  I don't know depends if they feel shame or Pride around it.  Okay. So anyhow that will play the role of P hat you could have been 55% if you wanted and use the numbers 55 and 45 instead of .55 and .45. Okay. I'm just going to work in decimals because fewer people probably did that and I wanted to show you. Okay. Now there's this formula that tells you how he had will vary from one sample to the next based on our particular peahat. We see this kind of variability so we could see things up about 8% down about 8% even maybe 16% as a kind of variability. We didn't ask that many people only 40 so there can be a lot of variability in a sample of size 40 how many of the number 1 .96 memorized and related in relation to  Finding Z Star if you didn't do you have to go do an area calculation like this? So hopefully you got a confidence interval here that had 55 at its Center and it went up about two standard deviations each way.  Okay, so the true number somewhere between 39.6 and 70.4 we hope.  this interval came from a process that makes intervals that most of the time capture p  This interval could be a good one. It could be a bad one. I'll never know.  But it's a pretty big interval.  It seems pretty believable that the true percentage of somewhere in there. But again, it's a huge interval. So is it really that useful to us somewhere between 40 and 70% of you do something?  If you want to write me a sentence, here's what it looks like.  We are 95% confident that.  The true thing you're trying to measure percentage of Snapchat users among all UCSD students feels like a parameter P cuz it is is in our particular interval doesn't mean it isn't or interval.  It means the interval came from a process. That's a pretty good process in life.  Okay. So what you want to do over the next few weeks is realize every time we try to study of population. There's something you're studying in it. That's the parameter.  It will have some notation.  We will always write a small sample calculate the same idea down there. That's how the statistic it will have some notation memorize with these notations are so we've already seen you and getting mapped over to X bar and P hat.  And if you pay attention to this notation, it will always remind you where you are. Are you currently trying to talk about the population?  Are you currently talking about the sample are using the sample to lift back up to the population etcetera. So notation can really help you.  Okay. Now let's look at hypothesis testing and see how that might change carriers me with Dexter again.  So  What percent so let's go through this UCSD stress example, but let's think about not this particular problem, but what would change?  Okay. So the first thing you always do in these hypothesis test as you define some parameter, so in the old problem you would use because you're measuring an average stress level.  And our population was a big group 35,000 UCSD students or could be all UCSD students ever in the past or maybe in the past and future then it's even starting to feel infinite.  Okay. So what would change in this step right here if we were studying some other parameter?  Does anything change?  Go ahead.  Okay good. So the letter will change that's the first thing and the words will change but there was still be a population going on.  Okay. So those are the elements here.  Now it can get really complicated. It may not be a proportion. That's a nice gentle thing. Eventually will study the difference in two means  Oh my goodness. There's a parameter idea.  Hey what happened? Next? We made hypotheses. Here's what they look like in the stress example.  What changes here?  If we're in a different setting different kinds of parameters.  Go ahead.  How close just tastes a little dirty?  You're too happy. Don't be so happy in life.  Why should there not the hats?  Why should there not be hats?  Right. It's not the sample these claims these hypotheses about population parameters. So should have peas if it's about proportions. Very nice. See you fix your own thing. Okay, so whatever parameter appears in one will show up here in Step 2.  Is it time to go? No, I miss you already. Have a good day. "
