    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  Hope you had a nice weekend.  Hope you got any games.  I missed an game and Game of Thrones. So I'm not doing well in the games.  Okay. Today is a big nose bad in like that. Okay.  Facebook de Teresa hard conceptual day, so if you're good at procedures in life.  Today will be your undoing if a great conceptual things you love today. So let's figure out what you are. So it's time for us to look Beyond.  Are sample everything we've done so far you can describe this descriptive statistics. You describe a dataset but they're really two main branches of stat descriptive stats and inferential statistics where you draw inferences beyond your data set. So what we going to do first to set up a big ol honkin population, so this is everything you want to study in life. It might have infinitely many things in it.  It might have a huge finite number like a billion or you have no hope of talking to everyone.  So in this population, there should be something you care about some value that summarizes it. So if you could take the average weight of all human beings that would be an example of a parameter and P parameter goes with P population.  Okay. Now the trouble is you rarely can actually study an entire population because it's too big and somebody finna try to study of people died as you're trying to study them and new people are born so it's ever-changing.  So what you do is you draw your nice sample, right? And we talked about different ways to do this ways to make it representative and have his little biased as possible. And in your sample, you're going to calculate the same idea that you care about up in the cloud here. That is you'll find your statistic. SNS is how I remember this.  and the samples retractable object because it has a small enough number of people, but the problem is  What you'd like to do in life is take the result you get down here the statistic and figure out a way to lift it back up.  To say something about the population parameter.  Now there's a lot of ways to do this and we'll go through a couple of these.  People often use the term Point estimate to refer to the value you found in your sample for the statistic.  So when they go interview a bunch of people and they say should Donald Trump be impeached. They probably ask about a thousand people there probably get a percentage in that which it was. I don't know 38% on Sunday when I heard it.  But that is clearly not represented didn't ask everybody in the US.  So the question is how do you take that 38% that was just for a thousand people and responsibly report it.  As a fact about all people.  Now if you listen all the morning shows, none of them do this responsibly or have any kind of thought about how to do this because they don't really know anything. So we're going to learn how to do this today. So the first thing after realize is when you calculate a statistic and get you a little Point estimate, it's still just an estimate. It is not going to be exactly equal to the population parameter because there was a lot of loss of information as you went from 350 million Americans down to 1000.  and when you went from 1000 down to a single number 38%  Okay. So another way thing about this is when you draw sample, it's just a thousand random people and there can be a lot of variability when you talk to a thousand random people. If a if a heavy proportion of those came from some democratic State, then you get a higher impeachment percentage NFL larger portion came from the Republican state so you can see a lot of different numbers and you know, that is from polling cuz you've seen variability in polling data in recent elections. That's just reflecting the fact that there's random to send samples another feature that's important is how many people went into the sample. Obviously you don't ask to people  How they feel about the impeachment of trump because something feels limited. You've got through 350 million to 2 probably not a representative sample. Okay, so somehow the sample size will be encoded into all of this and how good the estimate is.  That one of the cool things is the following. You can see here as you collect more and more data.  Your sample gets bigger and bigger and in a limiting sent its filling out or becoming the population.  So if you could just ask everyone that would be the ideal.  Okay, so here's an example that sort of shows as you collect more data.  And then every sample you say, okay, let's measure something. That's a statistic. You can see that it asymptotic Lee approaches the True Value, which is one reason why I'd better sizes for samples white larger sizes for samples are better. That's why you want to collect things. But unfortunately you have reality slapping you in the face in bigger-is-better. Well unfortunately bigger is also worse.  It cost money to talk to human being and try to get their truce.  And it you have to work very hard to get bigger and bigger samples because you have to dig deeper into the remote parts of society. You want to go to Alaska? Don't talk to everybody. Good luck getting everyone in Alaska hard to get anywhere in Alaska just to talk to five or six people. Okay, so let's start exploring this and think about this.  How bad will my estimate be?  So this is an emotional question. I'm going to ask you emotional things.  Okay, depends on a lot of variables. So here's the setup will take something, you know, nothing about in case you don't have any like preconceived things were going to go to an alien planet, you know, nothing about it.  We're going to try to find the average weight of this new alien species to truly do this. We would have to talk to every single alien on the planet and then just take an average but we have finite time. So we're not going to do this. Okay. So which of these two setups makes you feel better when you draw sample?  Then calculate your point estimate that is the average in your sample will start with the easiest case. You want to talk about this.  Go ahead.  Why 300?  The larger the sample the closer it gets to being an accurate representation of the population. Why?  Why?  Why conceptually?  Wow, very nice. So you said that's a sample gets larger. It doesn't have a good chance of being skewed anymore. And if you want to figure out what a hundred people believe in you.  You know, the only thing that could have happened is the one person who didn't talk to her some crazy person and didn't get included in the sample. But that's very rare yasso add to sample filled out to the population the randomness component minimizes and so the variability of things goes down. So I like 300 also. Okay, let's say you look in your sample. Okay, forget that 3 to 30 vs. 300. Okay, you have two samples of the same size now so that variables held constant, but when you look at your data in the first sample all the way to around two hundred and the second one the weights vary wildly.  When you find the average in each, which one do you believe more cost more feel good about?  Okay, soda logic was you love the wild variation because the super high people counteract the super low people.  Okay. Does anyone want to argue the opposite Viewpoint? Go ahead?  Okay. So you said if everything is near 200 and it's not very wildly.  And you feel quite emotionally stable about what's going on.  I think about that logic.  Okay, let's try this way. I've got these two people. They want to be your friend one is very emotionally stable everyday.  They range from like a 7 to an 8 on their happiness.  The other person goes from 0 to 10 and you never have any idea what you're going to get every day.  What you going to choose if your goal in life is to have someone who is predictable?  Yeah, so it's interesting. It's very easy to be tempted into the wild variation is the first answer because of some cancellation thing, but you just canceling wild things you have to remember if they're on their 200 you still get cancellation. It's just a little above cancels a little below.  So you should feel better about the consistent emotional experience if your goal is to say what is happening on average.  So maybe you do this with your when you pick those fantasy football leagues, do you pick the players that have incredible variation in their ability and will have a 10-day followed by today?  Or do you pick people that are consistent?  That's for you to think about. Okay. Now, let's see if the light is everything else. Okay, so same sample sizes and now it happens is  Would you rather the alien population be normally distributed on some interval or would you rather be uniformly distributed?  see if these two different worlds you could be choosing from you'll choose a sample from both you find the average and which average do feel better about  Go ahead.  Okay.  Very nice as you sat her over the last 5 minutes. How do you feel about your willingness to participate we like? Oh gosh. I hate all these conceptual things. Let's just talk about numbers. Give me formulas or you like I love this. Let me talk right now. I'm good at this kind of stuff. This will show you what kind of person you are good. So normal the normal distribution tries to things near and it says that's where your population sort of lives so we can practice them all and makes it very rare to see outliers wears a uniform distribution. You're just as likely to get a very low weight person is high Tony draw sample, you get lots of variability.  Which is bad for believing in your data's your statistic. You're going to get now. Let me show you a pretty little picture about what's going to happen.  So we're going to look at a piece of software called XP exploratory software for confidence intervals, its downloadable on the Internet. It's a fancy Excel spreadsheet created by Professor who is in Australia named Jeff Cummings.  So here's what we're going to do up here is our population bees are aliens.  Okay, if you want to see them I can fill them in there. They are look at them all.  Okay, I'll take them away now in life. You normally don't see this. It's hidden from you.  But I'm going to let you see it for a while, but imagine it's not there. Okay?  Now, let's say you wanted to find the average weight. Well, if you can see the blue curve that means you know, everybody in the planet and the average is this line right here at Shifty this normal curve is Center 250. So the whole goal is to find that that's the population parameter.  Okay. Now we can't see the blue curve and we can't see the vertical line. So what are you do you say I'm going to go drop sample, so you can select a sample size right here will just take 20 aliens. So let me go take a sample. Okay, so there are the 20 aliens and blue and these are their weight. They just would have fell down from the weed distribution graph.  And what do you do with those 20 numbers you average them together and you get the meat that's for sample statistic. So you only ever see these 20 weights in the green. That you calculated.  About the green. Obviously is not right on the vertical line. Oh, sorry, they don't always give you exactly the truth. But you already knew that.  How do we decide if that green. Is any good or not? This is the tricky moment.  In order to decide if something is good or worthwhile or interesting or close to the value. The only way you can do that is to completely understand what could have happened.  Example, how do you decide if someone is attractive to you?  Well, you would have to understand the landscape of what could happen for human beings, right and you look around everyday and you look at people.  And there's some percentage of people that you like. Oh, that's it for me and they made some threshold B. How do you decide if someone is really tall?  You would have to know the distribution of height for all human beings and they will have to be on some upper.  Percentile of that may be in the top 5% of the top 1% So in every case, you need to understand the distribution of what could happen and here is not the distribution of the blue.  I want to understand the distribution of the green that will tell us if our green. As any good or not?  So how might one do this? Well, you could imagine repeating this.  draw lots of samples and for every sample calculate the green.  And as you do this you're getting a picture of what could have happened and that will then give you a sense. If your data are a good representation of things are not now as you cut more and more you could imagine them piling up.  So let me turn on the Min Heap.  Okay. So this is a big pile of all the different means we got from our samples and we're about to create is called a sampling distribution. It is a beautiful picture distribution of what could happen across all the samples that you could ever draw.  Now this will draw a finite number and then we'll just sort of imagine it going on forever and creating infinitely many.  Okay, so they're piling up here and it's effectively making a histogram. And if you do it infinitely many times you would just get a histogram and get some nice smooth representation some Distribution on top of it.  So this is what's possible when you go take 20 aliens from some blue curved. You can't see add gym together to get one green. And repeat the process infinitely.  Do you have a feeling of what this green heap of dots is going to look like?  Just say no.  Do you need me to draw smooth representation of it?  Would that help?  One thing you'll notice is that most of the green dots are near the black line. That's good that says statistics works as a field. Okay. If All The Raindrops Were really far from the truth the population parameter assist vertical line, that would be bad. You also noticed. It's very hard to get something really far away from the truth.  If you look up at the blue curve, it's not hard to get individual aliens that are really far away.  But when it comes to averaging together a group it's very hard for that to be far away from the truth.  And the reason is because of your idea from earlier about canceling if you go take 20 people. Yeah, you're going to get some extremes but don't cancel each other out and hens pull the average tour the truth.  I'll be better built up enough.  Are you starting to feel what it should be?  So if I quit this little thing here sampling distribution curve, it will draw the truth on top.  So we made a big Discovery here while you only collect one sample in life. And you only take one average and you only get one green. Your green daughter Your Average.  Is a point estimate that comes from this green Universe right here and talk there's another clever way to think in life. You always think mystery population in the cloud draw sample find the average get a green.  The other way to think is there's a green distribution here.  I can't see it.  Why don't I just draw Green. From it and that's the same thing as drawing 20 blue dots and averaging them.  So this is our sampling distribution.  Embedded in this is the fact that we took averages. Okay, that's not you can take other things. You can take the median of the data set or something like that.  So what's cool about Esky is it let you explore questions like this in a very stimulating visual way so note again that the population of the top is were trying to study. It has some feature that you care about perhaps it's me, but it's invisible. Okay, so you draw sample and blue and you calculated stat  That's one green. You can imagine repeating this over and over and as you do this it creates the sampling distribution.  You have to do it infinitely many times to get the perfect representation of what's going on.  Now you want to know what curve this green thing really is.  I'm guessing you can probably figure out a few things. Let me help you with some notation and we're going to be using this the whole course. So this is really valuable notation to put on things. First of all up here in the cloud the population it centered somewhere and I'm going to give it the letter M you we are going to use Greek letters.  When we are referring to the population.  This how you know that something is about everybody that you want to study. This has a spread out this. Okay, I'm using Sigma.  Okay, so it says individual way to vary.  What can you do? If your dry your sample in your sample you calculate the statistic will use Latin letters to show that we are down in the sample so xbar it's a nice notation.  And you could use S Sub X for the spread out in the size of the sample.  the samples standard deviation  so that horrible formula with a square root in the end minus one that you love so much that formula is about these blue dots here and it's funny. How spread out there are.  Now if you imagine repeating the process and trying to study how xbar looks and feels across different samples you created the sampling distribution, which is the green thing at the bottom.  And all we need to do is figure out what shape that curve is where it's centered and how spread out it is and that will completely explain what could happen with an average when we taking in a sample and this will allow us to decide if our averages weird or not or what could happen with an average when we take one.  So here's our Discovery first thing.  Most of you will probably believe that this green curve is centered at Mew.  I took a lot of time talking about that. So you could feel these emotional things when you got bored of me repeating stuff in your mind or start wandering and exploring. Look at Falls right under Mew, doesn't it?  Okay. So statistics isn't broken a useful tool to figure out population parameters is what we discovered. That's the easiest thing to see you should know how spread out this is.  now this starts getting confusing because  The spread out in this if you look back on the previous, there's all kinds of spread out if there's a standard deviation of the blue universe.  There's a standard deviation in your sample and there's a standard deviation down here of the green universe.  That's some of those might be the same as some might be different.  You'll notice up here that it looks like I do these red arrows so that they're roughly the same and that's the case if you draw a sample it supposed to be representative of the population. So it's spread out. This should be representative, roughly.  If you look down here though at the dash green lines, they're not as wide as the dash blue lines.  So there's a different standard deviation down here in the green Universe. We use the phrase standard error.  Whenever you want to talk about the standard deviation.  of the sampling distribution  It was just a new term to delineate that there are a lot of standard deviations going on it. So chooses a different word standard are now how big is it? It turns out to be Sigma / \u221a end. So that uses the spread out Miss of the original population and it uses the sample size, which was 24 Us in that simulation.  Now that's not easy to prove.  You have to do a little work. Sometimes I have people do it on the homework. You have all the skills.  The last thing you need to know is what shape is curved is and it turns out this is a normal distribution. If you start with a normal distribution up in the sky the blue curve.  And we'll eventually a road that assumption in the sky. So usually the same thing distribution is normal.  impress right now definitely is so what this means is this green curve is just a normal distribution center that Mew with standard deviation Sigma over the square root of n  And what they say is this is the distribution of xbar.  The distribution of X was the blue curve up in the sky which was a normal distribution center that Miu was spread out in a sigma.  And basically what it says is if you want to take an average.  First of all, all the possible averages will come from a normal distribution. The average is desperately want to be near the True Value.  And they will not be spread out as the original population was.  This is one reason why we averaged stuff together in life cuz it tamps down the variability of what's going on.  This is why when they look at my tenure case to decide if they should keep me or not. They don't look at a particular students opinions. They look at the average which gives a sense of what's really going on rather than the vicissitudes of people that love or hate me.  Okay.  Now we have this cool thing right this new tool the sampling distribution.  So earlier we were talking about sample sizes in the question is is a bigger size Better or Worse. Does it make you feel better about the average you're going to get in? So here's a picture on the left Iran SP with taking only 10 aliens that sees 10 blue dots.  And over here, we used 40 and I repeated this and you can see the two different sampling distributions. That's basically what could happen with X bar.  And look how variable the average can be down here on the left. It is a lot of variability. Where's over here? The curve is getting tighter when use 40 people to decide what's going on the results of very less.  On average, they both give the correct value, but it's about the variability around that and so one thing you'll notice if you calculate the standard error.  That is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.  Over here you get stigma over Route 10 and sigma's how spread out the blue universe is an over here you get signal over Route 40, but you can see is going to have half the variability of the picture on the left.  This is one reason that bigger is better attempts down the variability. You'll get in the average to get a very consistent experience for the average.  Okay, so where we wiring people's emotions, some people really love great variability cuz of things canceling out.  Yeah, one thing you'll notice when you only have 10 people look at this. Look at this sample that had 10 people with to kwesi high outliers and look what they did to the green. They pulled it way up.  When we have 40 there were still two huge ones up here just by random chance, but look there were plenty of low ones over there to balance them out.  And there's the bouncing effect you get that comes with lots of data.  Okay. So here we are with the summary. Here's what we've done so far.  We start with a population too big to measure everybody. We use Greek letters to describe it. Where is it? Standard how spread out it is and usually the question of where is Center the most important thing in your life as a statistician. That's what you care about most often.  Okay. Now we drew a nice blue normal distribution, but we're going to later see it doesn't matter what the distribution looks like. And that's the power statistics. It'll work even if we are road that assumption. Okay, then we decided we're going to draw sample. When you do this to pick a sample size that the pain that feels like a Latin letter and you need to build a nice simple. Not a garbage sample.  So usually take independent observations if you want to know the average weight.  Okay, don't walk into a baby Ward where everyone weighs 7 lb that's not independent. Okay, they'll depend on each other while baby is right just pick random people from the US. Okay, and we talk to you later. Statistic X barlata notation and we recognize that's a point estimate for what we care about.  Now the thing is that point estimate is a green. That came from this universe that's normally centered at Mew and has a spread out in the sixth Sigma over Rutan.  So, there we go.  Now once I straighten saying is it's very hard to choose independent things.  How do you know if people really are independent from each other?  So what we're going to do in this class and what people do in real life is instead of Independence when we want to build a sample.  We're going to use these conditions right here, which are randomly choose people.  And as long as you don't choose too many people.  So this is condition less than 10% of the population size.  If you choose random people and don't use too many then you tend to get independence or effectively Independence there and talk about more more about this later. It is just the initial emotional appeal that Independence is a complicated thing.  Now why do you care about the sampling distribution is the next question go ahead.  So the question is when you re sample and draw a new sample, is it bad idea to be able to reuse people? It turns out it's totally fine to reuse people. There's no problem with that at all. You're doing things infinitely many times and it turns out asking topically not to matter whether you  The problem is you don't if you take your first sample, and then you let go kill them all so that they can't be resampled. Okay what happens if you just destroy the population so you really need like a theoretical construct that you could keep drawing from infinitely so you can't omit people is another way to think about it.  but in the asymptotic limits for these things that basically doesn't really matter what you do if you start with a population of infinity and you start killing people off it's fine also,  If there's infinitely many people population, you can't use this thing called the sampling distribution. It's really tough.  So what were you doing still something called a confidence interval? If you took AP Stat you seen this before but you probably didn't really get the idea then because it really is quite complicated.  Okay. So what we're going to do is Rent-A-Car Point estimate that is rx bar from one sample.  Look up pad that answer and this is how we're going to responsibly report out. What we think is going on with me with a population parameter. So we'll take Jack's Bar and we'll build an interval that symmetric so we'll do the same amount each way. Okay and Central to it will be our best guess from you.  Hey right now my best guess of what's going on with President Trump and what percentage of people in America want to impeach him 38% cuz I saw that number on Sunday night, so that would be the center of my interval.  The only question that remains then is how much you want to pad your answer by.  And this is where it gets confusing and frustrating. So, let me give you some metaphors here.  So the first one is the criminal at the art gallery. So you have this art gallery and a criminal is broken in and stolen tomorrow. And they've escaped and you're the head of the police and you have to decide what to do. So your best guess of the criminal is the art gallery cuz that's the last known location, right? That's X bar. But obviously you're not just going to go to the art gallery cuz they're not going to stay there and they're probably not there anymore. Right? So you want to build a search radius.  around the museum  Now when you decide how big the search radius is your effectively deciding How likely you are to capture this person.  Now you can build a search radius of 5 feet.  The pro of that is if the criminal happens to be in your tiny little search radius. It's not hard to find them. You've narrowed it down very closely. You can build a search radius of 500 miles.  Okay, the con is huge zone, right?  The pro is there probably in the search radius.  So it's this constant trade-off of How likely are they to be in there?  And how big is the thing is another example, I don't know the average weight of people in 183.  Okay, let me just guessing number 160 now. I'm going to pad that.  So if I pad it by like three pounds each way and the true mean is actually in there. That's great. Cuz I have a very good idea of how much you weigh on average, but there's not a very good chance.  You probably don't believe that 157 to 163 get it do you?  Okay, how about I take 160 and iPad it by a hundred pounds each way.  The average weight of people in 183 is somewhere between 60 and 260. Do you think I got it?  You do know there's a high probability, right? But here's the problem. It's a worthless Interpol. It's too big.  Okay, great.  Okay, the impeachment percentage of trump it somewhere between zero and 100%  but it's a worthless interval doesn't help you do anything when you go fishing. Okay, you see if it's right. It's right there. You should be if you throw a small net.  Maybe it doesn't catch the fish.  But if it does you have a nice area where you know, the fishes you can throw a huge knot the size of the lake or catch the fish, but then where's the fish in it? I don't know. So this is the problem with pattern.  The bigger you make the intervals the more like you are to capture it.  but unfortunately  You don't have as good of an idea of where it is.  So let me show you this here. So let's clear all this nonsense out. So now we're going to put confidence intervals down. So let's take a sample.  Oh my goodness.  It's a softer feel kind of garbage into you.  It's not shiny like the things you love, right?  Okay, so let's take a sample.  So there we go. See see the green. And you see me patting it by some amount right now. Did it pass through the trueresult I'll have to look for is whether this vertical line is inside the green in it, and it did and it was good. Okay now  Let me draw another one if we got lucky again right now, you can imagine that this process would not capture the True Value. So right down here is a very cold steel versus the confidence level. Okay, if it's really high you want to make sure the interval turns green and captures new but I can change it to a different number like 40. I don't really need to be that sure on what's going on. I know that's all you have to do is make the interval less wide and suddenly some of them start missing.  Okay, so if the number is 40% and you said that is your confidence level?  What it means if you want 40% of the intervals that could be created to turn green into have new in them.  And if you set the confidence of a very high you want to be very sure about your intervals but notice that the software does in order to achieve that as you increase the confidence level.  It requires the intervals to grow wider just like the search radius did for the criminal.  Okay, so stop this and I'll change this 42 say 75. We want a good chance of capturing the criminal look all the search radius is got wider. You want a 99% chance. They may be that person stole the Mona Lisa and you have to get them. They look how wide the intervals become.  Not in reality. You are one green.  And you were deciding how big is interval should be so what we need to do is come up with the formula. Now that helps us decide how much to pad by and it was somehow use this idea of confidence level in there.  So let's go back to the sampling distribution.  I love this class cousin with no formulas.  The push is conceptual things. So here we got look at this.  This is a sampling distribution. It's all the X bars. We could have gotten.  And if you just think about it, it's a normal distribution for a second 95% of any normal distribution is two standard deviations from the mean hear. The standard deviation is called the standard error just to remind us when the sampling distribution.  Okay, so 95% of all green dots are pretty close to Mew.  Okay. So anytime you generate X bars. There's a pretty good chance. They'll be close to me you and the distance of how close they are is just two standard deviations.  Okay. Now here's a clever way to think about this.  So I started by thinking about it at the top of the slide stand at the center of the green curve reach out to standard deviations in your grab most of those green.  So if my make my arms this wide.  I grabbed most of the green dots the other way to think about it is to keep your arms at with and to imagine standing at a green.  Or different green.  So most of the time if you stand at a green. And you have your arms that wide two standard deviations, you'll grab Mew.  There's another way of thinking about it say 95% of this class is probably a hundred feet away from me. Sorry people way back there. You don't make the cut right? But most of you are within a hundred thirty feet of me about it from your perspective if you reached at 130 feed you grab me, right?  Sorry people the back you get lost there, too.  So you can either think about this issue of grabbing dots from you and reaching out or from every single green. And reaching out and since we're green. And we're trying to grab me we should adopt that philosophy in life are so there's the equivalence that's helpful to think about.  Okay, so this tells us actually how far we should reach.  We imagine standing in a Green Dot and reaching out to standard deviations. And this will give us a certain capture percentage.  Okay, here's the picture again.  If you imagine all these confidence intervals falling down to the bottom.  You get a picture of the sampling distribution. But in addition you would have all the green dots reaching out and desperately trying to grab Mew.  And here's the cool thing is the 95% of these things are going to be green.  If they all reach out to standard deviations because of what we saw on the previous slide about what happens if you stand up Mew and reach out to standard deviations or to send adair's feel like that station. Language better little problem here. It's much easier once I start breaking up formulas for some people. So there's all the conceptual stuff.  So we're back on our planet. We drop sample 50 aliens seems like a lot. I guess. I don't know.  In the sample you get a statistic.  The average in your sample when you describe it using descriptive statistics is 130 and they're spread out and it's in your sample of 3.8.  So first thing we want to think about notation.  Where are we in the picture? And this is a really important thing notation can help remind you of where you live and tell other people where you live.  Okay. So this average was about the 50 blue dots and it was the X bar which is a single green. So put X bar is 130.  I were talking about how spread out.  Our sample is are used as subjects feels like Latin letters, right? If you put a Greek letter there we're done with the problem. The whole point is to help think about the Greek letter mu the average weight of all alien.  Okay, I'm going to help you do the step.  Instead of having you do it our best guess is 1:30 from you. But obviously we just have a point estimate. So what we're going to do is change that to a confidence interval and say you know what when I hand you something I'm going to hand you a Zone where I think from you live. I'm not going to hand you my one result. Okay on the news when they told me Trump impeachment thing. I need Italy thought that's a point estimate. There's some bigger span. That's the truth of our society right now.  Now that's not how most people think when they hear things. They're like, oh, I guess that means 38% of Americans believe Trump should be impeached that's not true at all 38% of the sample believes that if you can even trust sample day. What you can't  Okay. So how do we report a 95% confidence interval? So the 95% refers to How likely you want the interval to capture, Mew?  Do you really want to get the criminal in the search radius or not? So here's what you do you stand at your green. And you reach out to standard deviations. This is what we decided gets 95% of things in life, right? I do standing arm you and getting 95% of. Sue standing all the dots the number two.  How do you feel about that?  The reason I can put the number to there is because the number two is only an approximation.  Of how you get 95% of the area two standard deviations that we saw last class was only an approximation. So we'll figure out how to get this number later. Now how many standard deviations to and how big are the standard deviation Sigma over this word event?  this is what we saw about the green curve right send back to using that that  Okay, we're going to change this in a moment. And most of the work in these problems is figuring out how to get this number.  And the rest is just plugging things into a formula now one thing I noticed about this formula is it uses Sigma?  How do I ever know Sigma Sigma is how spread out the blue universe is?  The only way you know how spread out that is is by asking every alien ever.  How much they weigh and plugging them all into a standard deviation formula.  As long as you're asking every alien how much they weigh and plugging it into the standard deviation formula. Why don't you just take the mean?  Okay, so you're never going to know this thing? This is a hopeless formulas unusable.  So we should just give up and go home, right?  I think we can cancel the class to tistics is broken. It's unusable.  What's a good approximation for Sigma?  Latin s  SMX the spread on the population should look like the spread out in this of the sample. If we did a good job drawing the sample. Hey, there we go. So why don't we approximate?  Sigma with sfx and this is what you end up having to do. So a lot of the time in statistics you're going to find things that you are sort of theoretically constructed and you don't know them and what you have to do is just use day that you actually have so we're going to use sfx instead now.  Could that have been a mistake? Could that have been dangerous?  Dancers, yes, that was dirty, but will fix it later in chapter 5 so we'll all be dirty for a while. Okay.  Don't be afraid it's fine. I'm going to Camping the goal is to get dirty and then you fix it when you get home and you take a shower. So we'll take a shower in chapter 5. So anyhow, I put 3.8 here cuz that's what was going on with 50 people understand Polly Pocket all in and you get an interval.  Not at the center of the interval is your point estimate your best guess you guys are our best guess with 130. It looks like it's in the center of that. Right? But he reported back an interval is Joan and we say, you know, what? I don't think Mew is 130. I'm not that naive but here's this interval that has a very good chance of having you in it.  now doesn't have to  as I generate intervals of this kind 95% of them will have new in them because we use that 95% help build a with idea, but we might have a garbage e interval.  Now the last thing that I do report this this is where it starts getting really dirty and there's a lot of misconceptions the following phrase and it's a very particular were 95% confident.  That doesn't say there's a 95% probability. It doesn't say there's a 95% chance.  Okay, we're 95% confident. That is a very specific phraseology.  And what are we confident about that the true mean which is known as him you will live in our particular interval.  And there's no probability statements here probability only makes sense when you have some random thing going on in life.  So if I have a person behind a curtain?  And you can't see them they're random to you. So you don't know their self identify gender so you could say there's a 51% chance they self identify as female.  But if I'm standing here in front of you there's not a 50 or 49% chance. I'm male. Okay, like I've already decided on my identification. I'm not a random thing. Okay. This interval is not a random thing. It's already constructed created it sits there.  Okay a coin yet to be flipped has Randomness it could turn up heads 50% of the time but I can flip it and it's sitting there in front of you.  You don't say there's a 50% chance that it's heads you look at it, and you tell me if it's heads or not.  Okay, so me will either be in here or not. So the confidence phrase here. What is referring to is the process we had a process that build confidence intervals the process look like this take Akbar?  Going to go crazy. I want my minute. You can't have my minute.  Is the process?  We will collect a sample after we do so we will find X bar after that. We will Pat it.  Then we'll have a confidence interval I get to do any of that.  Thermal processes design to build intervals so that most of them capture the true thing 95% of them. So I'll random confidence interval that has yet to be created as a 95% chance of having you in it but our sitting in front of us not a random event.  So we're confident about the process.  So we're going to do a lot more on this is your first day. Thanks for working hard today. I'll see you Wednesday. "
