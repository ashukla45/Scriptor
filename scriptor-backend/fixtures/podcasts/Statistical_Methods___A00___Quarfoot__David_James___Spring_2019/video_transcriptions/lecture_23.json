    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  Okay time for the big rift today. We jump across the Divide. We are leaving means behind us and we can start talking about proportions. So everything, you know about means doesn't apply in this setting.  But all the infrastructure that we learned can carry over in part. So here we are going to do one population today or you care about proportions now.  And then we'll go pick up paired.  Sorry non paired.  What is independent populations next class?  Okay. So here's the cool thing. Our infrastructure is largely going to carry over.  And the reason is because of the following may be able to think about before she moves like this, but they really are averages of A Sort and guy. So anytime you want to figure out of proportion. All you do is take the number of people that have the thing you care about and you divided by the total number. So usually you're just thinking about the ratio of two numbers doesn't feel like an average at all to me. But if however you think about everyone that has your feature is one and everyone that doesn't is a zero, then you really added up a bunch of ones and zeros and taking their average.  So in a sense, it feels like an average even though that's maybe never how you interpreted it before.  Okay. So this one reason why the infrastructure will carry over in part.  Okay, next thing we need notation or we're all going to use integreon in life. When it came to means we use things like Sigma or sorry, Mew and X bar to distinguish whether we were in a population or sample.  And I kept talking about Greek letters signifying or in a population and Latin letters being in your in a sample. Unfortunately that metaphor falls apart here because history ruin things for sure. If you're talking about the population proportion if you could talk to everyone ever and ask them if they identify a certain way or not.  Then you could just calculate the total number to say yes over the total population size which would be huge and you would have found pee, but if you can only talk to a small set of people.  This will be called P hat. This is the same idea in your sample and everyone in the world uses this notation to help keep track of where you are.  Now person went to figure out is what is the sampling distribution look like that is if you decide you're going to go out and ask some people how they identify and in your sample. You're going to figure out P hat. How could that vary?  from one sample to the next  McCarthy hot. It turns out it's going to be a random variable. So let's do this little setup here suppose you want to know the percentage of people in San Diego that self identify as LGBT  Okay. Well option one. Talk to everyone in San Diego.  Impossible people move in and out every day thousands of people. So it's a hopeless Pursuit now, I'll tell you what the answer is if there is such a thing as a b c answer.  Just so we have this 3.9% This is based on the largest study that happened in 2016. They so it's my best. Guess we'll just assume it's the truth, but we don't know that the whole point is to figure out the 3.9%  Okay, so what do you do usually in life? You just dropped one sample?  And here we're going to take 500 random people and in your one sample you figure out what's going on. So there's your P hat.  No is normally where it ends right but in order to understand the sampling distribution, what could happen is you change up samples? You have to imagine this process happening many times. So let's have it happened many times. Okay, here we go spit out another value for p hat in a slightly different sample.  Giant simple 3 maybe there's a ton of people from Hillcrest that randomly got into your sample. And now you're LGBT percentage is much higher than it was in the other samples to see the variability. Right? So the sampling distribution is nothing more than a picture or histogram of all these different P hatch you should get  Now I ran the study in the computer and there's a picture of all my different P hats. I did it a thousand times usually drop one sample, but you can't see the picture of the sampling distribution if that's all you do in life.  So here's a picture of how P hat varies.  So there's a couple things we want to know about the sampling distribution.  Where is the centered how spread out is it?  What shape is this beautiful curve here?  Oh my goodness, so you're probably going to not be flabbergasted to learn that the sampling distribution is normal in this time. When I tell you it's normal. I'm not taking that back later and changing it to tea.  I forgot you can put that in your store now. So anytime you want to use a normal distribution. The problem should be about proportions.  Next thing. Where is it standard? Well, it's centered on the true LGBT percentage up in the cloud 3.9. So if you go out to a bunch of people the universe doesn't want to lie to you it wanted to do a value near the truth. So that's why the highest point here is around three point nine.  Now it's not obvious. It's this last thing how spread out is this blue picture. So turns out it's a square root of P Witcher 3 .9 x q which is 1 - 400 - out of here thinking in percentages.  Divided by the square root of n where n is the sample size.  I was actually tough to prove. I require some binomial approximation normal approximation to a binomial that you learned later in life.  So is a fact you have to trust me on for now.  Okay. Sure. There's a blue Universe. There's a sampling distribution.  That's nice because from this we can do any kind of inferential things. We want we can book confidence intervals hypothesis tests and so on so we'll try this little thing first as 200 random UCSD students. Do you identify as one of the letters in the acronym?  An 8. So yep, that's me.  They already this is a garbage approach. You can't ask people straight out.  Sensitive questions about their identity. You'll never get the truth.  But anyhow, we were we were in a garbage study find a 90% confidence interval for the true proportion of all UCSD students if I could talk to everybody on campus.  and I could figure out p  So, how do we do something like this? Well, the cool thing is we already have the infrastructure. So first thing figure out your best guess  This is what's going on in your sample are samples about 4% LGBT.  sing high sing low  What's your experience like with this school?  Does anyone have any experience with the lgbtq Inus?  of UCSD  No, it's hopeless.  Okay, so I don't know 4% There's some number.  Now you're one of the people that's obsessed with this LGBT percentage is a very complicated thing to measure and if you look across different countries over the last 20 years were people done studies you get things as low as half a percent up to 10%  So there's a lot of variability. So when you hear people quoting numbers about this LGBT percentage  You should be very careful believing any of these particular numbers has changed so much.  Mexican break out a confidence interval formula the same right take your best guess anymore cuz we're not doing with me. It's called that was going on in your sample. Then you need to add and subtract some sort of star idea some critical value time some spread out and it's of some sampling distribution.  Now it's cool here is because the sampling distribution was normal we can put these are here again. We don't need T star with some degree of Freedom nonsense. So everything just got a lot easier actually.  Okay, so if you want to figure out a 90% confidence interval your back to this kind of picture where you swim 90% of the area in the center. There's some are you don't care about in the ends and your goals to figure out this place right here on the horizontal axis?  It sort of defines the boundary where the central 90% lives and you can use Q Norm to plow through are you don't care about an area you do care about to get to that place or you can have his number memorized because you do so many 90% confidence intervals. That's what I do. But of course on the exam  I'm going to give you a 90% confidence interval doesn't show me if you actually know anything just shows me if you written down the Z Star value for 90% on your cheat sheet. What's a real understanding? I know all the ways the student use to avoid actually learning things.  Call Seibert all of those approaches.  Ernie Howe. Okay, so here we out 1.647 now in this setting with proportions.  This standard error formula looks different and used to be something like Sigma / \u221a and standard deviation of the \u221a and that's cuz I was mean this formula requires p and Q.  Which is the very thing we're currently trying to build a confidence interval for.  All hope is lost go home.  Or how about we do what we usually do in these kinds of settings. Why don't we replace p&q with our best guesses and what's going on for them which here would be Q hat and he had a very standard thing to do that when we were dealing with normal distributions and means it was that step right there that cost a lot of trouble when we were play stigma with the standard deviation hair turns out it's not that bad to replace pee with P hat and you get to stay on a normal distribution. So I put for and I put 100 - 4 in 4 q noticed. I'm very pretty today girl this percent symbols.  Okay, you can do the whole problem in percents. If you want to hear you get this confidence interval.  And you see our best guess of what's going on if we could talk to all UCSD students ever.  Is that the LGBT percentage is somewhere in this big huge range?  And that it may not even be in that range. This could be one of those naughty confidence intervals that doesn't actually capture things 10% of the time we build them they're going to be naughty if we have 90% confidence interval.  Now some of you may not be proportion people or percentage people.  You might be decimal people and that's fine if your decimal person.  You can do the whole problem in decimals.  So suddenly you're 4% is not .04. Nothing changes about a sea star that's nothing to do with the unit system using  and over here p&q or not .04 + 1 - that not 100 - that  You have to make sure that the whole problem is in the same unit system. You can't use percentages out front like 4% in decimals inside the square root this blows everything away.  How you feel?  We build our first confidence interval.  Now that's an act of inference. You're moving beyond the observed data to a larger universe. You're making an inference.  So every time we do that through those pesky conditions.  So what are the pesky conditions here? If you really want the sampling distribution? I showed you earlier.  To really be that beautiful normal distribution. What has to be true?  So first of all with the same first condition Independence, you can't build a garbage sample and then hope that you can lift out from garbage and do something good in life. It just doesn't work. So we need to Independence. So getting your check randomization and you won't do too deep into your population.  Hey now, the second condition looks totally different than it did before this is called the 10 successes and failures condition.  So when you look in your sample.  And you see people that identify as LGBT which were the successes here. You've got to have at least 10 of them.  And you need to attend the people that didn't identify as LGBT.  The reason is if you're trying to study something.  And good A good measure on how often it appears it helps if it actually appears in your sample some.  Crazy, huh?  You also want it to not appear too much.  But if you want some failures to show up.  Are the other kind of reason if it's way way way too prevalent and 99 out of every hundred people you talked to identify this way. It's very hard to distinguish what's going on up at the upper end as well just as the same tissue in the lower end.  Interesting idea of your study has appeared enough times to be a fair estimate and hasn't appeared way too much.  Now if you look back at our previous study, for example, I randomly chose UCSD students I chose 200 of them. So you're probably feeling fine about independence Quizlet more than 2,000 people that go here.  Now if you look at how many successes and failures we had we only had eight successes.  So we're trying to measure something that wasn't showing up enough in our study to really get a good handle on a two-week shouldn't have built the confidence interval. We just built.  How's that feel?  Do you feel like you've violated the universe somehow?  Done something nasty dividing by zero and math is something. Okay. Let's do some Socrative and see how you're doing.  And then we get to do one of my favorite problems in the whole course.  I get so excited every time I see it.  recent Gallup poll 810 out of 1012 on computer duplicate  810 out of 1012 favored higher fuel efficiency standards  What is the parameter going on in the study?  Are you people that shows a a number is almost never a parameter? Cuz if a parameter equals a number means, you know something about the entire population and I don't know why you're using statistics to do anything that you've already completely got it KC versus Diaz just people not carefully noticing that we sampled.  U.s. Adults, so we probably shouldn't infer beyond that.  You left out all the children. They probably have views about fuel efficiency also.  we're going to build a 70% CI what calculation will happen along the way in our  Okay, let's see 70% in the middle these .15 on the left side. You need to plow through that to get to this spot right here see Star that's why .85 is showing up an answer is Pinot Noir finds areas underneath that's not what we want. We have the area underneath. That's why we're using to Norm to get the place on the horizontal axis.  Which fine is the 70% CI?  Interesting how it divides up the proportions on this?  When there's a select mini socrata doesn't really know how to like do this.  I'm guessing more than 57% show C but has to make the numbers add up there looking internally within each bin. I don't know why they can't get that, right?  see you can design better software than  the best on the market  are we allowed to do inference in this setup?  Oh my gosh, this is the first time ever. No one has chosen a  that is amazing. Thank you for not choosing a  it doesn't even apply here. Okay, so we have lots of successes and lots of failures. So have 10 of each at least 10 of each and we just need some Independence thing randomly selected adults.  And there's way more than 10 times this many adults. So we've done it.  So I don't think I was maybe I was 30 years old when I finally realized it percent.  We think about percent so silly.  We think the unit is percent.  Right, or maybe you think it's unitless or something, but it's really not.  Percent always measuring a division of two ideas. So in the numerators the ident people that identifies some idea which has been hidden when you just say percent.  Maybe it's a percent for some proposition or the percent against some proposition who knows and the denominator have some unit also, which is like human beings or some other idea that you're measuring. So that's what this problem is all about. So 78.7. So this percentage about us adults. That's what the denominator is for it and is the percent that supported the standards or not.  are supporting  look at all these other choices, there was so tempting. What does the percentage on the 70 refer to?  Okay. Well, I'm glad no one shows A and B, you know, those have to be wrong given what we just did right so that only leave C&D you should never use the phrase probability when talking about this particular interval and whether this particular interval captures some parameter or not this particular intervals, not a random process.  If you build lots of confidence intervals, it's the fraction that will have the true thing in them.  still hard to understand  After weeks and weeks of doing see eyes what that really means? Okay, so let's do a super cool problem.  this I think  blows people away when they see it.  death postponement  simple question. Can you postpone your death?  And I'm not talking about eating healthy for the next 50 years are going to the doctor I'm talking about.  Sitting there in your soul and saying I'm not going to die today.  You laugh.  So that's postponement is this theory that people can somehow delay their deaths in particular. Usually they're doing it so they can make it to some important life event hundredth birthday if your 99.5 years old. Can you hold on?  Does the universe care to desperately want to make it to a hundred or not?  Your kids about to get married.  Maybe you're not doing so well.  Can you hold on?  or just nature decide  Anyhow, I'm going to set up the perimeter for us just because it's not obvious how you might structure something. So let's take all the people that died and let's look at where they died.  Okay, now some will die in the three-month window right before their birthday and some won't.  grateful for every human being if you take their death date and then if we locate their birthday,  Have to see if they died right before their birthday or long way before their birthday.  So write me Nolan alternative hypotheses.  The test whether death postponement is real or not.  If death postponement is pure nonsense.  Them people you just start randomly.  Who knows when they don't care about birthdays or Chinese New Year or anything special? I'm guess if you look at their birthday and you go back in the previous 12 months, they died somewhere in there, right?  And it's just be totally random that is issued. Just B uniform.  And that sound they're just likely to die at any moment is in the other. So if your goal is to get them into that 3-month window.  That should happen in 3 out of 12 of the time or 1/4 now death postponement is real.  Then people should be postponing their death and not dying.  Because they want to hold on for their birthday. So you have this 12 months band, but at least 3 months to like I'm not dying.  So the percentage that died there will be lower than you expect.  So that is less than 1/4.  Yes.  Start-stop louder please.  Why is it 1/4?  there 12 months  that lead into your birthday and three months would be one fourth of them. So if people just randomly dying about 1/4 of the birth or the deaths will happen. Okay.  Okay, so that was a tough thing to set up and it's a sort of interesting way to study. I'd like researchers just choose the 3-month window. Okay. Now if the Knoll is really true.  And you start going and collecting samples?  You're going to get a particular value for p hat. That's the percentage that died in the three-month window before their birthday in your sample. So what sampling distribution will describe this universe that we think we're doing examples out of  I want to shape. I want it Center and it spread.  Have people died.  Hey, there's nothing magical here. You simply need to remember what the sampling distribution looks like for p hat what we look like. Well they want to be normal with all this picture at the beginning of class. They wanted me centered at the True Value.  If you assume it's not.  You're Expecting values near .25  now Square 2pq overend. What school is here? You actually know p&q.  Because you assume H not back when we build confidence intervals. We had to go replace p&q with our best guesses, which came from the sample.  Okay, so that's why I put .25 I'm going 75 here. So this is a difference between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests when it comes to proportions. The hypothesis test has an added Assumption of H not which usually sets of value for p and so that goes in here now, you don't know this number 747 yet.  Because I'm about to give you.  The data that were collected in real life and they happen to have a 747 people. So your answer probably has an ending it is my guess. Okay. So here's what actually happened in Salt Lake City researchers looked at 747 jets.  And they just took each person. They said okay. When did you die and let's look where your birthday is coming up.  And they just said are you really close to it? And the three-month window or was it really far away?  heart all I did and 60 of those 747  according the 3-month window before  So can you take my information and put it into a tight little equation first of all?  So the hard thing about this promise I didn't tell you I just said what's P hat everyone knows what to do. But if I tell you to write some equation. Remember all this all about what's going on in the sample, that should be P hat.  Okay, so here's what we just found.  and our sample 8% of deaths  occurred in the 3-month window before birthdays  What were we expecting to get?  Confidently, what were we expecting to get?  14 that's what we believe right now right here assume. It's not where the coke at Universe. Give me  And my goggles say I'm expecting to see something near 25% and we got 8%  Maybe you don't think this idea so crazy after all so draw me a picture of the sampling distribution.  Ropey hot down on top of it and then shade me an area for the P value in this problem.  What you got?  In car fix my picture the computer will drop Faithfully look at your picture may not be just scale. So here it is centered at the True Value the spread out in this of this picture. Is that square root of p q / end from earlier and here's .08 and I shaved it to the left, but you can't even see it.  Because the curve is so low.  So if you go to your calculator or computer and find the p-value you get 2.67 x 10 to the negative 27.  We just observed a very very rare event.  If the universe really is centered at point to 5.25 universe doesn't want to give a .08 this is how little it wants to give it.  Call wave two choices either we continue to believe in .25 and we got the craziest thing you'll ever see in your life.  Or we can move to the alternative hypothesis that says death postponement is a real thing.  And this is what you should do. You should reject a to not move to the alternative.  No, I'm going to say.  This is just some fluke, right?  Well, the answer is no in fact, you can go read this study about the Chinese Harvest Moon Festival people don't like dying before that if they live in China.  And you can take any group of people and say what does this group care a lot about and then go look and see if they died before it like they should and they just don't seem to die before it.  Now this is prove death postponement is real.  No, because we don't prove the null is true or the alternative is true. We just land somewhere and use that as a belief system to move forward in life, but it does suggest something strange is going on.  And people maybe have some sort of control.  Over there death. Oh my goodness. What is this world coming to?  I choose not to die ever. Everything is boring to me. Every single day is important. I can't I ever  I'll see if it works. I'll call you in a hundred years. Now. Let's do some sample size calculations. These problems are cool because it's pretty easy to figure out what kind of sample size you want to draw if you have some goals in mind. Okay. So here you go Donald Trump's approval rating.  You're the person who's going to figure that out.  Now your boss Demands a 95% CI. This is just a side in okay, a margin of error of 2% You'll call the margin of error is the amount you go each way when building the interval so your best gaskets padded by to margins of error total is the width of the interval one on each side. So online here's a recent approval rating number 41% doesn't seem to change much can't do anything to make that number go up or down.  Other than just sort of noise amounts. What sample size should you draw if your goal is to have all these conditions in place and I felt I want to make an interval that is a really good chance of having the truth in it thing in it that comes from the two percent is sort of a Precision kind of thing.  Okay, I want you to go to percentage weigh when you're building the center Bowl so that the interval that gets created. Isn't that big?  And somehow the sample size is going to favor into all of this factor into re-emerging Vero Beach way. So we need Z * X SE.  To be the number to percent 0 to inches.  Now, you know Z Star for 95% cuz you've memorized by now. It's about 2. It's more accurately 1.96.  And this problem we happen to know a good guest for p&q because we looked online and saw a recent value.  know what's interesting about this problem is if you want a hypothesis test, is this the nicest World cuz you assume H not with Stetson value for p  Hey the next nicest thing you're going to build a confidence interval in life. You're going to go collect some data and the data give up hat. Would you replace on top of pee?  No, this is the dirtiest world.  We have yet to actually collect the data right now. We're figuring out the sample size we want for it. So we don't have a no hypothesis and we don't have a dataset to give is p hat.  So the formula here requires p  So we don't have a perfect thing and we don't even have an approximation. So this is something you do in life. You take a recent result. And you say look who's at?  Now maybe don't like that will fix it in a moment. Okay, but anyhow, we're going to plug in 41% here for p + 100 - that 4 q.  administrative problem about solving for n  now as you push all the symbols around eventually get down to an expression where n is equal to something and and it's usually going to come out to equal a decimal.  Now and represents the number of people you want to put in your study.  So I'm probably not going to put to human beings.  after I have 2323  so there's always a question of which way should you round this number?  International and these problems are always going to round up.  The reason is when you round up it adds more value in more power to your study.  in case what it does, is it effectively make sure  the margin of error is 2% In fact, it'll be a little shorter actually be like 1.99 or something. If you're on this number down it slightly less valuable of a study. So when you go had your answer your little less confident cuz you had one fewer people. So there is a margin of error is actually slightly above 2% * 2.001.  That's why you always round this number up in this kind of setting.  We did the same thing when we doing sample sizes and power calculations. Hopefully went to discussion section this week and saw those so you could have some practice.  now what if  what if there were no number 41% online what it was the first time ever that someone needed to calculate Trump's approval rating. So now you have nothing to go off. Do you have no null hypothesis? You're no data set in front of you with P hat in it. You have no recent estimate.  Is it hopeless?  Maybe not. So let's work with a little less. Okay, so a different political candidate. Maybe you're tired of Donald Trump had enough.  And she just joined the race and you need to approximate to the percentage of people that will vote for her. So this is a common thing when somebody like on the 14th of April like there's not much out there about him. How large a sample must you draw if you want your 95% CI to have a margin error of 3% ISO here willing to build a slightly wider in Turbo.  So everything Begins the same there still a confidence interval formula. It's still taking your best guess and patting it on each side by a margin of error. So you need to make sure a z * x i c comes out to be the number 3 4.03 if your decimal person I'm doing this problem in decimals, just so you can see how that feels and tastes in your mouth.  Maybe you don't like it.  Okay. So what are we going to do here with this p and Q?  ideas  idea  You want to plug in 1/2 4p?  And also for queue why is that a good idea?  biggest  okay, so if the goal is to get this fraction to come out to equal .03  If you let PB 1/2, you're telling me you create the biggest product up here.  Which would effectively create the biggest in value so that the ratio is .03 cuz that's held constant. Right? So why you want the biggest in value coming out of this answer?  Most safe. I like that is the most conservative that is I don't really know what p and Q are but there's some value out there and we need to make sure that our value of n plays well with whatever p&q could possibly be to take them in their worst possible setup.  Wow.  That was fancy. Okay. So here's what we need to solve. We don't know anything about p.  But to make sure and is large enough. We choose the worst-case for P that is when is p x q as big as possible now, maybe you don't believe p x q is biggest when you plug in people's 1/2, but let me convince you.  He was just 1 - P right?  So p x q is p * 1 - P. This is a quadratic equation that has roots at 0 and also at 1  the chi-square term is negative. So the curve goes downward so you probably believe the maximum is right there at 1/2.  Set your goals to make PQ as big as possible. You're maximizing this quadratic and you can see in the image that it happens right here in the middle.  Okay, so you are making the most conservative which is the best way to do this most conservative choice for p c plug this in Hugo solve for n you make sure you round up so we're conservative yet again and the rounding process and you get 1000.  68 people  this is what you do when you have no information in life, you choose an approach that will make sure that it works regardless of what's going on.  Now I wanted to show you another super sexy study.  That is very famous and very recent it came out in your lifetime.  And your adult lifetime almost depending on how old you are.  ESP extrasensory perception. Is there the ability to just  Perceive things beyond the normal senses. Let's try. I'm going to think of a number.  Can you guess my number?  Okay what you think it is?  Do you have it? What do you think it is?  No, it was 527.  Did any of you feel it? Could you sense?  Text are the Espy now doesn't exist. Lots of people think yes is the answer so bam did this interesting study?  And we're not going to be able to do this, but you can use the setup you walk into a room in this computer screen. There's two curtains on the computer screen behind one of them is a erotic image.  behind the others nothing  yorgos to sense where the pornography is. This is the study of images besides erotic ones positive images of like smiles and unicorns and negative things like rain clouds, but the only one that was a venti value was the erotic imagery.  Hey, I don't know why.  So you just have people like tell you is that the left curtain or is it the right curtain and they hit a button on the computer and you record their answer and then you show them which one it was? Okay in the computer to put it behind the people are feeling at the curtains. They're sensing the pornography behind them.  So can people do this better than chance is the question and it turns out he was able to show that yes. They were able to do it more than Chance in This Very controversial study. It was published in very important journals. So I'm going to let you read through this example on your own if you want to see what's going on, but have a good day. "
