    "Full Transcript": "Hope you have an awesome break. I wanted to alert you to this new folder. That's now up and trained Ed final exam materials.  As of 10 seconds ago, so you'll see lots of things like old exams here with answers.  And the final exam info sheet will tell you all the things you need to know most important thing here is that the exam will have roughly equal emphasis across all the 10 weeks. I just take one I said, what's interesting to me this quarter. Let's go make a problem weak to make a problem week 3 and someone that's how I do this.  Now this would be a very long Book You'll see but there's only eight sides with problems. So it's twice as long and the time is actually more than tripled cuz 50 minutes our differential went up to three hours and so on. Another thing is if you want to practice with the actual tables that will be included, which is one reason. It's so long. Those are here.  and  once you guys have submitted your final homework set this folder will become active. This has all of the homework assignments from Spring 2018 when I taught the class, so this you will see they had maybe 17 homework assignments.  All six pages ish. So there's like 100 pages of problems with Solutions.  If you want to go work, even more stuff and try practicing problems when you don't know exactly where they come from for example, so I pick a random homework set and go print out all 100 Pages Shuffle and go.  Whatever you want to do. So there's a lot of resources there.  Took make you good.  Now let's move onto to proportion means to populations.  so in the past  we've mostly dealt with one population things and sometimes there be another population over there, but I completely give you all the information you needed about it so that you wouldn't actually sample from it. Maybe we be studying man and I tell you the woman's number. So yeah, it's a population but you didn't sample from it. It just became the comparison value Sansome hypothesis test.  So now we're actually going to try to sample from two different populations, which we know nothing about know when you do this.  Everything is becomes more notation e suddenly we now have to pee hats. What is the proportion in your first sample the others in your second and sadly, we now have two sample sizes because you might have different size samples. They don't have to be the same.  Now when you do this we're going to do what we did for me switch is instead of thinking about two universes each with their own variability and pictures. We will subtract the ideas and create a single number and we will study what kinds of subtractions could occur which is a very slick approach. Okay, and we can also build confidence intervals. They will be built around the difference in the sample proportion.  And if you want to run a hypothesis test you can check the P 1 equals P2 or equivalently will look at their their difference between zero it so it feels just like means the architecture is just slightly different is all that's going to happen. Now here's what's going to occur if you think about pictures for a moment, if you just looked at one of these sides your drawing lots and lots of samples you could imagine repeating this process and you'll get lots of different P1 hats and if you drop them all in a picture to get something that looks like this blue histogram here, that's a sampling distribution and we can pack know where it centered and how spread out it is from the lecture right before Thanksgiving break.  Any grocery the same thing on the other side and we don't care about those we should care about the difference of those that would just be one picture and it be easy to work with a single picture. So what remains is to figure out what beautiful curve the difference looks like where its entered this is new for the center of where the expected value of the difference in these random variables and how spread out are they? What's the standard error?  No, maybe this won't be so surprising given the you had a slide that look just like this when it came to me.  If you take some things that are independent have nothing to do with each other and they're both normal when you subtract and guess what it's normal. This was previewed on some homework set somewhere right way back when  that's so cute.  Oh my goodness.  And the fact that the center of that difference is just a difference in the center's seems believable right now. How about the spread out in this here? We're going to use the variance formula to help us.  You actually saw this when we were dealing with a means except everything was on a t distribution, but the variance of a difference is the sum of the variances assuming the Two Worlds don't influence each other and they can do whatever they want.  So if you want the standard deviation or how spread out the difference is of any two random variables, it's just a square root of the sums of their standard deviations.  The standard deviation of a difference is the square root of the side squared.  Anything about independent ideas, they're sort of at 90\u00b0 angles to one another they don't influence each other so you can imagine a right triangle.  Philosophy or something around the random variables X and Y.  Okay, so all I need to do now is go and plug-in what's going on here. Now, there's a way thing X is a random variable. It's going to be P1 hat is a proportion you get when you drop off samples from the first population different samples will give different P1 hats. That's why it's a random variable. And in fact, we know how spread out it is because the previous slide shows it right here so I can play the role of this cookie on the left and why would play the role of the cookie on the right to subtract the cookies and get another chocolate chip cookie if they both started his chocolate chip. Okay. So I need to do now is go plug in all the information.  Are spread out in this in the first world?  When I Square it the black square root goes away.  And the red one just stays on.  And when you take that since we're at the black Square who goes away comes through there and you get P to Q 2 / N2.  Now this is admittedly a little nightmarish.  formula wise  But I think by the time you reach 183 of the course number, you're used to a little pain.  And my right CS people are used to lots of pain.  That's what this is my experience from the Cs Majors their lives. Just seen my pain. I don't know if that's true other major seem like it's left pain, but this just what I sort of notice.  Writing code man. It's so frustrating right one little semicolon.  It's just exhausting.  Okay. So now we know what's in the middle here.  If I took this movie universe is tractor that blue Universe I get a normal curve centered at P1 - P2 with this complicated expression for the spread. You say like, what where did that come from? Well came from me taking two different worlds each with their own spread out in this but they were parallel to each other. So it's like this and like this.  Hard to do and then you're asking about the spread out in this of their combination.  Tag me in theater me and I know each of these little pieces cuz I can do one proportion stuff. So, let's see if we can use this in a problem.  OK Google give you all the formulas and have no motivation for where anything comes from in life.  But maybe we can do a little better like we just did.  Give me the name and done many medical problems in here, so I thought it was about time.  So most of you probably use Listerine before or right?  mouthwash named after Joseph Lister  So let's are came along and he said you know, what all these people are dying when we amputate their legs and arms and things.  I wonder if they're dying because the tools are dirty. You know, I just like to take the scalpel from someone else and use it on the next person. Maybe there's something wrong about that. So he had this clever idea of using carbolic acid.  Is a sterilizing agent sort of kill bad things whatever those might because they weren't real sure about what germs and bacteria really were. Okay. So 40 amputations tried with carbolic acid and guess what 34 people survived. I have pretty good then they did 35 without you get the old system just take the dirty scalpel from the floor cut off the leg and we'll see what happens. So only 19 survived make a 95% CI for the difference in survival proportions.  Have amputations done with and without carbolic acid. You can see in the picture here the historical trajectory of Listerine.  From the old timey bottles to today in the yellow color, which was the original.  You probably aren't going to sell many Listerine today using yellow color.  Seems too much like Pine-Sol or chemicals, right?  The color or something and if you take those blue pills to go to sleep every night like me.  Tylenol PM  Problue, aren't they?  Makes you feel sleepy or how about this. I gave you a choice of buying ice cream.  Same exact ice cream. Would you rather buy it out of a rectangular box?  or out of a cylinder  who cares right but you go ask people and they seem to care for some reason what who cares right? But huge percentage that people want a cylinder.  More than 50% once a cylinder. In fact, this is like I hate this stuff. It looks stupid marketing nonsense. They like someone's been like oh that's change the shape and see if people like it more and then they do and I don't I just don't get the world. Anyhow, okay, so you're probably blue and purple colors that are like refreshing and healing in the mouth instead of chemical in hospital. Okay. So let's try this in stages first. Let's see if you can make me some variables.  Add to buy some time for people to write that's why I have to like talk about all this nonsense.  Give me some variables on the page. What is it? We actually care about in this problem.  Okay, someone tell me the variables you defined.  You should not say any numbers in your answer.  topless  go ahead.  survived the percentage of whom  The percent of empty the percent of amputated and percent of amputation surgeries that result in life.  Okay, what else?  Okay, so your P1 with carbolic and your PT with non carbolic you didn't say any hats which I appreciate his hats are about samples.  We don't need variables for those already know what's going on in the samples. I use Pizza MC subscripts can help C4 carbolic and N for nope, not carbolic.  The population is all people ever that could happen. If you Tatian undergoing carbolic if you want or non carbolic if you choose that option for yourself.  Don't know which one is better till we do some stuff what expression do we want to build a CI for?  glad  The difference between PC and PN what order do you want to do them in?  Why did you choose that order?  even PC is  harder larger, okay.  Sounds good to me. I don't care whatever you choose the other order everything comes out negative of my order and it doesn't matter like maybe I weigh 10 lb more than you and maybe weigh 10 pounds less than me the same thing right side or positive Tanner -10 depending on the perspective and prospective get the built-in based on the order you assign here. I usually pick the thing I expect to be bigger to be first just like you did which is very clever of all positive numbers. If everything works out beautifully. Okay next notation on the particular numbers in this problem.  guy who wants to give me the numbers you put  go ahead.  PC hat  April's  Okay.  Can have the other numbers good so I want to make sure people put hats on these things. She recognized her in the sample. If you want it. You can also introduce notation for the sample size, but you don't really have to the important notation for the population parameter plural now and the sample proportions with the hats on them. That's what I most care about write a general formula for the confidence interval.  for this particular setting  I've never given you the formula explicitly before you just have to put all the pieces together.  Okay, who wants to take a chance  No one wants to take a chance.  What will the standard deviation be?  Remember that big conversation about complicated messages and how you're ready for them now?  That's  But the standard deviation so you ready?  Okay, that's fine.  Who's ready?  Come on, go ahead. PC hat - p on hat.  No not times.  What's 4 -  YZ *  Why is Easter and 30 * or?  Text are some other thing.  We assume.  Not exactly.  Normal distribution normal distribution the hairs out of Machine Works populations spit out samples samples turn into proportions those drop-down inform histograms if you repeat, but it before you drop them down you subtract them then drop down.  Then you're doing the difference of two normal ideas, but you know is normal.  The standard error of PC - p and is quite close. It's the standard error of PC hat - p on hat. Those are the random variables PC is not a random variable. It is a number up in the cloud if you did it to everybody and you can call the universe and say hey how many people survive surgery with carbolic acid and it would say 82.742% very good. That's hard you had to just like come up with it based on things you've seen before in the pattern these things follow. So, let's see if you can find the SE now.  push push push on the numbers  your dog is blocking you from doing your work classic excuse doing it in your head that's impressive.  Yes, what is 2.85 * 5.15?  Jennifer.  Can I sew someone tell me the final answer you got?  very scary  you could be wrong should be beautiful.  You know one day I hope.  But you don't get scared by being wrong anymore. Life is so much better.  When you're totally fine with being wrong.  And if you ever want to do anything complicated in life, you will spend your life being wrong. So you might want to get used to it. I mean I make so many mistakes every single day. That's what it's like at the frontier of knowledge. Go ahead.  standard error  .1. Let's see if you got what I did.  Did okay. So there you go .1  now you made a decision to use the hatted versions of the peas in the formula, didn't you?  The formula doesn't have the headed versions in it. Does it?  What else you going to do?  You got no other choice, but to use the headed versions we done this before when we had one proportion and rebuilding confidence intervals. It's okay. It's going to be fine. It doesn't destroy the universe when you make that substitution. So, let's see if you can build your confidence interval now and summarize your results.  I can tell from the fact you said one.  It sure a decimal kind of person aren't you?  Don't know if I would have guessed that about you.  I mean I set the whole problem up and decimals, so I expected it.  Yeah, it sounds like there's only studies you can go read like where are you sitting in the room and its relationship to your GPA or your grade in the course studies on that how fast you come up with things we can probably put in front of you very strong correlation do GPA in the course whether you like silent type getting things right? But never wants to volunteer very strong correlation to hide GPA or high grading some course.  And I can how devastating the Cs Curves in grades are.  Are they devastating?  We're not even done with the course yet.  wrecking crew rowing  Really?  I know you can do this course.  I believe in you. I want to put beautiful hard things in front of you.  I don't want to see what that supposed to be some curve at the end. They're going to be okay 11.4% to about 50. Okay, we all around it at different points. Maybe use my rounded intermediaries. Maybe you didn't use my rounded intermediaries cuz you don't like rounding things whatever. Okay, so we're 95% confidence in what well  A population parameter we're trying to study which here is a difference guy. So it takes a lot of words the true difference in survival rates between MPGs undergoing surgery with carbolic acid versus no.  So it starts getting a very long sentence when it has to be a difference a few things and then finally say is in my particular interval again. This means I am so that most of the time the thing we're trying to measure will be in the interval, but I don't know if mine will or won't it could be a good one. It could be a bad one. Who knows?  Maybe on Bolivar answering you want to check it in or we can do that pop test proportion tests. So what are you do? Well, the first thing that wants is a list of how successful things were 34 people lived in one of our  worlds in 19 lived in the other. How big were your samples when was 4135? Okay. So here's t means concatenate or make a vector. So it's a vector of the successes followed by a vector of the sample sizes. How confident do you want to be in this procedure? That's generating intervals 95.  And you want something called the continuity correction, which we don't do in this class. So you can just a false is roughly the same and different class. Okay, so popped out some interval abstractly like ours. I did a bunch of rounding. Okay, who knows the exact techniques if using underneath the hood to do things. That's roughly close.  Will be just fine. Now. You have to be careful about this. You can't always just do whatever you want in life and think that everything is normally distributed in the world's fine. There's those pesky conditions.  So if you think about it, basically we're taking those blue histograms and we're trying to subtract them and create an object. Right? Well first you need each of those blue things to be normal and we studied right before Thanksgiving how to get that.  Okay, so as you build your sample, you need to be building with independent people or items or whatever.  Which is easily check about the randomization in 10% condition and you need to have 10 successes at least and also at least 10 failures. Okay for studying something and it's not showing up in your sample. You got a problem or if it's all it doesn't show up. Okay, then it's it Xtreme on the other end. It's so over prevalent that you're not seeing examples of the non occurrences and you want to see examples of both in order to have a faithful representation of what's really going on case you need that in a sample population one or simple one and also  Okay. So now you have some pretty blue curbs and now you want to be able to subtract them bring them together.  and you notice that we use this variance formula in order to do that and figure out  and that formula only works if your two worlds are independent of each other.  And the curves are only normal in the subtraction if they're independent.  Okay, if you let the random variable be weights of Americans and you let another random barrel BB weights of Americans and you subtract you don't get a normal curve you get zero exact same distribution. So that's like the opposite of Independence you like the most dependent thing possible.  Let's go to Socrative and see how your cell phone is doing today.  You'll be very excited to learn that I got a new cell phone.  my iPhone 5c I finally got exhausted with  so I am now on Project fi and a Google pixel 3 what comes in the mail in 1 week?  I haven't heard project fi Google's internet service basically uses other people services and goes between the fastest 120 bucks a month for your cell phone bill plus $10 free to give you use of day. Most of your lives are on Wi-Fi that doesn't count as data used. So your cell phone bill will probably be like 25 30 bucks for most people much better than all that other nonsense. Okay to samples something you're studying in the proportion of Interest which would violate The Independents required across the two samples.  Okay, if there's going to be a lack of Independence across the two World, you have to think like let's take someone in the first world like are married men. Okay, cause degrees man like do you have a college degree? And then you go over to the wife?  Do you think you have a guess on the answer before? She says something you won't always be right.  So the question is do people of who get married have roughly the same educational attainment as measured in degrees at universities or high schools answers sort of gas are not completely independent.  Okay, you ask the dad you believe in God. Yes for kid.  Well, they tend to say something similar. Yes. It is. Just like you have to know about the world and see how these things are. Okay, people the same people before and after antidepressant if someone says their gloriously happy before they take the antidepressant.  Don't you pretty much another answer afterwards with like 80 90% Surety.  You're going to say yes again.  Okay, try another one next to some weird normal distribution. Why is it different one?  What is x minus y going to be?  Time to take this question out, I think.  Okay. Why don't you just do you read definitely time to exchange those out for something like we can't figure it out or it won't be normal or something tempting. That's false. Okay, sign the exclamation here to find the center you subtract the centers to find the spread out and it's your first find the variance using the Pythagorean theorem in statistics. And then you take the square root if you want. Okay 90% confidence interval for the difference in Democrats versus Republicans that love Stephen Colbert.  You get this interval 1 to 5.  How would you report your answer?  Okay, so be at the most common wrong answer people of this 90% of the time as soon as I see that that feels like a probability statement.  Probability statements refer to random things a coin that is going to be flipped in the future a die that I will soon be rolling.  Okay, what words come after this probability statement percent difference enjoying Colbert?  There's a percent of Democrats that do if you asked every single one and a percent of Republicans, if you ask every single one and you can pack them is just a number.  That's not a random idea. I will be in our interval interval is also not a random thing sitting there fixed. So you need some sort of phraseology. That doesn't feel like you're applying probability claim to non-random processes and D is the programmed Way by using the word confident instead of percent chance or probability.  You're skirting what's going on?  next  you're going to build a CI in one sample 3 of 10 have it in a second 14 out of 27 habit, which are command will build the 90% CI.  trinkets beliefs  Okay, how many people did we get?  You probably saw on the cute little explanation.  We do not have at least 10 successes and failures.  Look this sample size only has 10 people in it. If you're going to have at least 10 successes and failures or sample size got to be 20, and then a miracle has to happen were perfectly split.  Tricky tricky does sexual orientation affect how much people prefer a certain color?  2001 they study this thousands of people just like you it was the 95% piercing.  LGBT males that like pink - straight males that like pink. There's the confidence interval Mark the true statements.  actual study  this is what you could do with your life if you want.  Psychology Ph.D.  Kind of interesting  Oh my goodness.  There is not a statistically significant difference. That's correct, because zeros in the interval.  If there are no differences between LGBT males and straight males you would expect the difference between 0 and that's in the interval the probability that fix things lying fixed things always a false statement doing the other hors d'oeuvre versus the signage. That's true.  95% confident that  non population parameter  Is an hour interval, that's what the phrase 95% confident Works in a very specific way. I'm 95% confident that true population for him to the care about are in. This interval is it is just some weird like Mountain statement.  Okay, no difference in pink percentage.  Now it's time for hypothesis testing. Now, you would think that would be able to do everything now with this right? There's just one little twist as we'll see in a moment. So first of all, when you set up the hypotheses you set up the difference is 0 it is possible to set it up with something else other that's very non-standard and we won't do that in this class. Okay. So our differences will be zero there alternatives to look like greater than 0 if you think P one is bigger than P2 and that's what you're excited to. Hopefully she'll less than zero if the other words true or two-sided if you care about either then landing on either side of each other  Now here's where it gets interesting. Normally when you run hypothesis test you looking for that one number that you can look up on a distribution and shade an area, right?  So that's usually called the Z statistic if you're working on a normal curve or t statistic so hear what we're going to do to take our value to check the Knoll and / the spread out of this. That's what we did when we had one population.  What will do the same thing here with two populations except it's just a little more complicated. Our best estimate of what's going on is the difference in the we saw in our two samples.  The hypothesized value here is actually going to be zero for you.  I'll be the most boring thing if the two populations were the same right and we're going to divide by the spread out in this.  And here's the tricky think so all of this fits the pattern the Paradigm that we've been doing so far that's gas - hypothesized value / spread out in this move you to a standard normal distribution.  But they spread out and it's actually we have a way to sort of squeeze more philosophical accuracy in numerical accuracy out of what's going on in school pooling and we never done it before this is the first time you really see it.  Okay, so there's this other formula we're going to use so you'll notice here when you use this formula for the standard. Are you still sort of feel like there's two populations and they each have their own proportion going on. What what happens is when you do a hypothesis test. The first thing you do is assume the Knoll  which says yeah, there's two populations, but the thing you're measuring in them. I think that's the same.  So what you can do to hear what do we do? We took keyone without a hat and we replaced it with P1 hat. That was our best guess of what was going on.  But as soon as you assume that the two populations sort of match up on the thing you're measuring you can get a better thing to put in place of P1 hat here and hints to 1/2 and also Pichu hat. So here's how you pool. You say. Okay, I collected some data over here and Sample one and some over here in Sample to what if I United them into a jumbo sample the size of the jumbo sample would just be the sum of the individual sizes in the number of successes. When I bring them together would just be the songs of the successes.  And this is my most faithful.  Idea about what's going on. If you think the two things have the same proportion going on why not to bring it all together into one giant data set.  As some people philosophically disagree with this you should know.  But for now, we'll just try out the idea and see if you like it.  Okay, I mean think about it this way. I'm flipping a coin. Okay, and I'm counting up my heads. You're flipping a coin and counting up your heads if we think both of our Warfare, why don't we bring all our data together into one super dataset?  Traded to determine that 50% furnace that we both secretly believe in or maybe they're not both are maybe they're both like a third wheel, pet with the exact same coin. We can bring them together, right? And so it's like I'm more honest version of what's really going on in some sense. Okay. So in this Listerine example, if you pull it you really had 75 people undergoing amputation send Henry 34 + 19 survive. So this is our best guess given how we believe in the universe right now or what's going on. So when it comes to finding this a d stat for going to go find some areas, okay, we still have this P 1/2 - P2 had but now we're dividing by ASAP pools and you only do this on hypothesis test for two proportions.  That's pretty unique setup.  Now the formula still looks very similar. It still has two big terms being added together with a huge square root on them. And you still sort of do have two populations and there's variability as you draw samples from them. Okay, but now our best guess when we replaced P1 with something is use the most data available to us and put P hat pulled here will also do the same thing over here in the second spot where P2 would normally go.  the best thing I can come up with for P22 taking all of the data in putting in a big bin and saying it's what you do is going to be  so there are a lot of reasons why people pool data.  So one has to do with like using your data in the most powerful way possible based on what you currently believe.  Okay, there's also something about the central limit theorem. It will call that things get better proxies like normal approximation. We talked about it better and better with more and more data. So if you sort of like consider all the data in one big pot suddenly have a bigger sample.  You know, I didn't have 40 and whatever and have 1435 separately suddenly of 75 being leveraged in two different ways in two different populations. Okay?  So anyhow, let's go try running a little hypothesis test now that you've seen this so same setup as before.  Let's see if you can write some hypotheses.  same parameters  Okay.  You ready? What's H not?  helpless  Okay, and your alternative?  Okay, so it's one way to write them. You're moving everything to one side. Totally fine. Here's the other way. Okay, if you want to write this cc equals p a n b c is greater than p on the other side of this is like this is often how human being stink like my world bigger than your world not that much of a difference is positive the downside of writing it like this is you're not in the subtraction e mood and so you may so I don't forget to get everything in this problem happens on the difference. So pick your poison, whatever one you want to do is totally fine. I don't really care find the SE in this setting.  It is not the same as when we built the confidence interval.  What you got?  in the previous problem  We didn't believe that our two populations with the same on the thing. We are measuring.  Okay now assuming it's not doesn't for spooling for everyone in the world some people like to use pooling and we'll use it for a while just so you can see it and experience it in this class. But when you got in the real world, there's like the people that pull the people that don't pull the people that will only use things called exact tests. It's a big mess and back there seven at least seven different ways so I can do this stuff that we're doing right now for two proportions. So I don't want you to believe they like there is a right way to do this. Some people just think like it's just a way to be more faithful to the situation.  What is that wrong in what sense wrong like on an exam? Yes, because I want you to learn pooling just to learn this technique not because I necessarily believe it's the right answer in life.  It's like a scale you do lots of things in life that life turn out to not really be the way things are done.  Okay, and I can go sit with this in so some people that call that makes total sense. So bring all the data together and do a big pool in like that's our best. Guess you too and you're replacing them with like your best guess or most honest representation of what's going on. Some people feel like that should just be P1 that other people say no I disagree like pulling things to make sense in some strange way.  I'll give you a little more time to decide if you're Pro or anti pooling.  You can ask me neither.  You don't have to pick a side or not at War right?  my pooling that is  does anyone have their thing now?  What you get?  proceed  I want the number the final result. Did you pull the things together? Dump them in the pool?  Okay, did anyone get their SSI yet?  What you get?  point 0 1 7 3  anyone get something different would you get  You got .105 so someone did something wrong.  Okay, I got .105.  Okay. So now look before when we did the SE and we weren't pulling back in the confidence interval. We got .10 with pool and we get .105. Look. It's basically the same right like we're worrying about a bunch of nonsense in the third decimal place. Okay.  Sorry how yes, if we plug it in in both spots here. It's kind of frustrating.  Write the general expression without numbers for the test statistic. Okay, I'll do this since we're running low on time. It's always just your best guess what year is a difference.  Minus the hypothesized difference which would be 0 for you / the standard error that came out of pooling.  Let's see if you can find the Z stat.  And the P value for this particular problem?  You got to go fast.  Okay, hopefully push the numbers through you got 2 .92 you want to find the P value?  Kdrama me a picture. The reason you did the Z stat is to move yourself to the standard normal. So nervous system standard normal with me dropping 2 .92 shading to the right I N E P value.  We should probably believe in sterilization as a good idea after this. Okay, we got to stop.  Have a great day everyone. "
