    "Full Transcript": "Okay, folks for back ready to learn some new things. So let's go. So we started talking about data the other day now it's time to think about how that data is collected and I'll put this obvious statement up here, but the way in which you collect data.  Has a profound impact on the quality something that everyone in the room would agree to if you ask them.  But the question is how does one get quality data?  If This Were an easy question then we wouldn't have had issues like the polling around the last election which is incredibly inaccurate  when do from one month lens so  Let's talk about the different phases of getting nice data. The first thing we want to do.  Whenever you're cooking data, there's some big population you care about this might have millions of people. It might be everyone in the US and might be all US citizens. It might be people with social security numbers and so on. So what you do since you can't talk to millions of people  You draw a smaller question called a sample. In fact, if you do try to talk to everybody people died as you were in the process of talking to people so there's never a well-established like this. Is it because things are always changing. So you draw this small sample and sampling is simply the science and there is a very complicated science here of making sure that your sample looks as much like the population as you can.  So calling people on the phone and ask him who they're going to vote for?  It's not a good idea because lots of people don't have home phones. For example.  So it's very tricky to make your sample look like the population. So here's a couple of examples is most probably done this.  Heating up food and tasting it for the right level of spice and adjustment is nothing more than sampling. So you might have a big pot and take one sip the soup is your sample day all voters in the next election and we might go reach out to a thousand and seven of them as we said by a home phone now, unfortunately whenever you do this  You can create a situation where the sample isn't exactly like the population.  And when this happens, it's called bias.  If you've ever wondered what bias really means it's a discrepancy between the overall look of the sample and the overall look of the population and there is so many different kinds of bias. Okay, so you can see ways things could be biased about are two examples.  So I just mentioned home phones. Lots of people don't have those anymore. They're mostly going to call older people and they don't look like the general population.  The other thing you'll notice is in this voting election example is all people that plan on voting in the next election. Some people don't decide whether they're going to vote or not until the day of the election depends on how things are going out of holes. Look if they're able to make the bus that day Etc. So it's not even a well-defined population until the moment. It's needed to be itself the day of the election. You can see problems with soup here. If you don't stir things nicely before you sample them and song you have biased samples when you take your little ships.  So people have come up with all different kinds of ways to try to stample in a way that will reduce by us.  The first thing you do is you take your population and let's say we want all people in the US.  And you say okay first thing to do is to find this universe that I'll actually sample from just because you define all people in the u.s. Is your population doesn't mean you can actually in any reasonable way try to connect with those people. So you might say okay. I'm only going to use people that have social security numbers because that is a way to actually connect to people  Of course.  You just changed the universe really you in from all people knew us plenty of people in the US don't have social security numbers and now they are not part of the University or drawing phone. Whoops. It seems so innocuous you wanted to actually be able to do something in the world. She made a choice, but you've already biased what's going on.  Now one sugar sampling frame. Hopefully you didn't destroy the population when you're doing that and it looks pretty similar.  First thing you might rise with called a simple random sample SRS. This is one of the most common things if you have a sampling frame, you have some way of identifying everybody in it. Maybe it's a social security number. Maybe just like number everyone in the class 1 through 400 in this room.  And then you just pick randomly from that identification to get to your human being. So if we have this box which represents the sampling frame and there's all these. The blue ones are the ones we've it looks like fun Pennies on the ground and Weber Penny lands. You can actually talk to that human being  that is seems like a silly way to do things, right?  It randomly choose people but it turns out that this is one of the most effective ways because every time you try to get clever in life.  You do something that you don't realize introduces bias.  Soon as you went to the Social Security numbers, I tell some people are like, oh, yeah, that seems like a good idea. Whoops.  We just left everyone without their social security numbers out of our sample. We may not even realize it may be in spot everyone in the US has one.  Is there anything that everybody in the US has documentation wise?  Okay, so if you want it in the US to get a true simple random sample, you would have to jump out of an airplane at random places in the US.  And walked to the nearest human being you saw however, you would do that. I don't know. OK Schnauzer there places in the US you can be dropped there would be bad and you're probably going to die places in Alaska news ranges stop at anyway, it's very hard to like truly get a simple random sample. So some people will do other things when an SOS seems pretty hopeless or when they want to try to get a little more clever. So let's look at but cleverness she might do stratified random sample. So a strata is just a slice of something.  So maybe you care about the average GPA UCSD students and maybe you've heard cuz your friend is in graduate school or your brother or sister that and graduate school. They only give out good grades. Everyone has a super high GPA for a b minuses and 1/2 in graduate school dance sort of true. So the problem with doing a simple random sample is you might be afraid that it won't be just it won't be portioned out correctly between grads and undergrads may be worried about that. But that might happen so you would say okay, we're going to break UCSD and a to strata undergrads Brad's and I'll go do a simple random sample in the undergrads. We're going to have lower gpas. Sorry and grads will have higher and play the GPS and then recombine those and some clever weighted average or something.  So if you're worried about missing some stratum in your simple random sample, this is valuable and it's really important when you have a stratum that is a small percentage.  So for example, maybe you care about some sexuality studying. You want to know what transgender students think well this number somewhere between 1/2 and 1 and a half percent based on some studies. So a simple random sample is unless you ask a ton of people because they're a low probability event. So this is when you would use the stratified sample.  Okay, another idea. That seems like so much work undergrad and grad. How do I find out? Who's what I want something is purely convenient from me. This is one approach to doing things and it's called cluster sampling to take your universe and you break it in two different clusters. Sometimes this is geographical clusters. Sometimes it's an organizational thing that exists on top of your empty like you're all in different colleges, right? Those are clusters here so I can go talk to people that mirror and Eleanor Roosevelt and all this stuff, right?  What's going on in this is reducing some convenient structuring of the universe to help do this and this example here. We just go to a bunch of gyms on campus and just start talking to people cuz it was convenient and hopefully everyone goes to the gym for this to make any sense here, right?  Now there's a big difference between these two worlds up here to see they're both of biting them in the slices. Right but you can see I've made some horizontal and vertical to stress that they're doing something different when you look at the slices on the top. It's cuz you believe the people in the slice look very similar.  Undergrads have a lower grads have higher gpas across the different strata. They're different.  Okay in this one when you look at the people who go to gym one, it's the mixture of undergrads and grads so you can get all sorts of gpas. So everyone is different in these is a hetero within the sample and across a different slices. It's a homogeneous one gym is the same as another gym who really cares, but if you look up here what's going on if it within people are quite homogeneous on what's going on with them relative to what you're measuring and across their heterogeneous.  So it's just a way to leverage the different approaches. So that's basically what I just said, you can look at the homogeneity and I had originated within and across the slices you've created.  And that defines weather doing stratified sampling for clustering and clustering you break things up because it was convenient up and geographical things when you need to study San Diego when you say all just go to Kensington and then Hillcrest and then UTC and so on convenience ain't it? Nice and I'm not saying these are all good ideas and how to recombine them is super complicated. So typically people who really really want to study things in life regarding sampling will go take entire classes in the thing but there's just a taste. So you realize hey, this is actually kind of complicated.  So you're going to tell me now what can go wrong in life.  So here's an actual thing that happened to me. I have a lot of students to go work at Facebook.  Remember that whole Cambridge analytica thing.  Yeah, my former students was the head of the department designed to try to fix that big little problem that Facebook has you shake your head. You're disgusted with Facebook you giving up on them.  You're not on FB.  You can't I hate it, but I do it.  Kind of have to be now. You don't I'm not  But I'm also not 21, I guess.  We want to know how much Americans love Facebook that was the question.  first thing population Americans variable you care about their love  I'll be want to make sure that have them write a poem. I don't know.  You might say okay. I'm going to sample from people on Facebook in the US.  Once you do that you might say okay that's complicated. I don't have access to random Facebook people in the u.s. What can I get access to boss? He says well, how about your friends?  You access to them, don't you and he's like, yeah, I have access to them. Okay, great. So I got 5000 friends on Facebook. So work at Facebook. So when I'm going to go do is pull up sample. I sent them all the survey and I said, please respond. I need this for my job and 437 people respond. So going from the bottom up. I want people to tell me what was garbage me about that movements and then we'll do that movement and we'll do that movement who wants to do the bottom one. Go ahead.  Non-response bias. What's that mean?  OC feel like we need some percentage of  what percentage of the pot of soup do you eat before you had enough of the pot of soup?  1% 10%  50  You clearly never run a survey in your life. You'll never get 50%  but I like your idea but it turns out first.  You don't need a percentage.  For example, if I take a pot of soup and you try a couple steps and you like taste good if the soup or 10 times as big would you take 10 times as many steps?  Probably not.  Okay, so it's not a percentage of the whole which is one of the biggest misconception people have about sampling turns out it's just the amount.  Now it's more complicated than that. So we're going to hold on to your idea for later. You won't talk to me about the bottom one.  Yeah.  How do I get you I'm saying if the target frame it, we just accept the target frame say that's okay. Just accept that's okay, even though it's not what's bad about what's happened below.  okay, so something about  the people who actually responded may not look like all 5000. Okay, which goes to something about non-response bias. So the people that actually respond to things in life don't look like all people there people who have time women respond to things that are volunteer opportunities way more than men just data. I don't know why so this is this group will look nothing like that. Unfortunately people called volunteer bias people who want to do things in life. Don't look like all people  Okay, let's do the next level of dirtiness it when you move from the sample frame and that Target frame came up.  Go ahead.  Facebook employee  Facebook friends of a Facebook employee will like Facebook more than people on Facebook.  My friend who works at Facebook these 5000 people. They probably all work at Facebook to write although they do have their internal Facebook thing now.  Yeah, so there's some problem here. Okay, so you can call this up two different things convenience sample bias is one of these you took like a legitimate thing. Okay Facebook users in the ask me like that inconvenient for me. I want something super convenient.  And usually that introduces some bias they last one.  Go ahead.  Good. So people that hate Facebook probably are going to be on Facebook, right?  Except that guy.  Now that's good. So here's another problem. You can give it some name bad sample frame As you move and tried to create the world from what you were going to dry. You didn't do it in a way that was faithful to the original Universe you were thinking about so these things are all incredibly subtle right just like I didn't realize I just destroyed everything and the problem is often you need to actually do something in life. And so you need some way to actually contact human beings and so you just have to introduce bias. So it's not all avoidable. Unfortunately, okay, you want to do a study on UCSD students I go walk to the register and I say will you give me their data and they say no will give you some people's data-only undergraduates.  Okay. Well Suddenly It's a different world that I'm really studying even though that's not what I wanted to do.  Okay, so what's that? You can actually make a good sample and you go collect some data.  They're different kinds of data. We talked about the structural nature of continuous discrete and these kinds of things but what the data can tell you in life is something else so you can really think about data into camps. Something is simply observational. It was just data that got collected about some people or some things but when it was being collected it didn't interfere.  Okay, any data that you're collecting sort of after-the-fact if I look at GPA of students from 1997 UCSD that just data like I didn't do anything. I didn't I didn't interfere with the values that were created there. It's just adah that are making observations about people.  Okay, so you have the sample and you go just collect some data know some observational studies are in the moment. Okay. I sit behind a mirror that no one knows it's there and I just record how can people check the phone on DQ's class. Okay. No one knows you're watching you right now.  You're just being observed.  Okay, so here's an example looking at transcripts. For example.  You study newspapers from meme usage.  Kind of already printed when they were getting printed. They didn't ask you if they should use more memes or not than they were.  In contrast to that is what's called an experiment. You've all heard of this before and what's important here is it had your collecting the data you had some hand and how it was being created. It was Guided by the hand of the researcher. Now the most typical experiment people will do is what's called an ABG study where you have Group B, you're randomly dumping people into one of the two groups and the only thing that's really going to differ about your two groups is that one of them is going to have nothing exciting going on and the other will have something very exciting. For example, the treatment group might get some new drug while the control group gets a sugar pill called a placebo that just looks like a pill and they have no idea what's in it. So you have forcibly change the way the data are going to appear because you sort of people into one or two bins.  Bothers both of these are valuable as you'll see you in different settings and college. Here's some examples new drug is the most common one, but maybe you are an engineer and you care about making waterproof cell phone. Okay, so you go and try new waterproofing materials on a bunch of phones and you try some nursing them versus phones without your beautiful new waterproofing material the day to get generated you influenced by putting things into an a vs. B.  So in addition to sort of the general setup of these is the most important thing when you have observational data when you did not control how the data got produced any conclusion you draw about Thursday table will be in association.  That is a relation between two quantitative variables. It is non-causal.  Whereas when you do an experiment, you can actually refer you can actually make causal claims. This drug works. It cures cancer because I took thousands of people in dump them into one of two bins Bene. They took a sugar pill bendy. They took my drug and guess what he got better and because I randomly put them in the only way they differ.  It's by the treatment they got.  This group can't have more women than that group because I randomly assigned it and with enough people random assignment will put people into the bins with equal amounts.  And every other variable do you might be worried about the split evenly across them? That's the beauty of the study. So it's at the splitting step here. If you do this randomly, and don't try to do anything fancy, you will have made the group's look identical in every way.  Accept what the researcher end up doing to them which is where you put a hand into the data.  Now there's different ways to do these kinds of experiments. For example, it really helps. If you don't tell people whether they're in the treatment or control.  Okay, if you know you're getting the drug, you will feel better.  And if you know, you're not getting it you'll feel worse.  That's just how the human mind works psychosomatic effect when you think something's going on with you. You feel it whether it's true or not.  It's stunning that this happens.  In case you can't tell people what group they're in also, you can't tell the people running the experiment what group is going on. So when the nurse brings the white pill he or she should not know that this actually has medicine in it or not because they're subtle.  the personal say all I sure hope this is the drug and she'll be like  that pause and you know that she knows that it's the drug. So now you're going to start feeling better. I was in a double time study when I was a kid cuz I might asthma was so bad and I asked the doctor I said, please I need to know if I'm in the study and he says one I can't tell you into I don't know. I don't know you're running this. Obviously there has to be someone that knows stuff right someone at the store people in the bins and make a decision. But that person is not the one who's recording the data analyzing the data writing the papers there just a person who does sorting and that's it and they have the knowledge and they never interact with the patients. So it's called the double blind.  officer Prado  Time for you to do stuff.  Let's see if we can get the room to not break. What do you say?  There's too many of you.  pre-socratic how to handle  the rim name is DQ my initials. Let's see if we can get anyone in the room today.  What's up?  No, this is not for any grade.  That's great. You can you can you can see someone else's phone and you guys can collaborate.  And it's not working anyway, cuz it's too many people in the room blowing up the internet.  Or whatever is going on. Is anyone with actual CS knowledge of your in it some buttons just hit one and see if it'll go. It's not showing up anyway.  This is never not worth. It is just this room.  It's not showing you actually in the room if the problem.  the nuns in the room  Hey, we're going to wait a sec. And I want someone to talk me through what answer you would have picked no more and an MD. Sorry.  Are you ready to go?  Can you chose a simply randomly choosing from the roster? It's a bit circular and it's evidence. Right? So everyone in the room has it everyone in this has some identifier right? And then just going to randomly choose from the identifier list, which then gives you the people so, it's good. This is just a simple random sample. Let's see if I had next.  I'll let you read this.  I see you so you guys can still answer this but I just don't get your data. That's weird.  how to report internet  Okay, so someone who got this, right?  It isn't just reading the answer back to me.  Talk to me through your thinking.  Go ahead.  What are the two groups?  LGBT non-lgbt there different.  Within are they the same?  will there be variation always but  okay, so why are they different the groups from each other?  Supposedly LGBT people have more siblings and non-lgbt Pitbull.  that true  you say stratified with the answer key says okay. So this is interesting. This is a case where you would only figure this out if you knew a lot about LGBT birth patterns, so as a woman has more and more kids the probability that they self-identifies I'll be LGBT goes up the later you are in the kid order and there's all these like a genetic reasons for this that are super complicated that I don't really understand. But if you just like go ask a bunch of people who are all of the firstborn and you say do you self-identify this way, you know, you get some percentage. Let's just make up a number 5% Okay, and then you go ask a bunch of people who all second born in their family. And for some reason they're a little more LGBT.  Then they all the firstborn people.  Surprising, huh? This is date. I just like to go collect us a million two people inside you. I didn't identify this way and then you realize oh my gosh, why did being later in the birth order make you more likely to self identify this way.  And then if you're going to do this study and you have these two groups about sibling count or whatever.  Then you would definitely do a stratified sample.  Start again. We're going to ask everyone in this class using Socrative, theoretically.  What kind of sample would that be?  Okay, I'm going to talk to me.  What do you say? Why do you say none before you read the answers?  Can hear you louder please?  The entire fight so they still UCSD students. That's a population, right?  So this is some group some subset.  everybody wants some  Hey, let me help build on your idea. If somebody sent me a cluster sample, you should imagine the universe and then you should divide it up into some pieces and you should be talking every single piece.  Some small random subset of each piece students and all I did was take a piece.  Y'all don't even talk to any of the other people. So they just a garbage sample is all this is like you want to know about UCSD. You don't go to math 183 you do not look like UCSD on average.  right  I think that's true.  No, no.  Okay, obviously, we haven't done cluster yet. I'm not going to give you any question with answers cluster.  I'm going to say which of these actually do clustering.  This is a select Mini.  possibly meaning  Okay, so I'd like someone to tell me what the stratified samples are in this and why they're stratified. This one cares about clustering. So these are not the one you're used to losing right now.  Don't talk too much other people. Go ahead.  So let's talk about a so these strata should look similar within themselves would be different across them. So tell me what's different today.  Okay, so if you talk to people that had a sibling attend UCSD their sibling count must be greater than or equal to one.  If you talk to those that don't have siblings attend UCSD all you know, it's greater than or equal to 0 so suddenly they look much different.  The minimum value attainable needs to see why are these strata looking different from each other but internally consistent her.  Okay, good. If someone has if you're it from a family with a minivan probably cuz they're lots of kids. So sibling, will be high or is those who don't then it'll be low. Okay. These other ones were correct, right. It is break the universe into pieces and go talk to some of the pieces fit.  And then you just we combined it all together and it was all convenience by Major that super convenient and dorm is even more convenient. You can walk to a physical place and just randomly choose them if they walk in on Saturday night.  Okay.  A good question so you don't have to talk to other pieces. Actually. It depends it's super complicated. It depends if when you're breaking it up if the pieces are actually going to look have some difference like okay if you care about like LGBT percentage and you decide to skip Hillcrest as one of your clusters and using the neighborhood then you've missed something really important, but sometimes it doesn't really matter and sometimes you just can't talk to them. Also, ideally talk to them all into a simple random sample in each, but you can  Yes, then it's fine to take a random collection of the pieces, but that's not often done because usually you're picking the pieces based on some interesting thing where they might differ Geographic for example, so it just depends by dorm. I don't know. Do you think the dorms are different here?  I don't know.  So I go talk to the mall because I'd be worried about the random five dorms would be that would be not representative. That is okay. Anyhow, it's okay next thing you want to do descriptive stat. We're going to jump to the end here cuz it's most important you have your beautiful data set. It was built from the perfect sample ever and you need to communicate this to other human beings and human beings. Don't really know anything about anything.  What are we going to do? So here comes the hard part?  So if you have a data data based on numbers and people will tend to use the center and the spread as ways to communicate their information. These are just called statistics which are ways of taking lots of data and combining them down to a single number.  Could people like a single thing as a summary of different statistics? So for example, the mean and the median are both statistics, you should remember this because asked and Sample though start with s  We're going to eventually be talking about something else called a parameter. This is something that has to do with a population p goes a t s goes with s.  Okay, how much you figure out the sinful nature of a big list of numbers? Well, you've done some of these before back in second grade. It's time to revisit them. The important thing here is that they are we're going to start with realize that they're all measures of center. You're trying to determine the Crux record or nugget of a data set with maybe a million data points.  So the median is like the median in the road in the middle right have two roads on one side half the roads on other. So if you have a dataset put in order from smallest to biggest to help their numbers, which is where we are right now with numeric data types and then simply list off the one that's halfway in Into the dataset Now if this is one right here cuz it will be an even number on each side. If unfortunately of an even number of data points and people just made a decision about what they're going to do in life. They take the two ones that are in the center and they averaged them together again, it helps that their numbers so that you can average so the median of this weird data set is 3.5 still noticed that number is not actually in the data set.  You can report out something. That's not actually one of the members of The Thing.  If we assign people that identify as female in this room are one and mail is 0 and you want the median.  It might be point five or if there happened to be more men than women. Then there are more zeros digging through the first half of the dataset in the median is just zero, so weird and strange measure but there are a lot of Pros to it. Now. You've seen the other one. That's very, this is called the mean also known as the average. Those are synonyms choose which one you love in life.  And use it. So the problem with the median is it doesn't actually take into account the particular values that are going on.  So for example, these two data sets 4 5 6 in 45990 will have the same median. The number in the middle is 5 but these were they ignored the actual values like 990 vs. Fixed. Like there's a difference it somehow the meeting doesn't care. So if you'd like some measure of center that actually looks at the values themselves every single one of them than the mean will do this it simply defined as adding them all up and dividing by how many there were.  This idea works very well when your data set has finitely many data points in it, cuz the denominator will be a finite number.  When your data set has infinitely many things.  You going to divide by Infinity?  We'll have to deal with that situation later. I'm going to dataset have infinitely many things you say. Okay, we'll get you that now these are just numbers. They also have conceptual things behind them that you may have never thought about before. So now do you know what a histogram is you could draw a histogram of all these beautiful numbers are so excited about summarizing and it turns out that the median is the place along the x-axis where half the area is to the left and 1/2 is to the right because when you make a histogram every datapoint just free it's a little bar of area. So have two points are to the left and right and have the area should be to the left and right.  Okay. Now the mean is more complicated and this is difficult to actually prove but people often will just sort of into it that this is true the mean at the place on the horizontal axis, but if you put your finger there and you cut out the histogram out of cardboard it would balance on your finger and it wouldn't tilt and fall off.  So what happens is you're actually caring about the values if you have some big values in your data said you get these colored dots way out here.  And that creates a sort of pork effect. We need to bring your finger over to balance that out.  You can see how the mean by actually looking at the data values and then coming into play is exploring the spork.  Okay, you're trying to think.  Median vs. Mean  How are the mean and median related and these data sets? So I ask you this one starting to have more skewed to the right and then we have something that's even more skewed to the right. So you're going to figure out if the median and mean look like this or flip the other way or about equal.  I'll give you a minute and then we'll have someone tried to convince the class.  enough thinking time  who wants to talk to us?  Go ahead.  Stop the lower the skew the closer the mean and median will be that is a true statement.  In fact when there's no SKU when it's perfectly symmetric the right on top of each other now.  value of a medium of Exchange  So you say that as it gets more skewed to the right.  The mean pulls out that way in the median doesn't change that much.  It depends on the nature of the skew and how many points are pulling out on us. But you're right. Okay, so if you want to see actual values hear the actual values for the mean and median of the data sets as you start to pull values way out to the right and create SKU write a really big values numbers and when you average those it brings the average up.  The median however is just saying I want to find the middle data point I don't care what you did with it top 20% of the data out of the top 30 play with the top 30% of the data all you want it won't affect me cuz I always just walk to the middle.  So that's why the median doesn't move much. Now you start pulling a lot of the data as you're trying to skew it actually does move the median a little you can see the meeting got pulled up a little with my examples.  But the difference between these two is growing. They started out point one apart then point 4 ish then point 7 ish. So that that's growing now if you screw the date off to the left and start messing with all the small bags of the data and making really small then the mean goes the other way and it's actually less than the median. So just depends on which way the data is skewed the median just wants to sit there and not move around very much.  And this suggests the following it helps us pick which measure of center we want to use.  So here's three other data sets just as another example, I calculated the median and the mean and all of these and you can see that as we take the Top Value and just mess with it and make it 10 times as much and 10 times as much that the median doesn't even move and the meanest of growing out of control. So if you want a measure of center.  That is really robust and doesn't change if you just change one or two data values.  Then the median is the better choice for you because it's very resilient. But if that's not what you're looking for in life, you want something that's really sensitive to every single data point that could possibly happen. The mean is a better choice. There is no right answer here in real life people tend to have the following mental rubric not saying it's like the best thing is just a convention that serves people best most of the time which is use the median whenever you have some weird distribution. Maybe it's highly skewed.  Or you have something with crazy outliers and the reason is because the median will not be affected by this weird few or outliers. It will still try to get to the heart of where most of the data lives.  If you have something with pretty nice and gentle that symmetric and not too many outliers, no crazy outliers, then people tend to use the meat now. It's going to be close to the median so we could always just use the median according to this but the thing is human beings understand the me. Everything you do in life is average is right. No one in the world understands what immediate is  So unfortunately, sometimes you have to make your choice about what to do in life based on the people with whom you are going to communicate and their expertise level, which you're going to find out is usually low.  Okay, you're sitting in this class and flies are in the top 1% of quantitative thinkers in the country probably.  So you need to realize it's about communication.  No, unfortunately, the center doesn't tell all  So for example here to datasets, they have identical measures of center. They're both centered around 5. They're both symmetric yet. They're still something radically different about them. So the spread is a numerical idea that tries to capture out price of capture how tightly compress the data is or how spread out it is through the zone that it lives in.  Okay. So on the one on the left the date of pretty tight around this value 5. Yeah, you can see things at 8 or 2 but they're not that common cuz the grass ain't so high. Where is this graph? You really do see lots of values out at 8 and 2 they come up all the time. It's spread out.  So again, there's lots of ways to measure spread. So let me give you three.  Here's the most garbage e the range all you do is take the biggest value in your data set to check the smallest and report that out positive number. It's the distance between the thing on the left everything. I'm very right it's arranged over which the data exists.  And it's a numbers. Please bigness of that space the problem with this is only using two data points to decide how spread out the data are that seems like a bad idea. If I choose to people in this room to decide what the average gender is in this room of the average race, like these two are not representative of the room, right or if I take the people in the very top and bottom like is it foolish ideas when you actually apply them to some real-world thing right the pro is that human beings can understand this easily.  You tell me how big the Date A Live in the next thing the interquartile range. This is more sophisticated, but it's the same idea. It's the Span in which certain data live. It's not all the data. Here's the middle 50% of the data. How wide are they? So what you do is you find what it called the upper quartile and lower quartile. So let me show you that. These are people's favorite prime numbers less than 20 when you ask a class.  Guy just looks like snow has basically but I put in an order and once it's an order I can find the median. It's the one in the middle right have to do this to the left halves to the right.  That's marking the 50% way into the data set.  What you could do, if you could take the first half and you could find a median of it and that would tell you the 25% of the way in half of 1/2 is 1/4. So the lower quartile q1 is the median of the lower half of the data set and some people will include this number 7 when they're finding it and some will exclude it. Okay. This is definition differ. I'm not really interested in testing these weird definition of differences. But let's just look at the to the left of the median and find its median. So, I'm sure that's three you can do the same thing take the upper 50% find its middle. That's the 75% Mark and then all you do is you take those two values you found and you subtract them.  It's telling you that the distance between the 25% and the 75% is this amount? The IQR inter means between quartiles are like quarters are 25% and range is a span of how big something is.  Now what school is you can report everything you sort of need in one nice little thing called the five number summary.  So these are the five most important data data values in your data set. So the biggest and the smallest.  Here's the median. It's called Q2 if you like.  it's 50% of the way in it may be an actual data value or maybe the average of 2 if there's an even number of data points use q1 and Q3 another nice thing about this presentation is you can go find  The IQR in the range in this so 50% of the data must live between q1 and Q3. And if you subtract those you will have found the IQR and 100% of the data live between the Max and then subtracting knows will give you the range.  We're going to skip that for a second and go to the third idea. This is the one you probably seen a lot of academic papers were going to be using this a lot more in this class. Then IQR. This is called a standard deviation of the data set given a name y 1 through y n so we have these and data points. So the first thing you're going to do is find the average people use Y Bar for that day. That's a number.  The standard deviation formula is as follows. Now. The reason that this formula is the way it is is very complicated and is something that if you take math 181a, you can finally understand but for now it will remain slightly mysterious but here the main ideas.  If you want to know how spread out the data set is first figure out word centered and then just say well let's measure how far everyday to point is from the center if all the data points are clustered together.  Then all of these differences will be quite small.  And if it is really spread out.  A lot of these differences would be quite there some obese model and will be medium, but lots will be large.  So that's how this is measuring thing. So you just subtract each data point from the average and you square it because I don't care if you're above the dataset or below the dataset. I don't know how far you are from that Center so scary makes everything positive, which is nice.  Now this is sort of averaging all those distances.  now you probably might want to divide by n  but it turns out / n minus one is a better choice for very complicated reasons that have to do with bias of estimators that you can learn about later in life. But by / N - 1 you tend to get a better more faithful answer of what's going on most of the time.  Can you put the square root on because it was very foolish to square things cuz you change the units on the problem.  Now they're square units. So putting the square root brings it all back. So that's sort of the philosophical feeling behind all of this. We got to stop there.  I'll see you on Wednesday. Good luck with homework 1. "
