    "Full Transcript": "Okay, welcome back another beautiful day in paradise another beautiful day to learn more statistics.  So first thing we have to do is return to confidence intervals and make you feel a little better about what's going on.  You have a call that a lot was going on. So here's a beginning of the review of what we did yesterday or starting Monday Friday. Whatever is going on in life.  So we had some population.  It's huge and if something you want to measure about it called new maybe it's the average average weight of American say now you can't ask every single one sample that sample was his little blue dots it's little blue circles and you get to decide how big the sample is based on your money and resources. That's probably okay. Now in that sample, you could figure out the average there that sex bar and you can figure out how spread out it was that was that subjects we have these Latin letters.  And it'd be nice if you could just hand that X bar over to your boss or whoever wanted this.  And say that new but the problem is it ain't going to be Mew because there's variation in samples. So sometimes X bar will be a little above Mew. Sometimes. It'll be below.  And so in order to understand if you're a little green. Your little value for x bar was any good. We had to say what happens what are all the things that could ever happen?  What is we need to understand what's called the sampling distribution. What does it look like if you do lots of samples over and over and for every single one of them you found xbar and we discovered that those sampling values from you. That is all different X bars formed a normal distribution here in green.  Okay, and it turns out that that's true regardless of what the blue curve is up in the clouds that you never get to see anyway.  That's super helpful.  If it matters with a blue curb was then you have a problem cuz in the green curve my change.  Okay, so then we decided to set up an idea known as a confidence interval. So wherever we are as a green. We were going to reach her arms out.  And it would be sort of padding or estimate in recognizing this variability and we just started thinking about how much you have to pad things now. I wanted to show you this.  splitter way of doing this  so some students at Brown created this  can I still up here in the yellow is the original distribution? Who knows it could look like all sorts of things. Right? So I'll just set it to something like that.  And then you can say let's Ross sample and try to figure out the average of that Universe up there and let's put 11 people in the sample. Okay, draw the sample 11 people fall down. You take their average.  They don't know this is where it all stops. Your just one green. They're here. It's a little orange bar. And that's the best you could do. But you could imagine drawing a sample again. In fact, you could draw a lots of samples. Every single one gives rise to a value for x bar and all these X bars together have some histogram that represents them.  Now if you did this many many times over and over eventually you create the sampling distribution and this is supposed to be normal. Right? Well, how about I run it a couple hundred times and you start to see the normality appearing all we got a crazy one way over there on the right.  Clearly they round interesting.  Okay, if you want to see what the perfect theoretical curve is, there. It is a normal distribution. That's the sampling distribution.  You like shiny things. There's the shiny version of the STD software.  Okay.  So what are you do?  So what now? You know, what a sampling distribution is. Now, you see the variability that can happen in two different X bars and you realize you're one of them. Okay, so then we decided.  Oh my goodness.  I will come Crashing Down.  That was interesting.  Okay, so then you start worrying about what how much am I going to pad my answer by?  And you go back to the sampling distribution, and he said you know it if I'm at the center and I reach out to standard errors. I grabbed almost all the dots 95% of them.  Cuz that's a smart amount to reach your arms out.  If you're standing up Mew, he's got a good chance of getting those sample means. Okay conversely. We said, you know, what if we just stand in each of the green dots and reach out that same amount. Well 95% of the time you will be within your grasp.  Okay, so then we thought I would have created a picture. This would have represented us doing that for all those different sample me now. Some of them the green ones are the ones that actually grab Mew and it's inside there which is what you do when you can see you in about to your boss. You're both sitting there hoping I really want you to be in there. Otherwise, I'll looks a fool if it's not but every once in awhile, you'll hand over a bad interval but your boss expects that cuz you are just reading 95% confidence intervals 95% of the universe you hand over during your lifetime will be good ones and 5%  And then we said what what is this mean? What's the phrase confidence about? It's about the percentage of the time that the intervals in this big list will capture Mew now. You're always just one of them and you never know if your red or green, but you come from a process that is designed to be good.  And that's the best you can do in life.  Try to be good everyday and some percent of the time you're going to be evil or naughty or bad or whatever word. But you set some sort of goals for yourself in terms of how you're going to behave.  Okay, so let's try another example so you can see the start to finish and it will make you feel a little better.  You're curious how many Facebook friends your friends have?  Are you friends with popular people?  Is another way of asking this question you draw a random sample of 30. You have 30 Facebook friends.  It's only works. If you have at least 30 Facebook friends, but I imagine most people do okay, you go to their Facebook pages and you go find out how many friends they have.  Can you look this up on some friend count?  You can an average of 325 with a standard deviation of 25 and plug it all into our to get those calculations building 80% confidence interval for the following idea have this idea that you're building the interval for should feel like a parameter. That is a number that summarizes an entire population that you're trying to study for. The population is all your Facebook friends. Now you could go to every single one is a case where you can completely explore the population, but I'm guessing you don't want to do that cuz you have lots of friends, right who has time for this. So you'll just look at these 30 that's good enough. So here's the parameter idea the average.  friend count of all of your Facebook friends  Now if you want to build this interval 80% confident, the first thing I have to do is think back to that green distribution.  And you need to use it to find with Cody star the critical value. So if you on this distribution, you would want to imagine that you're standing right at the center and you're going to reach out and grab 80% of the green dots. I want to figure out how far you have to reach to grab 80% of the green dots.  The easiest way to answer this question is not on the green sampling distribution. It's actually on the standard normal.  Where the standard deviation is one?  Because if you go out and reach out the distance one on the standard normal when you go back up to the green curve, that's the same as one standard deviation on whatever that curve is.  So it's always a standard normal that helps you so you put a little picture here and you put .8 there and then you label the remaining sides.  and then you go to either a table or are and you say let's go figure out what sea star is now does he star in this picture is going to be this place right here in the horizontal axis or the red meets the white  Message distance you want to reach out over here will be negative sea star.  Okay, cuz you're standing here at zero.  Cuz one of the standard normal right now. Okay. Now I do kyun on point nine. The reason is to Norm is designed to accumulate area starting a negative Infinity. So you need to first get through the point 1 but you don't even care about and then you need to get through the point 8, would you actually do care about?  And it will spit out this place right here at 1.28.  So that number includes what the point 1 and 2.8 but it's okay because it's designed in such a way that it will answer the question about the point 8.  Along the way. Okay. So that's z-star. Let's go the critical value. Now. This is a Distance on the standard normal or if you lift it back up to the sampling distribution. It's the number of standard deviations. You have to reach out.  So what's Bill the interval now? I didn't give this formula explicitly yesterday because I wanted us to think about this for a while without formulas floating everywhere. So here's the formula for a confidence interval how you do take your best guess X bar that's from your sample. And you add and subtract a certain amount of each.  Now that beach will be dictated by the critical value Z star and the spread out and it's of the sampling distribution. That's the standard error which again is just the standard of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.  Now, unfortunately, that's formula requires you to know Sigma which you never know.  In real life. This is an impossibility because it's a parameter and in order to know that you have to know the entire population. And as long as the whole population you can go calculate Mew yourself.  Which is what we're looking for right now. So what you usually do as you approximated with what's going on in your sample. Now this little step here with that approximate sign is going to create a lot of mess later in this class some of your T distributions and all the stuff will get there. But for now  We're going to stay in our pretty little Universe of a normal curve. Okay, and now you just as we got 325 in our sample.  Will giving the standard deviation of 25.  And you can see me using a pretty good approximation here busy star. I went to a bunch of decimal places just so it'd be fun.  And here's the interval you're going to hand to your boss or whoever asked you this question and cared about in the first place. Now the way it's designed it's designed to be wide enough.  So that if you did do this study over and over and you generated lots and lots of intervals 80% of those would actually have new inside of them.  20% of the time. Whoops  What is the trade-off if you wanted to capture Mew with more certainty in life, then you have to reach out a bigger distance and then your interval is wider and less helpful to think about.  Okay, so that's the trade-off and finally you can report this in English. We are 80% confident that the parameter were trying to study is in our particular interval, but that means is our interval is one of an infinite family of intervals created using a certain process. Most of those are going to be good in capture, Mew and ours is one of the process.  It doesn't mean using R interval. It doesn't mean it's not.  Wow, 322 332 pretty tight little interval.  You got a pretty good idea of where Mew is assuming Mew is in the interval, which it may not be what's bothering you.  Why wouldn't it be cute - 2.1 normal .9 gives that value to Norm of one gives this place right here. So we need to pack them you're getting this horizontal distance. That's not what you want to do. You want to know the distance?  from zero out there, basically  I met end this qanon basically gives that because subtracting zero doesn't do anything.  So the hardest thing right here, you'll notice is this this critical score and the reason it's hard is because there's so much going on you have to say what I need to reach my arms out on that green thing. Well, let's instead reach out on the standard normal day. That's what's pictured here.  And then the trouble is you're reaching out if you want to grab a bunch of stuff, but you got to include the stupid point one cuz how tables are set up in life. And then the table gives you that value and that value becomes the number of standard errors right there. When you lift back up to the green curve. It's just incredibly complicated.  Now in time you do enough of these that you just become sort of a machine.  And a lot of this slick conceptual stuff sort of goes away which is both good and bad. So here's our anatomy of a confidence interval whenever you build one of these your best guess is at the middle then you padded it in the exact amount you patted by is  An attempt to grab a certain number of those green dots that form you or vice versa. If you had a green. You want to grab Mew with a certain certainty because this distance of one arm is going to be called the margin of error.  They will have a different definition in later classes if you take a lot more statistics, but that's what it is right here. Okay, so there's a margin of error of each way. So the width of these is always to margins of error or margin of Errors, depending on how you like pluralizing weird compound phrases.  And you can never forget your interval.  It's value, isn't it? It comes from a process of generating intervals and that's process is designed to work most of the time. You never know. If yours is good or not.  Now over the years you're going to start pretending that yours is good. You're going to start thinking in your soul. Here's my interval. It's in there, but you always have to remember you could be wrong. You make a 95% confidence interval of 5% of the time. You'll be wrong in that emotion believing the music in your interval.  I was cool as you can use these to do with cold hypothesis testing. So sometimes in life.  You have to make a binary.  decision  Now I'm spending most of my life trying to get away from all binary decisions.  but for example  The current legal system. The person is either guilty or innocent, right? We don't report back a percentage of guilt that is believed by the jury. Although one could imagine such a system. So while we currently have binaries in life, I think their ways to get rid of all of them. So hypothesis testing is a infrastructure to help make a binary decision and  Best statistical way possible so personally need a hypothesis. This is something that you think might be true some claim. You don't know if it's true or false people will think differently and it's always about population parameters. You don't need to make claims about statistics. The statistics are based on a data set and you have all the data.  Okay, the thing you don't know about is the population parameters. So here's an example is the average weight of all your friends the same or different from the average weight of Americans.  Guys, so you can claim hear that it's different. This would mean that you would be excited about them weighing more or weighing less. You just think they're on American when it comes to average weight.  Here's one about drugs.  You have this new drug exposed to increase happiness of people. So you might believe it the happiness increase experience from the drug and better than a placebo.  Doesn't mean it's true. That means false. Just something you're putting out their claim. They can be verified.  Here's the trouble.  with using data from a sample to decide  about population parameters  So here's a little setup, you know that the happiness increase from a placebo is 1.9 on some scale. Okay, who knows what the scale is somehow, let's just say you knew that if everyone in the world a placebo.  Okay, you decide to give some patients for drug and you find in your samples knows I'm using Latin letters that happiness increase was 2.3.  I'm feeling good about this. Are you?  The only trouble is you know that there's variability when you draw samples. So this particular sample of screaming 2.3 + that looks bigger than 1.9. But if I do a different sample, what if I have gotten 1.8 then suddenly your emotional complexes near the different way, right? So somehow we're gonna have to deal with the fact that there is variation in samples and yet we need to make claims about population parameters to say anything interesting in life.  And this is what hypothesis testing is going to do. How do you decide if something you see from one particular sample is strong enough in terms of evidence to start believing your claim about the population parameter.  That's a tricky thing.  Sample variation or true effect. So hypothesis testing is going to allow us to sort of statistically make a decision on what what we're looking at do we think it's the rule sort of the truth or is it just some weird anomaly?  So here the steps first hypothesis. This is about population parameters and it's a statement that basically says nothing interesting is going on in whatever I'm studying.  Travis is going to be an equal sign when you write these down. So here's some examples exactly like the pussy bow or if your IQ is the number 110 all these things would be super boring to me. I wouldn't get excited. You do research about things cuz you're excited about something interesting and this would be a sort of the status quo.  Don't they all use population parameters? Sometimes you can have the thing you care about equaling a number? Sometimes there could be two different populations going on.  Okay, they each have a mean in them. So we're going to focus first on this easier case where the we only have one population going on. So we only have one parameter called new and then we're going to set it equal to some number or some like comparison value or boring value. That's where it starts in the easiest paste.  Next thing you want to do is write down the alternative hypothesis. This is what you were secretly in your soul. Hoping is true or would be super exciting to you if you figured it out.  Now there's lots of ways to write these down there again going to involve population parameters. You could have a not equal to sign.  My friends are on American.  Try sometimes there's a direction for the sign that you are excited about. Okay, you're probably not excited. If your drug does not increase happiness as much as a placebo.  But it is worse. It makes people less happy than giving them the sugar pill now you might be able to find a way to Market that and later get excited about it.  That's a little black mirror. Just watch Black Mirror.  the best show on Netflix and everyone says that but  My date is the true fact. It's not random noise.  Okay, so there's a difference between you two obviously, right? The first one is going to be called a two-sided alternative because you would be excited if your friends were on the left side of American.  Less weighty or you'd be excited if they were on the other side the right side and weighed more than the average American. I don't know why you're excited about this. But either would excite you. Okay, this other ones cuz a one-sided one-sided alternative as well as reside there greater than sign or less than sign to set it Alternatives always use the not equal to symbol.  Which one you use your one-sided versus two-sided. It's just depending on what you care about. What's it? So you have to look in the problem and there are lots of examples where?  You know, you only care about one side of something you want, you know, you want to make something that makes people smarter or decreases their cholesterol or you know, whatever.  That which of those two steps is easy thing. You have to decide between the two hypotheses and this is where real life comes into play.  Hey, you do this all day, even though you don't realize you have the infrastructure in your brain. Okay, so first thing.  How do you make a decision in real life? Well, you currently hold some belief in your soul.  I should be a CS major some people in this room currently have this belief, right?  So then what happens so then some data collected? This is like the sample.  And the sample said something. Okay. So here, you know, you take your CSE whatever.  You're sitting at horrible Java class that destroys everybody.  Okay, maybe take electrical engineering class. Maybe it's not even about to go see if you have emotional feelings about these.  Okay. Now this data either supports what you were thinking here or it contradicts it. So if it supported you continue to believe what you've been believing you don't alter your course, right?  But if the data if that's your C Class broke your soul.  Then you like maybe this isn't for me or if you just love that electrical engineering class. So then what are you doing?  If the data suggest a movement or the alternative you just start believing something different.  You have never proven in this process it something is or isn't the right answer.  And in science believe it or not. You never proved that things are actually true and false only the universe knows that.  But what the process does is it triangulate you?  Ward the truth  a truth that best resonates with the data that are flowing into you.  Everyday you watch your friends make decisions and their loyalty to you.  And you start triangulating toward how you feel about them based on decision after decision.  But you never know the complete picture right never is revealed. Only the universe knows that.  Okay, and then what happens? Well, you have a belief either you're back at the original or you're at a new one and then you go collect some more data and this all continues. It's a constant triangulation for the truth that harmonizes with the data that fly that flow into our souls everyday. That's what life is in terms of hypotheses.  And this makes up what's called the no hypothesis testing framework.  So you're going to assume something's true. Most people will assume the null hypothesis is true. Great place to start the reason you like to assume the Knolls true is because the null has an equal sign in it. It's setting this parameter of Interest supposedly equal to come value and then it's very easy to work with if you think the average IQ in the room is 110. Okay, and then I start sampling from you and suddenly you're all 1:30. Okay. It's easy to compare that against the 110 value, but it's not very smart to start and assume the alternative which says you're not one pain cuz that doesn't mean anything to me or you're bigger than 1/10. I have no idea. Okay, so then you talk to your data and you generate your stat.  Listen to data coming at you from the universe. And what we going to do is build a confidence interval and the confidence interval says you know what I really think this thing you're trying to study this population parameter mew I'm pretty sure it's in that interval.  This is the reasonable range for What music would be that you have a claim in your soul about what Miu is from the Knoll.  But here's that the data suggest is going on with Mew Mew is in that interval. That's great. You believe in this idea from you the confidence interval says here's what I think of you sort of and when those harmonize keep believing what you believe, but if  Mew is not in the center Bowl.  Cinebowl screaming the reasonable things to believe from you.  Enemy within the interval something is awry the date are trying to triangulate you toward a new truth and that new truth will be the alternative.  So we're going to say we reject H. Not in favor of h a.  That's what I say.  And over here I say let's keep the null hypothesis.  Now another course as you may have heard things like fail to reject the null and all this sort of like double negative nonsense. Okay, either keep it or you rejected in favor of the alternative that simple I don't need fancy language as long as we all recognize that whenever proving these things are true or false these Nolan Alternatives. We're just deciding what beliefs we want to sit with currently.  This is how your life actually works. You currently believe someone is your friend. You currently believe you should be on a certain track doesn't mean it's the true thing.  You'll never know if it's the true thing. You'll just live life in a way that's harmonious with your beliefs or not.  Okay, Jada never prove the null or alternative is true to visit the framework and now we're ready for step 3 of the null hypothesis testing framework. So what you need to do is and this is just that picture all over again. You got to assume the null is true. And what this does is it basically fix his what you think the universe should be giving you if I believe this is the average IQ in this room is 1:10. Okay. I have this mindset and when I start collecting data on gauging it against that mindset.  And when lots of 110 flow in I feel very good about that and win lots of 130 slow and I'm like wait. Okay, so believe in something  see if the data are coming in support you so let's try this was some actual numbers here average American weighs 182.5 seem believable.  You have to look Beyond yourself.  Have you seen America?  Some of you may not I don't know what Germany looks like. I've never been. Okay, you read this.  You decide you're going to go way 20 random people that your sample and when you do so you get 175 with some standard deviation is the average weight of all your friends different from the national average.  So let's set these up. So first of all and be super boring if our friends were just like Americans and we know how much Americans weigh 180 2.5. You see a parameter. You see an equal sign. That's what I know. Hypothesis should look like now hear the alternative you have to make a decision about the alternative hypothesis before you look at the data.  I don't know if you know how science works but usually make the hypothesis first and then you go collect the data when you do it the other way that's not science.  stats data science  I just thought that up.  So clever alternative just because I chose that okay. It's what was in all the slides before right, but you might have some theory that all your friends on average way more and then you have a one-sided alternative. So just depends on the setup.  I bought this E-Town now time to believe in something in life believe in the Knoll.  If a null is true your friends on average should weigh 180 2.5.  So when you start sampling from your friends and you start calculating the average in that sample.  You get a green. And if you did this a lot of times you get lots of green dots, right?  And those green dots would have to be centered at 182.5 cuz that's what you believe this what you think the universe is about to do to you.  Okay. Now when you cut the actual day that you'll be one of these Green Dots. I don't know which one we're figure that out in a second here. But this is what you think the universe is trying to spit at you.  Okay, so there's our sample mean 175 right side green. Right there.  I feel weird.  Could the universe centered at 182.5?  Spit out something that 175.  You say yes.  It's mathematically possible right now.  Is it so unlikely?  Picture like wait a second thing really shouldn't be centered at 182.5. Maybe it should be at like 178.  177  probably not centered at 190 C. The question is is it so weird?  Picture like that. I don't know. What is 182.5. That's what you want to sort out.  So let's build a confidence interval. You can start with a 95% confidence interval just cuz it's the gentlest thing.  And this will tell us the most reasonable values from you.  Given our data, so I'm taking X bar and when do plus or minus 1.96 times the standard error. That's how spread out the green universe is.  That's always Sigma over root n but here Sigma will approximate with the standard deviation.  okay, so when you go  Do this out you get one 68.86 to 181.14. These are the most reasonable values from you the average weight of all your friends.  Given what we saw the universe gave us data.  And you notice when 82.58 in there.  What's the matter?  It's puzzling. Well, it's so something going on, right?  One possibility is that our belief and 182.5 is a stupid belief.  The universe is trying to tell us what to believe in. It gives us tonight's interval of the most likely possibilities, right? Okay. So if it's not in there just stop believing in what you believe in reject a null hypothesis and move to the alternative.  It appears.  Friends average weight is Not The American Average.  Indeed these didn't even suggested might be lower.  But if we want to go test that hypothesis will need a new dataset.  Right now all we can do is accept the alternative hypothesis.  This works believe in something let the universe give you some data use the data to build the reasonable range of possibilities and then see if your belief is in that or not.  What's have you tried one?  Enough of me talking 35 minutes non-stop exhausting listening to me, right?  The Greeks maybe you've heard of the golden rectangle. It's a rectangle where the ratio of the length and the width is equal to this point 618 the golden ratio you may know.  Now one thing you might think about this is the Greeks discovered the aesthetic ideal.  but this is this ratio Point 618 just is the best-looking rectangle a human being can make  if you believe that.  Then you would think maybe some other cultures would stumble upon this to.  And they would start making things that have the same ratio.  Okay, so what are you do?  To explore this question. So did the Greeks discover the aesthetic standard that all societies will try and get it to overtime.  Or does the evidence of seeing this in current contemporary Society built in to save a Ferrari Dimensions, which also called the golden rectangle?  So here's what happens when people studied this they said the null hypothesis would be that point. 618 is some standard. Okay, and I should see it basically all over the place if that's the case.  To researchers went to the Shoshoni Indians who so these beaded rectangle things.  And they started measuring the length and width in this particular society.  and for each of these to get with call the aspect ratio just take the width divided by the legs and then average federally aspect ratios, and you get points 661  with some standard deviation  construct a 95% CI for the true WL ratio of all beaded rectangles the Shoney's could ever make  Look beyond the 20 that we looked at.  And decide how you feel about the null and alternative hypotheses given these data.  Man, obviously are numbers not point six one eight, right?  But it's so far away that point six one eight becomes unbelievable.  Let's see how you do.  Is an actual study that happened in a research Journal.  Anthropologie, I think  Okay, if you just like stuff into a formula, right? Okay. See you at the Centerville point 62.702.  That's the best guess.  For the average of all beaded rectangles by the Shoshoni.  3 aspect ratio and point six one eight ain't in the interval is it?  So I'm guessing we should move to the alternative which is to say this isn't some aesthetic standard.  People disagree about what the perfect looking rectangle is because different societies come to different aspect ratios.  And when you see lots of points 618 all over Society, it's just people copying. The Greeks is all that's going on here High prevalence of Point 618 and Society is a historical tradition.  Nothing wrong with that.  Okay, so we do another one.  This is real data. You can go to the source. If you don't believe what you're about to hear 2015 happiness research group. This is actually a research arm that exists in this country and World 548 people just like you for as to give up Facebook a week. No Facebook shut it down.  And then to score their happiness on this one through ten point instrument for yourself. So they reported an average of 8.12 pretty good. People are happy, aren't they?  Who knows with the averages? Okay some standard deviation.  Now if you ask people who actually use Facebook and are currently using it to square them self. You asked everybody on Facebook to use this instrument you get this number 7.75.  Define variables and hypotheses and use a 99% CI to decide between your hypotheses.  now  Someone tell me what would be super boring?  Based on This research study and what sort of going on in it?  Go ahead.  Giving up Facebook has no effect on happiness Bellevue super boring, right?  Good, so that was actually there no hypothesis.  And the alternative you should decide before you actually look at the data.  Cuz I'm going to let you go for a while the first thing you want to do. Always Define the parameter. Do you think is super important actually being studied in this problem?  Once you have bad in place, then you write your hypothesis, then you go. So it's his opening steps that I'm intentionally leaving vague and forcing you to think about  So I'm going to go around and look for Greek letters.  No one yet has correctly written what Miu is on their page.  Okay, maybe you need to back up first. Think about what is the population that you were super curious about?  Can anyone tell me what the population is about which we are curious?  people that give up Facebook  Facebook users to give up Facebook. I guess you can't give something up if you didn't have it.  No.  I'll give up cocaine. I'm not using it.  Maybe that's not good. Anyhow, yes, we care about Facebook users that are going to give it up. That's the population were trying to study. What are we trying to study about them? That's what meter is.  the average happiness of  Facebook users to give up Facebook the first thing letting you be the average happiness of Facebook users that are forced to give up Facebook for one week.  There's a very precise Declaration of things in 2015.  Oh my goodness. Quit Facebook for a week. Great news up to now the reason you do this first is because now you can use this in the Nolan alternative hypotheses. Okay, we got a bunch of words and a lot of you with all those words all over the page. It's much more helpful to just write it with the parameters.  It will be boring as if their happiness were the same as the people currently on Facebook, which is its own population.  And we already know that population is 27.75 average happiness.  No ice at the alternative is two-sided here because before you begin collecting the data.  You might be excited about either thing. You might be able to argue reasonably.  The average happiness would go down a how I lost my favorite thing ever or they will go up that blood sucking leeches off of my life.  You could argue both ways, right and the question is which logic reign supreme it's all the scale  You can always argue for both sides of something. It's just one side is not as strong as the other.  Okay. Now what are you do if you want 99% happiness, or is it 99% confidence?  You could draw me a pretty little picture.  You could put the .99 in the center of the picture.  Once you put the .99 in the center there stuff left over on the edges .005 on the left .005 on the right Z star is this place right here? If you want to find that place you got to go through all that .005 you don't care about then through the point nine nine what you do care about to find out location, and here's me doing it using one line of code in our can also go look this up on some table using the same strategy for this disease for the critical value, and now you just break out the confidence interval and feel everything again, so hopefully you got the interval 7.999 to 8.241.  Those are the most reasonable values to believe in from you if you give up Facebook if everyone on Facebook gave it up for one week and we asked everyone and took their average our best guess of where the new movie is in this Zone. And guess what?  7.75 in in there, so we're going to reject the null.  in favor of the alternative  this is actual data. Look how much happier people are when they leave Facebook point. They go from 7.75 up to 8.12.  Every single study I have ever seen about Facebook.  And these range from small things with 500 people to almost all of Italy with Millions show the Facebook decreases happiness and almost all social media decreases happiness. This is why I no longer am on social media. I don't think that I'm any better than the average person and that's the average experience. So consider this as you move forward, let's talk after class.
