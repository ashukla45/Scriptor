    "Full Transcript": "Okay, we're back.  Sorry for being late. So we got so excited and office hours talking about probability theory that lose track of time, you know.  Just too exciting and I didn't eat lunch again today. So it's just been a big fail today for me. But anyhow, we move forward in life, right?  So what's up with the simple question here DMV? You've been there probably.  You go to the teller there are there in a good bad mode.  10% of the time you get that good mood, and you're served in 2 minutes?  80% of the 90% of the time they're in the bad mood and it takes 8 minutes for you to be served. How long do you expect the transaction to take?  Go ahead.  You said 8 minutes? Why could you get bad luck at the DMV?  Louder, please.  OKC said it's either 2 or 8 and 8 happens more of the time. Okay, so you're just choosing the thing that's more likely to occur and get a different than an average idea. You're choosing a mode idea the most occurring idea. So if I ask what's going to happen on average would you need to do?  Is take each of these ideas to an eight and try to wait them by How likely they are so normally wouldn't do an average and you take like X and Y and Adam / two-year waiting things equally it's got 50% of what was going on. So hear what we're going to do is move Beyond a simple average and move beyond the most frequently occurring thing and do a weighted average. So take to which will experience 10% of the time and take 8 which will experience 90% of the time and that weighted-average comes out to be 7.4.  Now one thing is awkward for people about this is you can never actually wait 7.4. But that's okay. I'm asking for some add which thing that may not be your individual experience.  So what we just done is actually create something called a random variable. And this is the most important idea after you learn probability Theory. So anytime you have a random event. It can result in different outcomes. Right? I could be heads and tails. It could be how many dollars you win in the lottery, but there's some list of these right?  Now they may not be equally likely. Okay, when I go to tee off my Branch here looks like hole in one and not hole-in-one. Those are the two possible outcomes.  They're not equally likely now a random variable is just a letter that hides those different possible outcomes.  You've seen variables in math before hold values. Now this one just hold values.  but it doesn't in a probabilistic way when I say x squared equals 4, you can tell me that X holds the values 2 + -2  but there's no probabilistic thing behind how often they should show up. It just are so now we're creating a sort of curtain behind virtual hide values with different probabilities of occurring. So random variable is a variable that takes on a list of possible numeric values is always numbers from here on out.  The results of a random event so you're not going to a random variable to talk about whether a coin comes up heads or tails cuz those are numbers you can code them is one and zero rate now. It's a random variable.  And they're two different kinds we're going to start with discrete random variables. These are random variables with a list of things. The variable can take on is are there finite as in the picture were there in case or you allowed to be infinite but you put spaces between the possible values that it can occur. For example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to Infinity that's called discreet when they're space between things.  You could do 0 1/2 1 1 and 1/2 to 2 and 1/2. That's also discreet. You can have negative values. That's fine. Also, eventually we'll do something called a continuous random variable that can take on any value in the real numbers in interval. So smooth continuous collection of possible values, but discreet ones are easier to deal with which is why you start with them first.  So whenever you have this pretty little letter that's hiding a list of possible values. You can make a probability table or probability model and all it does is it says what are the things that can come out or what dies can this variable take on and How likely are they?  So here's our first example, let's go back to the DMV the table here is not very exciting. Okay, there aren't many possible outcomes 2 minutes or 8 minutes. Very contrived, right? You always start with some simple binary in life. When you're uncertain when you're when you're simple, I guess when you can't think about things in a nuanced way, it always starts as a binary binary in life.  One natural way to think is this is simplistic.  How do I think about it more complicated Lee?  I just asked my students in high school this question.  It was about a conception.  And people of this view like it has not occurred or has occurred and then that has to make decisions about how they feel about abortion. And I said, I will not let you think like that you have to draw me a graph of the amount of conception that has occurred over time. So take like a day before the event.  The making a baby event.  They start their most people will draw the graph of zero. There's no baby yet right and men take me through the next 10 months basically and draw me this graph.  And people's minds are just blown if they try to think about this and like some people will believe it's like a step function Deere zero one one one one one. I thought of thinking about a binary what would that even mean?  Anyhow, okay to write this all down at the outcomes and X is just hiding one of those two numbers either 2 or 8. You can go pretty little bar chart if you want and just show me the probability at the height of this if there's lots of different values you get that many bars.  That one thing you do as soon as you have a random variable is what we started this whole thing off with is asking what value do you expect on average from this thing? Sometimes X will sort of spit out the number to it you sometimes a good likes to spit out ate a lot more than the pixel 2.  Political the expected value in the way you figure this out for any random variable is doing the calculation. We just did just tell me the possible values you can come out and I'll wait them by How likely they are to come out so ain't is wonderful and it comes on 90% of the time to you're all so wonderful, but you only show up 10% of the time.  And what's hard for people with first is the expected value of a random variable is often a value that you can't obtain.  Okay.  You're wrong. It's part of the definition of what the expected value is. If you want the formula in general, you can say anytime you have a random variable. All you need to do is run a summation over all the possible values.  Take the value.  Either 2 or 8 in this example and X is probability. That's it.  And this is one reason why to find a discrete random variable first.  If there's a finite number of outcomes with some is finite.  If it's a discrete idea with spaces, but there's infinitely many then it's what's called countable for all you people who've taken 109 and you can use estimation when you have a countable number of things that are going to be added together.  Alas if it's uncountable the summation no longer helps you and we have a different symbol to deal with uncomfortable things in life. What's that?  integral  that'll come later. And with why you need a bunch of integration calculus is a prereq for this we go. Let's see if you can build your first probability model. You're going to play a stupid game of chance.  roll a die  Sometimes you get an even number immediately.  You pay your friend $4, so sorry.  Not good for you.  If you roll an odd number on that first roll, then you get to roll again.  and if your first and second rolls match  And that rare event you will get $72 from your friend.  And if they don't match what's $12 goes to your friend?  Very contrived game but has a clear set of rules. So I said X is the random variable. It says how much money is going to exchange hands you do this in different days and different values that the random part of it and the variable is its hiding some value.  So draw me a probability table for this with these three columns outcome event probability. Good luck.  So all you people out there think of the right answer one check if your probabilities actually all add up to 1.  Something's got to happen, right?  number two  does your list of the possible values only have positive numbers in it?  Rookie mistakes, we make them now.  So here are the possible outcomes, you can use negative values to suggest money is going away from you towards someone else and positive coming into you. If you make them all positive, you're not distinguishing which direction the money is Flowing what you need to do to make things make sense here the possible descriptions of the events even roulade then match oven don't match. We have 1/2 that's the easiest want to do.  And if you're going to vinod roll and then you're going to match.  First you have to get the oddness to occur. That's 1/2 and then whatever number you roll. There's the one in six chance that you'll get it again. If you roll a three you got to roll with me again. There's no other option. Now these have to add up to one. That's one way to find the last thing the other is to just think about it first make the odd event happen and then after that to all done get a mismatch or five numbers that would mismatch and not line up. So make sure these other one and also think about pluses and minuses in life.  Your turn should you play this game?  I'll let you think about this for a sec do some calculations.  Okay, someone tell me if you were going to play this game or not. Go ahead. Why not?  Louder, please.  Expected value is -6 Tuesday.  I don't know if other people got -6 did you care that it was 60 or negativity?  You said you got a negative 6?  Are you worried about the negative or the six?  Oh, you don't want to lose money in life.  Well, let's see if I get negative 6 I probably won't be going to the probability calculation of expected value. I just hope he's probably really X the value that is associated with and I get negative one.  Okay, so you got something negative.  Yeah, you missed something somewhere. Anyhow, it's is ever negative irrational actor?  The person who thinks only rational about making money.  We're not play this game. Now. There's your rational actors. Maybe you like the fun of games. So you're willing to lose the buck. But when you're answering questions about probability, then you should be a rational actor.  Now would you play the game if it were expected value 0?  Okay, the rational actor doesn't care if all they think about is money. I'm 15 moved also thinking about time. Now, you're spending time doing this and that's a waste of time. You won't do it. If you're also a factor in fun, then you have to think about time versus fun. Whatever spending time with your friends.  Okay, but people are mostly irrational actors in life, which is like gambling exist in this world. It expected value of all things in all casinos is negative.  And yet there's entire billion dollar Industries around this.  That one way to think about expected value is just a weighted average of the possible outcomes. Another is in this is more natural for some people just imagine doing the game tons and tons and tons thousands of times. Can you get a big long list of your daily winnings and losses and they just can only take on these three values 72 -12 negative 4. So if you take the normal average the normal average of that big list of numbers, you will get negative one approximately and the reason you just have to take a normal average is because things are already waiting if something is bound to happen a lot you'll see it a lot in the dataset. So the waiting has been built into how many times things up here in the dataset. That's another way of thinking about expected value normal averages of a big huge data set of the possibilities.  Okay, so either it's just a long-run average if you do something at end of times.  As we just saw on the last slide, so sometimes people will write Evac singer with the letter M you which will stand for averages in this class.  It's just a weighted average or a long-term average of some random variable.  Who is our first example of something called? A parameter parameter is just a number that summarizes some big complicated phenomenon.  That's it. So here's just summarizing on average which you're going to win or lose.  Now there are other kinds of parameters you might study for a random variable.  1 is how spread out the values are that you experienced?  Play most people won't play games where you win or lose a stent every time but they get much more excited if you win or lose a million dollars every time you play and it's the spread and they love the feel. So this game 72 negative for -12 maybe that's spread out enough that you get excited and that 72 hits. I don't know.  So I spread how we're going to Define it to tell us roughly the range of experience. We can have that the random variable spits out things and we play the game every day with our friend now, they're different ways to Define spread. We're going to start with something called the variance. It is been nicer and cleaner formulaically of the two.  So this should remind you a little of some standard deviation ideas. So the symbol people use for variance is Sigma squared which suggests eventually in the future. We might take the square root of this idea.  And then we'll have a nice symbol called Sigma for whatever that thing is that we create. That's why it has a square on it.  Now, what are you do you run through all the possible X values and you say hey how far are you away from the expected value Mew the center of this experience?  And I'm going to square that to make a positive value cuz I only don't care if you're to the left or to the right. It's all excitement to me.  Then you're going to wait at the How likely it is to occur. If something is very unlikely to occur and its really really far away from the average.  It just never shows up in my life. Yeah, maybe a little so will include it in the sum, but it's a weighted deviation squared from the average experience. That's how I think about this guy. So this is just something nice. This is never a fun calculation. Not today not 20 years from now when I do these in my textbooks that I work through. Okay, so here is our model from before. So let me show you how the calculation of variance goes you have to first calculate the expected value. See if you do a calculation before beginning this calculation.  Take each value subtract away the expected value squared to make a positive and multiply it by How likely it is to show up in your life.  Adam altogether big math, get out your calculator simplify some stuff. Skip all this in between and you get 499  the important thing here is  a unit UCI Britain dollars squared  Now the reason is happens is because of that squaring action in the middle of the calculation. Okay, this -4 is in dollars the average experience in dollars subtract them dollars square at Dollar squared.  That one nice thing about this is the expression usually get is cleaner than the other things were going to do in life and all the mathematical formulas that are going to happen in a little bit or nicer when you use the variance. So that's why for those Pros the con is the units on the answer of the square of the units going on. So it is difficult to interpret  my experience with $499 squared relative to the spread out as to what's going on. I've no idea what that means.  Okay, but there you go.  Some people are so bothered by the units being swear that they then decide. Maybe I'll just take the square root of that and that's called the standard deviation.  Put a square root on a weighted average of deviations from the mean that is pretty square root of the variance and we can call it off and when you do this not only do spray with the number that you got out of variance be square with the units and you get yourself back the original units. So an average I'm going to lose $2 that's expected value and how wildly my experience varies that I'm losing that dollar.  Is about 22.34 so I could experience some things up in the positives -1 + 22 is positive I could also if I go down a standard deviation experienced a bad negative things.  You're probably not going to play the game if the standard deviation was super super tiny. Okay, you're basically always losing a dollar. Sometimes you lose 99 Cents. Sometimes you was a dollar 01. It's not very fun to play that kind of game. So the standard deviation gives you a sense of the variation in your experience as you do something a lot and the expected value is when you leave at the end of the day, what's it looking like basically for every time you played?  You should have average all years together.  Some people like to think spread not as has spread out is but how tightly you hold to the mean of the experience we can think about both of those. So it's small standard deviation be a very close hug of the mean.  So that is the beginning of random variable you learn what one is you learn how to find expected value variance and standard deviation life is more complicated than just a random variable. So we're going to consider all the crazy things that could happen. So no more of this nasty game nasty. Cuz all you do is lose money. So your friend says, you know what every time you want to play this game with me the first thing. Imma do is throw $3 in your face.  Then we'll play the game.  What is the expected value of the new game anyone?  red toolbox how to get to two bucks  guaranteed Louis know this is a random events. I'm going to win 72 every time I'm expected to lose but guaranteed to get 3 every time I play an expected to lose to so guaranteed less than expected is an expected you say  So here's what just happened. We just created a new random variable 3 plus tax. So this little cookie right here. You should imagine it is flashing negative for -12 or 72.  The tide what to do based on How likely they are to come up? Okay. So the expected value of 3 + x to the parent lie to Bucks like you said now what you're inherently doing here is using a rule.  The expected value of x plus a constant is just the expected value of the very thing. Plus that constant that you don't need to do any expectation around.  And it turns out that's true. And in fact, you can do a plus or minus there and it just has a plus or minus of the constant. This is the first rule about expected values.  Concerta pull out their padded constant or subtracted constant now I miss case you're going to go play that game because two is positive last time I checked.  Otherwise that true  something for you to think about  Her question, what are the variance and standard deviation in the new version of the game?  Go ahead.  But they don't change.  If I take all the numbers I could have gotten in at 3 to them.  They're still spread out as they would see luckily my hands and nothing's happening. Right? These are the values.  None of that problem on homework to the standard deviation 3 4 6 7 1 2 4 5 and you're like, how do I get this weird set to look like one too for 5 to get that to look like 3 4 6 7 and hopefully in that moment, you're like it doesn't matter if I move all the numbers the same amount and it's that doesn't think he'll spread out it is doing that made this moment easier. I don't see the picture this little visualization. I'm not trying to be rectangles anymore. And I was just a little line segment X is the blue x + 3 is the red the red look just as spread out is a blue nose to me. So what this suggests formulaically is the variance of a random variable plus a constant 1 -  It's just the variance of the original thing as he told me adding and subtracting a constant does nothing.  This is hard for people you mean like I can just erase that see in the variance. Yes, that's exactly what you can do and intuition will tell you you can do that standard deviation as a measure of things and it is the same way and subtract all the consoles. You want a random variable has she is losing money.  Did you put a gender on the friend in your head?  I just put a gender on the friend. No, I didn't.  Your friend feels bad.  Where is it? Say he?  I don't see any friend.  Hello, are you assuming gender is constant?  Philly Philly  Does it matter what I'm going to lose no matter what I love this is so good your friend bonus instead. She decides to double all the outcome.  Losing $4 is oozing 8 winning 72 is 144. This sounds very sexy.  What are Mews thickness word in Sigmund now?  Okay. So first thing you want to do is try to describe this new situation using some random variable expression.  And hopefully your intuition says 2x whatever value was supposed to flash out of that letter X what does double it and that's what x 2 does right?  Okay. So here's a new random variable expression that describes our game now all the probabilities underpinning these things are all the same. It's just be possible outcomes are now all twice as much.  So we just care about any of 2x tomorrow 2x in standard deviation of 2x. So, it'd be really nice if we knew some formulas on how to calculate those now in Math 180 a probability Theory you can go prove all these formulas, but we don't have time to do that here. So if you're super excited  You can take one of the a it's just a bunch of simple question doesn't really have much value. The intuition is much more valuable to apparently the expected value of doing something a times. It's just a tiny Speck of value doing it once  Okay, I maybe that seems reasonable.  Now here's where it gets messy the VAR of a x x turns out to be a squared x bar X.  They might be tempted to write a x 4x.  There's just one problem with that the variance which is the measure of how spread out stuff is should be a positive idea.  if they happen to be the number -1  if this were just an a you can create a negative variance.  So the squaring makes a little sense when you just think about plus and minus sign it also makes sense here on the standard deviation.  Okay, if you're going to double how far all the points are away from the origin and makes sense that you should just be doubling the spread out this pushing everything out by a factor of 2 now if a happens to be a negative negative for you got to make it positive so you don't have any negative standard deviations.  That could be a little weird in life.  So I'll show you the calculations in this case. Apparently, we're going to lose two bucks now.  Things believable the steaks are twice as high and we used to lose one buck.  Hey the variation that's where the variance is. Now this big 1996 Square dollars. That's another way to remember that there should be a square. Is that all the units going on or squared ideas, so  Helps you remember there's a square on the a weather makes any real sense or not a different question and here two times the old standard deviation. The experience is more. Wild Now by a factor of 2.  Your ups and downs, and if you want to experience the feel of standard deviation go sit at a five dollar blackjack table for a day and then the next day go sit at a $100 minimum table. Your emotions are going to be 20 times as crazy.  Trust me on that one and don't go. Anyway terrible idea. You're going to lose money you decide to play the underworld game.  So we're back to the original game that we started with.  You can do each weekday of which there are five and you're going to record your weekly earnings.  What value should you expect for the weekly earnings and how much variation are there in the weekly totals?  This is where it gets hard for people this moment and it's cuz probability Theory don't work like math.  So the first thing you might be tempted to write is the following.  But this problem cares about is taking 5 weekdays playing the game on each weekday and adding together the totals.  And so you might be tempted to write this.  You should never write something like this. This is way too dangerous because if you write something like this, what do you want to write next?  ibex  five acts as we just saw with two x is supposed to be quintupling outcomes.  And the question is are those really the same Well turns out they're not which we're going to see you in the moments in when it comes to random variables.  Adding apps to itself a bunch of times does not get 5X.  Now, let me show you what you should write.  It is safer to write except one the winnings on Monday plus except to all the way up to Exit 5. The reason this is safer is you are not going to come by and listen to 5x to save different subscripts.  Usually math when you write the letter X and you read it again.  Are the same value?  Sophia x + x it really is 2x but here each day is different. So the first X might spit out of -4 and the next X might spit out 72 the next ex will spit out something it wants to spit out. So ex while it visually looks the same on the page. You have to remember it's hiding a value that it holds in its toll.  And it could be different from each X teach other X. That's why you subscript them and then you're not tempted to do things.  Now if you wanted to find the expected value of this big hot mess x 1 3 x 5 added together fundamental you would need to know how to find the expected value of two different things added together and just repeat that process, right?  So here are the helpful formulas.  I know this is very formula heavy day.  You're so you find the expected value of two random variables being added or subtracted. Apparently, this is very nice. You just take the expected value of one expected value ever and Adam together.  Pictures of linearity property you seen this with integrals before you seen this with limits before you seen this with summations before?  And if you think about how things are defined the properties that going to eat at the XP of X. Sorry, it has the night properties that we need to have this Winnie everything pop out.  Now variances word becomes more complicated. First of all, there's no typos here. This side has a plus or minus sign in the right hand side just has a plus.  Apparently doesn't matter with you add a bunch of crazy random things together or subtract a bunch of crazy random things when you want to figure out how variable the total experience is. It's just the sum of the two variances the United States Britain If X and Y are independent random variables. We talked about independent events before  Weather one if one has occurred. It doesn't give you any idea about what's going on at the second event and How likely it is the same thing as true random variables if you know the ex is going to spit out a certain number.  It doesn't tell you anything about what wise going to do and do whatever it wants its unaffected by the value that comes out of the first random variable.  That's what independent random variables are finally the standard deviation. All you do is put a square root over all the variants stuff. The left hand side will turn into a standard deviation in the right hand side turns into a big,  and again, you need independent random variables for this to be true.  Do we say all those words? We didn't say number to this is kind of interesting expected value statement has no mention of dependent or independent random variables. It's always true and this is really a super powerful fact because if you have a bunch of random variables that he somehow all tied together with some hidden network of wires behind the screen.  You can still find expected value of their sum or their difference and you can signor all the wiring behind Queen is making them dependent on each other.  Now this bar fact I mentioned is just a plus sign if that were minus sign. It would be possible to get a negative number out of that difference, right?  Whoops can have a negative variance a measure of how spread out stuff is which is always a positive idea. So that's another way to know. This has to be a plus symbol.  32 layer all this intuition on top of the formulas life is so much better.  This is how I remember all these formulas.  Okay, so we're back to this your third game. If you play it one time, you're going to lose a dollar with this variant. So let's go play it five times.  So the expected value here, you can just add together use that rule a lot of times to break it up into lots of little pieces and every one of those has a negative one. So if you can do it everyday, you can lose $5 during the weekdays that make sense. You probably didn't need fancy formulas to tell you that in that intuition, right?  Now you do need the fancy for Moe's when you start getting to other things.  So now we're going to take about Burien. So the question is does what happens on Monday how much you win or lose affect what happens on Tuesday?  Do dice have a memory?  No, it's not a trick question. What determine how much money you get is determined by the dice, right and every rolls independent of every other wall. So that's how you know the values that you're making money rolls. So the variance of the sum of these five days, it's the sum of all five variances, which is just five times the variance of one of them.  Okay, and now we can do the standard deviation by just putting a square root on the variance thing. We just found that's easiest way to do this always calculate the variance first then use it to do standard deviations. You noticed all the facts on the previous slide. It was super important to us. They were really helpful this one right here. It was breaking up the variance. It was most valuable and you're going to use the most  and then if you want standard deviation just put a square root on things. So I always filter everything in life through the variance.  Now a second ago, we talked about x + x + x + x + x it's not easy expression, which is super prone to misinterpretation and should never be used.  If you wrote that and you wrote It's 5x you might say do I get the same answers?  Sew-in right here. I'm showing you what happens when you do the expected value of 5x. Okay, you can move the five outside and just do the expected value of x and you get negative 5 what's happens to lineup?  miracle  According to the bearings for my favorite constant a comes out of a squared.  * the variance of X different answer  and finally the standard deviation 1 also comes out to a different answer. So you have to be very careful. There's a very different 5 x + x 1 added 3 x 5 represent different ideas one in doing something five separate times and combining the results. That sucks 1 + 2 x 5 5 x represents doing it once and quintupling the damage in life.  Those are totally different games.  The reason they're different games is the following.  Why doesn't adding two things together just become 2x with random variables.  So take a look.  If you do 2x you're doubling all possible outcomes.  if you do x + x  the first X can take on one of the three values II X can take on 103 values and when you have them together, these are all the values.  So why do we get different standard deviations?  in these two scenarios  You get the same average?  We just on the last example. We got lucky, right?  And you always get lucky in fact.  Why do you get different standard deviations? Go ahead.  Maybe in a linear dependent way they are.  linear Independence  Let me help package that a little.  Here's what I sort of heard. I know all the math word you were using but they don't so let's try a little cleaning package.  When you just double things you can see we only have two possible values.  When you start adding up and each variable can be whatever it wants in life. You get those same three values along the diagonal here. That's when they both agree and they pick the same thing just by chance, but you also get other values.  And these other values are tempered their controlled. For example, you take a -4 and you had a 72 and you get this sort of Summer experience of 68.  And you can create lots of, experiences like -16 for example and 60 and those nice calm experiences don't exist over here in this crazy world.  So the positive stuff in the negative stuff combines to temper the kinds of values that are popping out and that creates a more data points more Central on the possibility chart, you know, it's not just 144 and negative whatever -24 you start seeing things in between which makes it less spread out than it was before. I had a bunch of crowd to the middle the middle get big and the spread out in this is not as big. So anyhow, you should never be using things that look like x + x you should never write that on your page is just too dangerous and no one does it at higher levels?  When you subscribe them, you're safe.  Yes.  Sorry can't hear you.  You're comparing playing five days in your total to displaying once or playing once Queen toppled.  Play One Day the possible values you can get out of that experience.  Are pretty small but when you start adding together five days suddenly you get big huge. You win all 5 days your way over here on the right. Yeah, so just takes the whole picture and pushes it out. Like there's lots of stuff in here in the middle of that God created it and do before but now it's pretty wide. Yeah.  The problem is they're not one event.  They are really five events package together in each of those five things can do whatever it wants in life.  It's too dangerous.  I mean I could put a single letter. I can let y be X1 + X2 + 3x 5 right now looks like one event but at its heart it's still this some of lots of individual cookies and the only way to figure out what's really going on with the complicated song is to know what's happening with the pieces and how they play together.  What do you mean by a continuous event?  What is 5 days straight mean? We just playing just as soon as the game is done a new one starts.  Okay, so it takes a fixed amount of time to play the game.  So then you just divide by 5 Days by how many things you can get in there and now you're playing at 117 days *  Yeah.  I know it's not a sexy answer. That's just how it is.  Oh my goodness.  Cheshire crab  Let's see if we can do one or two of these.  You're probably going to break the system.  Actually this fear of you now.  Maybe won't break the system.  Did you start studying for the exam yet?  It's a week from today.  Is first Uber good? Okay. So here's a game now.  Pull two balls without replacement from a bag with 3 green and 4 yellow.  Sometimes you pull colors that match and lose 15-20.  What's the best way to set up the random variable y that we're going to use in this problem.  Questions about set up are hard for people.  Questions about formula are easy for you guys. Now, you're good at formulas. You've done them for years, right?  Now you transition into graduate school. It's about setting things up. What's the matter?  Intex so much of life for you is going to become here's a horrible disaster situation figure out how to model and set it up.  That's the hard part and then the formulas I'll just push everything out. You care about in life.  Okay, let's see how he did.  Oh, so this is a big danger random variables. They should never be equal to probabilities. They are the results that can occur in each of those results will have a probability hidden behind it.  But never make random variables probability ideas. They will have them. Okay. We got to stop at 6. I'll see y'all later. "
