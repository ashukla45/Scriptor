    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  Hello.  sadly  We've come to the end. It's our last class together.  I know I miss you already.  Oh, we got a final exam.  Okay there Monday. I know one of the earliest slots 11:30 to 2:30. I'm hoping to start by 11:20 so I can give you 10 extra minutes cuz you want 10 extra minutes.  It took me about 35 minutes to write the solutions.  So you have roughly five or six times that much time and that's if you know what you're doing. If you was right everything then go that's how long it should take.  What do I expect the average grade to be you mean given that I've seen the exam and I've seen its difficulty.  well, the problem is  this answer doesn't exist in a vacuum if I say a number.  then that affects what people do  like I said 10% then was crazy starting and then it can't be 10% anymore. I say a hundred then no one started and then the average is lower than a hundred. So it's complicated to answer.  I don't know.  70  I think that the exam has some very routine very clear things and I think that the average on that kind of problem will be like 90 Inc exam has some tough things that require you to think and put pieces together.  And whenever you ask that kind of question, then the average is like a tasty. So it's a mixture of 90% kinds of things 8070 and 60 pound of things.  Yeah.  Earth-like both  What the average is almost identical?  I don't know. I may just depends like it's complicated you're acting like to specific questions and I don't actually do anything like what what is the information that actually make you do in life?  If I don't want to ask questions where the information is not worthwhile.  Okay. Anyhow, I can tell you some things that might be worthwhile if that's what you'd like to hear.  So for example  Next time will be here and I will show up at the right place.  The exam will be fairly equally balanced across all the quarters are all the week. Sorry.  So you can see that roughly equal emphasis on all 10 weeks. Now, you know, you shouldn't leave anything out. I can also tell you that the exam basically test almost every single idea that happen in the entire course.  I like to write exams like this.  Completely truly comprehensive and sometimes you have to put ideas together. Now that you see the whole picture you shouldn't think about statistics in this atomized way one atom here one atom here and they form compound.  And you should think about if you want a metaphor for Fitness. This is not going to be like you going to the gym and doing an arms day. We're just buys you do some tries.  And who cares about all those other muscle groups like a crossfit workout or if there's any weakness in any muscle group in the entire body, you will feel it.  Occasions like scary like I don't care about any of this in motion just like these Just Bats.  You know how people like if you know, everything will be represented. Well, guess what? We didn't have a homework on the last few things. You might want to make sure you've looked at those ideas thoroughly last time I taught the class we did have another homework assignment due on Friday of the last week. And so now you can go look at those problems and I prepare and make sure you're up on those ideas. For example.  Another thing that might help you shouldn't use the old exams as your preparation. I know a lot of people do this.  in fact, I did this a lot, but I did it when I knew the professor was one of those professors that like  talk about this idea put the same thing on the homework, but the same thing on the exam.  But with that kind of person is very nice. There's incredible consistency to everything and you never push to actually think about anyting. All you have to do is just memorize a certain kind of problem.  Is olive High School sounds like fifty percent of college, but if you know, that's not how court works, then don't study in that way or study 2002 problems understand everything procedurally conception intuitively when you're ready and your your Cheetos ready and you got to stop box next to you sit down and do an exam.  Timer set for real don't give yourself an hour and a half to think about a problem. Give yourself 12 minutes and see how you do.  anywho  authentic experiences that mimic will actually happen tend to be incredibly valuable believe it or not.  Okay.  Now another day might help you.  Exam is on Monday. So if you have questions, what do you do? Cuz there's this thing called the weekend.  There's a whole document put together.  I'm going to be coming in on Sunday for 3 hours. If you happen to be here on Sunday, I'll be in my normal office. Now, it will be difficult to get to me because they locked buildings and I can't unlock.  But I can pop open doors or you can wait for other people who are leaving the building to come help you you can call campus security and see what they say or feel like. I have to get in the Math building. I got questions about that.  It's Sunday doesn't work for you. I had the Tas choose a huge list of days.  The credit that are non-overlapping could help you here. So anyhow, there's lots of help available. You may have to break down the door to get to it.  Now that wasn't even funny, huh?  I ain't home.  So just some things through some things.  What's make you good?  Look up a little problem here and see how it goes.  Now you may notice these lights aren't on the interwebs. They will be after this class. But I wanted you to feel what it feels like when you don't have all the answers in front of you and you can't look them up and it's a real deal.  There's a level 1 difficulty out-of-state 5.  Good luck.  Okay, that's how long this kind of problems to take.  Are you done? Let's find out where things went. Well and when they went awry as they say.  First of all the problems about a one sample, which is one population right fish in Sunlake and t means I'm going to be using a t-distribution not a normal distribution and I want to build an interval. So if you want some clean Little Nugget, this is what we're about to do one sample T interval. Okay. So here's our formula take your best gas and Pat it. We're going to have to teach distribution to help us in the padding process. It will call when you're doing things with means. It's to 7-2 1-1. Sorry. It's the correct distribution.  So that's why we need to start to help us here. Now. How come we didn't use the normal distribution. The problem is about averages. We agreed that we would always use the T distribution for averages.  All you people that like maybe once upon a time use the normal distribution and maybe you said like what if the sample is big enough then it's okay to use the normal forget. All of this nonsense is just a total waste of time. If the problem is about averages. T distribution end of story that if your samples really big guess what the t-distribution turns into the normal distribution.  So you weren't so much about trying to transition to some other curve. Did it already transitions to yes.  Louder, please.  Good, so there was an asterisk on everything. I just said and it was what you just said, which is if the problem happens to be making a power calculation.  Or sample size calculation then you do go back to the normal. The reason is if you're trying to decide how big you want your study to be in figure out what n is an NSO known and if you're dealing with the T distribution, you noticed that which one you're on depends on end.  You can't simultaneously have it as an unknown and then try to use the T distribution which requires that information to be well-defined. That's why we go to the normal in that case. I feel okay.  Beautiful. Okay now go to some pretty table. Here's a random one-off the interwebs.  I need to look up piece of 32 + 33 - 1  and though it didn't have a 32 so I just went to some nearby place. What's not get worked up? It's fine. Okay, so here's 30 and if you want this particular confidence interval.  90% then there's a central 90% You care about 10% left in the two tails. So if you look over here to Tails together, they make up point one.  31.697  that's what you should have somewhere. If you start doing this with a z distribution and normal distribution some ta will be minus one happen you sorry.  Okay, it's not hard to remember means two proportion Z dumb discussion over.  Isn't that what I just said?  Z is normal  It's the standard normal distribution.  It's okay. You know how long it took me to realize is he is a normal distribution. It's a standard normal. Okay, good. Anyhow, here's your SOB formula standard deviation of a route in so I plug in your numbers to get some value. Okay, I probably went around and in all these middle steps like I'm probably doing right now, which is dirty just type it all in at once and you go get your interval. Hopefully it'll put an ice box around it like a professional student.  you laugh but  you can go look at the studies. Take the exact same student paper have a bunch of teachers graded.  Okay, then take the papers and put a box around the final answer and have a bunch of teachers grade. It totally different results.  Your goal is not just get things right but resent them in such a way that the person whose grading them will believe that you got it right boxing answers is a huge way to do that. Go ahead.  What does the red text say?  Let's go to Socrative.  I know it's just a crazy day. I say these things and then people like home.  Let's see how you do with misconceptions or conceptions around confidence intervals. We just built the 90% CI, right?  1 about 90% of the fish in the lake have a length.  In the confidence interval, we just found.  Okay, there's two thirds.  Good mostly false. The confidence interval is not about individual measurements, which is with this question is it's designed around the average idea going on. That's what he's trying to capture.  If you go from 90 to 95.  This thing must get bigger.  Uh, oh, we're down to 80%  so you can use the metaphor to help you remember?  You can also think about a picture of a t distribution.  When you go find T star your goals to put some amount of area inside. So here's 90% And what you're finding when you find T star has this value down here on the x-axis. If suddenly there needs to be more area and you did actually grab 95% You got to grab a little more than you were grabbing before which causes the to start a move to the right a little  . Then makes a padding amount bigger as you add and subtract 2 * * something.  Okay, we're down to 84% Can we get it lower?  If we took many samples about 90% of the sample means that we would calculate would fall in our interval.  We're down to 37%  Let me dry your pretty little picture.  This is a pretty little picture known as the sampling distribution. You might know it as a pretty little picture that shows the different values you can get for the thing called Xbox.  When you draw One sample, you get an average, but if you do a different sample, you get a slightly different average, right? Okay. So what just happened in this problem, so this is centered somewhere and we got some particular value in our problem like 4.4.  So what we do then we built a little interval around it. Right? So here's this confidence interval visually if you want it.  Now the question is if you kept drawing more samples and finding X bars would they live in that interval? Well, if you want to know which ones would live in the interval you could imagine drawing little lines up here and shaving that area. Those are the future X bars that will live in our interval.  That look like 90% to you.  Some random area so confidence intervals are not good at all making predictions about future ex bars.  Okay, double the sample size the width gets cut in half.  I saw that look that was like I know this and then you like why is he looking at me like that? Oh my God, maybe I forgot something. What did I mess up? That would just happen.  Yes.  Say I gave me that look because I knew you'd know but then I can make you doubt but now form the connection your brain even stronger and you learn to start trusting yourself and not looking at me.  Okay, probably saw a look at the formula. There's a square root on that end. So you need to quadruple Square returns for into which Cuts things in half if we took many samples and for everyone built a 90% confidence interval about 90% of those intervals would contain the average length of all the fish in the tank.  There's two thirds.  Okay. So this is what 90% confidence mean means there's a process that generates intervals. Usually that process is a good job. 90% of them will capture Mew which is what we care about every once in awhile 10% of time. It spits out of garbage in herbal. Now, we're just one interval. We never know if we're good or bad. That's okay. We came from a good place. So we'll just keep hoping we're good in life. Oh, no, don't do that.  We'll come back to it.  We need to do another problem.  One of the things are going to notice it's if you can't get started on a problem everything falls apart so we can have another problem where you focus on getting us started here. And then we're actually in a practice the bun getting started in life.  So here's a big block a text. Obviously don't copy it down. I want to show you how I read this as I read the problem.  As like a statistician looking at a problem.  Bunch of words. I don't care about bunch of people. Okay. So here's the sample as soon as I see that it's divided in some gender binary.  I would just taste in my mouth.  And then I say, oh we have our first categorical variable.  6 + gender / whatever were they used on the survey and probably don't even understand themselves answer the question about political views. This is the other variable being measured.  I wonder how they divided that up of the man blah blah blah liberal moderate conservative political orientation trinary. Probably a terrible way to measure how people actually believe about things but that's what the actual datasets o-okay of the women something something something numbers. Don't really matter right now.  Do the numbers provide strong evidence of an association?  When I see the word association is only two ways to study Association in math.  in statistics  if there's quantitative variables in your problem there studied one way if there's categorical variables to study two different way something something something run a hypothesis test. That's how I just read that. Good luck.  Square to buy.  Katy Perry  When you see the word association your brain should go one of two ways.  Either things were trying to determine or Associated are categorical variables.  like yourself a diet identified binary gender  and political orientation primary care about are quantitative numerical variables like weight and height.  If a categorical then you build a table and the categories are forming the columns and rows and you can use chi-square.  If you're studying numerical things like height and weight can't make a table cuz of values could be anything right and that's when you get a scatter plot of heights versus weights. And if there's an association there you looking at whether the slope of the regression line is 0 no association or something interesting is going on in your sugar is low.  chill in your brain when you see where Association  go one of two ways.  121 chi-squared you find expected counts.  Now this is where the room diverges all the people with fancy calculators and took AP Stat in high school or just going to start hitting buttons. I'm guessing your type in my little Matrix of data going to say run a chi-square test and will do everything for you, right?  A lot of people with not amazing calculators that on a graphing and then do all this in high school you and your choice you have to sit there and figure out all these fake accounts and guy and we do that to get some dignity numbers, right?  And then you're going to have to go calculate the chi-square statistic yourself.  Now I hate that disparity.  But basically just a money disparity, right so often I'll say You Must List the entire table of expected counts and explain to me how you would get a particular cell.  I can also say You must explicitly calculate the chi-square statistic yourself.  Using only simple buttons on your calculator like plus minus squaring Division and so on.  So you simply have to go through all the steps so you can't hide behind your calculator like some people do on the AP Stat exam.  If you're one of those people, you know exactly what I'm talking about right now. I don't know if any of you were but it's very easy to get a 5 on the AP Stat exam by hitting buttons on a calculator annoying nothing.  Great education that's going on there in our country.  So be prepared there's other ways I can bring everyone into alignment.  Maybe you'll see some of those on the exam.  Okay, so here's our expected counts or call those are going to be non integers as totally fine. But just theoretical expectations of things expected counts, and we want to go calculate the chi-square before we do that. We need to make sure those pesky conditions have been met.  When is the sampling distribution of what we're dealing with here really a Chi Squared so you better accounts which we do.  Expense account should be greater than or equal to 5. I can look at the expected count table and see that quickly and as you're feeling up the table with human beings and how they self identify. These human beings better not be all tied together with some weird tether cuz otherwise it forces something weird to happen. So if you look back at how they were built now, I finally would go read the words about the sample. I don't really care about them.  Until this moment recent college senior survey UCSD seniors, but all UCSD people ever and if you look at how was administered and you know about the college senior survey, they send an email to you when you graduate and say we'd love to have 30 more minutes of your time to call this horrible survey with hundreds of questions.  So you can imagine how that goes people hate that we're going to volunteer bias and back. You can tell something's awry when the women numbers for 77 in the Menace 208.  This again proves my point that women volunteer for things more than men but Italy UCSD graduating men and women follow this trend as well. So I'm a little worried about the independence of things because we volunteer bias but let's suppose we go ahead anyway and calculate our Chi Squared stat.  No, I will agree that this was a horrible calculation.  Sorry.  This is about the worst. I would ever ask you to do adding six numbers together. Now every time I make this choice to put something like that on there a disadvantage is all the simple calculator people simple calculators. It's very hard to type all this in at once and see it all and make sure it's correct. You have to do every little piece and keep doing it is very frustrating, right?  So this is a social justice issue right here putting one of those down but it's very hard to like equalize all playing fields. Unless you require people to buy expensive technology. And then that's a social justice problem, too. So, I don't know why you can't win in life.  I just don't know anymore. Okay, now we got 9.71.  I don't know if that's good or bad or anything. We've got to go drop that down on a distribution and then shade question again is which one if it's a two dimensional table the lecture notes suggested that you should go our - 1 * t - 1 where aren't you the number of rows?  If it were a one-dimensional table you probably remember number of bins - 1 a - 1 sound familiar.  Now you might wonder why that's true and I've never given you any intuition. So I suppose it's finally time for the intuition.  Let's say you're going to take a hundred people and force them into some quartet.  a possibilities the generalization of a trinary  Coronary, I don't know you have 200 people right? So if you think about what's possible, you can basically get almost anything you want in that box. Just however people from fall out, right and this box in this box. They can be free to be almost anything they want in life, but the last box can't why?  Is there an expected life at the following week?  close  Yeah, so if you can ask a hundred people the boxes have to add up to a hundred right? So if these three are allowed to be whatever they want in the light and life this last box has to be 100 minus the three check marks. So that's why in terms of the degree of Freedom parameter. You have three things or k - 1 that are allowed to be free when it comes to a table. It's a little more complicated. Oh my goodness.  So here's some table you can start filling up right? Let's hear asking a hundred people. So right down here is going to be a hundred and the total margins, right? So a lot of boxes can store to be whatever they want to be in life.  Then if there's some null hypothesis going on that says some things are independent.  That condition sort of puts restrictions on what's going on in the margins.  And once the margins are sort of restricted this box is not restricted because they have to add up to whatever the margin does. So this can't really be whatever it wants and neither can add another can all of these marginal things if you look at what's actually allowed to be free. Not are by Steve the things that are minus one by C minus one. It's a little complicated, but that's like the most intuition I can give you.  Okay. So here's our number 9.7. We're going to look it up on some distribution. We haven't used a chi-square table yet in the class. So I thought we'd see this so you can feel out that awkwardness.  Okay, so here I am in chi-squared sub too. And I'm looking for our number 9.7 and it's going to fall right between these last two ones.  And if I go up, it's like a t table I should see areas at the top OK and these areas of these little subscripts .01 in .005. So if I were to drop 9.7 down and I were to say to the right, my area would be somewhere between .01 and .005. So the exam will say You must either give an exact P value.  Fancy calculator people or you must give bounds on the p-value table people.  And then whatever that is, you got to compare that to the alpha. Now. I'm not going to give you an alpha that's in the middle of the Zone within the bounds. People don't know what to do.  P-values your head like you don't right. Okay.  So don't matter what is going on with her P value is less than .05 cuz it's already lost in .01. So we're going out to know and again to know for these is always that there's no association between the ideas on the axes. And if you like Independence, right that word the alternative is that there is an association you can use the word dependence.  Somehow gender and political orientation are linked.  Is that surprising?  If I tell you someone's mail and I tell you nothing else about them to have any feelings about their political orientation more than before. I told you they're binaries self-described in.  Or right-wing or right leaning more Republican.  The conservative I don't know what any of these.  Okay, and if I tell you someone self-identifies as female, you think they're more liberal? Okay, that is basically what this is showing in this population now doesn't mean it's like a super strong thing may be moved to like the tiny bit on the Spectrum. But this is showing the movement from one been to the other three lines the political affiliations somewhat.  Maybe even a ton we have to go look.  Let's see. If you're right. There's the pretty picture can the visual human Concepts pick it up quickly men or women.  Kaiser women in this sample work more liberal and moderate than the men where it's almost equal ish.  It's just it doesn't have that many conservatives.  I went and looked at the you like Twitter page. Whatever Mom that problem. Yeah, there was that many people.  At college campuses for U faculty is super super liberal. Can I go look that up in public records or whatever they did that recently was like 90% or something self-identify as I don't identify as any political affiliation anymore because I don't know what any of those words mean nothing seems to mean anything anymore. So I've given up labels post label.  Okay, so if you had trouble choosing chi-squared for that, you noticed that it shut down the whole problem. Right? So, let's practice the skill a little.  This is metacognition not actually going to run any tests here and do cognition on the page. You just went to decide what cognition to deploy which is the metacognitive go.  The first thing one sample to sample this reflects whether you're drawing a sample from one population, or maybe there's two populations and you join one from each.  sometimes when you drop into they got paired that's V option you see  now  this is a test and T Test all the Z test stuff is about proportions. So if your problem involves proportions you looking for these things.  And if it's about me and you looking for two things.  NFL counts looking for chi-square things  So take a read tell me what you think is most appropriate.  so all the people that shows a  This problem is not about proportions the way I know that is your measuring a quantitative variable pH level is a number idea proportions. Never.  Are related to numeric variables are related to categorical variables.  How many people fall in Ben I so counts and proportions?  Arlington categorical  I know it's probably illegal.  Should be hanging out. How do I read this problem? Blah, blah blah words average instantly know the problem will be something about teas.  Blah blah blah husband Baba by wife heteronormative problem gender binary upset, but now we're through population.  Are we going to use both the husband and the wife o which is in couples. So now it feels paired. So that's how you do the problem.  I'll try another.  Oh my goodness. You're so beautiful.  nutrition my hand  your dog loves The Taste of human flesh.  Come on back away there.  There's two thirds of the room.  Okay, how do I read this bunch of words don't care about support withdrawing troops. Oh, they're forcing me into a support not support binary. That's a categorical variable.  What do I think they're going to do with it?  determine whether at least half  well, maybe they're thinking about proportions.  if that's the case, then the answer is a  maybe they're going to use counts somehow.  So I'm not saying that f is wrong.  Just saying if you're going to say f then.  FNA would have to have some sort of connection where they either could be used.  I don't know if it's true or not. It will turn out to be true and some more advanced class. But anyhow.  I think there's a more natural answer. You're probably divided things and do proportions.  Harvard and Princeton spend more time studying  Why do we study they're both Infinity?  I wonder what the thing is.  Okay, look at this blah blah blah words Harvard Princeton two populations all the one things are gone.  blah blah blah time studying numerical variable  Hence, it must be teased. So we're down to answer is D and E.  If you're going to be paired, you got to tell me the first person in this sample from Harvard.  Who repairing them up with just Natural Choice?  Now it's never natural pair the first person on the list with the first person on the list that's just random is happen to be both first, but if you took maybe brother sisters or one went to school, then it would be natural, but you're saying random people.  Don't cry no more.  00  Okay, so this is a little complicated how it might be structured.  Are going to take his family and dump them into a quartet.  How many girls you got out of your three children 0 Girls 1 Girl two girls or three girls?  Then you're going to see if that has a good fit.  To what binomial would predict?  so when I see follows  Right there. That's how I know. This is Chi Squared goodness of fit test. Single word.  Okay, so if you look at the rest of the slides, there's a bunch of stuff about choosing the right model. If you want to practice that metacognitive action, there's also a problem at the very end that sort of brings together a lot of things. That's hard.  But I will see you on Monday. I want to wish you all luck and thank you for a great term.  Thanks all have a good weekend. "
