I randomly choose a gender on this problem flip a coin.  Chris Cornell has two sides coin perpetuate gender binaries.  And we have this problem. We're getting X bigger than 72 write and read this.  frustrating situation  How we going to find that area? Well, all I have to do is doing interval, right? And this is where we left off with this frustrating integral here. Now when you take enough advanced math, you learned that there are a lot of functions. You can't integrate no matter how hard you try.  And people say function is not in trouble in elementary terms, which is the only allowed to use the normal functions that appear in everyday life basically, so that phrase sort of means that there's no way to do this. So what did people do  Once they discovered it was impossible. Well, they started Building Technology to help approximate. The answer technology can just put millions of rectangles in in place of a shaded area. Right and it will basically get you the area you want. So one thing you can do is go to our and use commands there. So we're going to be in this class. So the norm means you're doing something on a normal curve the p means you would like to find probabilities. That is areas underneath it.  Okay, so you got to tell it the exciting place where it all begins 72.  And you need to tell her which normal curve your on so you can specify that through these parameters mean is 65 standard deviation of 3.5. So whatever those are for your curve typos in now if you leave those blank it will assume you mean a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 which will later call the standard normal curve. But if you don't want the standard normal curve, if you want something particular then the last thing I have to do is tell which way to shade so should have shade toward the lower tail on the left side. No in this case you want to shade for the right side or the upper tail so you can say gets. That's what the capital F is doing here. So you need your place need the parameters to tell you which curve Iran and you need to tell it which way to shade. So you'll either use the word tail gets true.  If you don't want to specify that parameter, it will assume lower tail is true. So it always start from negative infinity and go to your place rather than taking your place and going to the right.  Okay, so that spits out some answer 02275. So apparently only 2.275% of women meet this high threshold that you have put down that is a small multiplier to throw onto a dating proposition. You get maybe one small multiplier in your dating calculus.  You don't get multiple unless you plan on going on thousands of dates in your life.  Now the other way to do this is to look up something in a table, which is how things were done in the past. You have a table that lists every possible probability the trouble with this is you need a table for every different meaning for every different standard deviation. And then you need to have basically every possible play someone who care about on the x-axis.  That seems like a lot of table attached.  It's a bad taste in your mouth, huh?  Well, maybe there's some way to just make one table and then we'll figure out what to do from there. So that's we're going to do today is get ourselves down to that one table if you want to use tables. Okay. Now on the exam you have your calculator some of your calculators do fancy things.  I'm confined all these like technology can like our and for those people who don't will be a table included with your exam and I will always make the solutions.  Using the tables which of the less precise thing.  So let's dive into the world of normal curves. Now that we've seen some of the issues that are going to come up. So first thing that happens in life is the following.  When you start thinking about normal curves if you deal with this tissue, which will be relevant.  You sit on the admissions committee for UCSD. Congratulations. You're not have a job that makes about 60,000 and your happiness is to maximize was salary. Now focus on the other maximization one person is sat got a 1775. This is on the old 2400 point system.  The other person to pact what is that and got a 27? Which would you admit?  What's the act out of what's a good score on the ACT? What do you say?  36. Okay. Now, it's got a 36 doesn't tell you what the average is.  Symmetrical distribution is symmetrical distribution block. Who knows right? This comes down to is that these different tests are using different unit systems ones ASAP point. The other is 80 points.  And you need to understand how each of these data 27 or 17 75 relate to their universes. Like you said, what's the distribution of these things? I'd be super helpful. So what's there to do in order to answer question? Like this is create something called a z-score. So this is nothing more than taking your data value that could be the number 1775 subtracting the average it's going on in that dataset. So you might have you might know the average SAT score.  Does anyone know that on a 2400 point system?  1500 oh my goodness. You're on fire today.  You don't need to know how spread out SAT scores. Are you starting today to I like that snark is it's your shirt that doesn't know standard deviation. Sat Universe could all be tightly clustered around 1500 and then to 1775 would feel like a miracle or they could be ways but out and then it's unsure.  So what does it doing? First of all, it's making a unitless idea cuz the numerator units in the denominator units will cancel each other out. You're going to compare apples and oranges you need to.  on fruits them  Okay. I'm not sure what that meant.  What it's really doing is telling you how many standard deviations above or below the mean you are. So saying here you are subtracting meet make a distance from the mean.  And it is dividing it into standard deviation cookies and telling you how many standard deviation cookies fit in that space.  Okay, so how about I give you the data that you need to answer this question and let's see if you can do this in one minute. I went to the Google and it told me.  Is it you're going to let the person in 1 minute to make a decision about a human beings future?  30 seconds  Do you want to choose?  The right person you don't want to choose poorly.  You agree to people think it's true.  That's Monroe people. We should go to some non front row people.  Mistake to let in the wrong person.  You forgot about a 1000.  Okay, there's a minute. We'll see how you did.  You calculate the z-score of each that tells you how far above or below the mean and standard deviations.  Someone is so the SAT persons about 1.1 standard deviations above average.  Is 1.29 you chosen wisely? The ACT person has been let in.  Never thought about this before.  You never done this course what this is doing a sort of creating a ruler that will measure anything in life.  The way it works is by taking away the units of the thing you give it. It's kind of slick that way. So this allows for apples and oranges comparisons if one is interested in trying to compare a cross fruits.  Now here's a crazy idea as soon as you see the z-score idea.  What if you took all of your data and some data set and did this to every single data point use z-score to all of them?  So let me show you me doing this and some piece of statistical software. So I took 5000 random SAT scores.  They had an average of about 1501.  There's random data for you the spread out in this was a little more spread out than they should have been 252 vs250 on the left is the histogram of all of them you noticed they're centered where they're supposed to be around 1501 and then spread out as they should be and then ID scored them all. So every single one of these little pieces of area represented a possible value on the x-axis. It got slammed through the formula and then we created its equivalent version over here. You'll notice the picture looks identical.  Okay, I'll have to do is choose the right scaling on the axe used to make it look identical.  He also noticed some other things for example, it appears the new picture is centered at 0.  You can see that based on these values way up here.  and it looks like the new spread out in this is uno  might this always be true. If this were always true, it would find a way to take any dataset and sort of.  Make a standardized.  We would have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 that would be very useful cuz then we could take any possible normal distribution.  and convert it to  some standard normal Ashton some miracle.  First let's imagine. Our data set is a random variable. Call Dax the box. I hit a button you get an SAT score and you get an SAT score and everybody gets an SAT score. I just keep hitting the button over and over and it has some standard deviation. So what we're doing when we z-score stuff is for basic creating a new random variable which takes the old values subtracts the mean of them and divides by they're spread out anise.  And if you ever want to know the expected value of some random variable you can put Annie around it.  Now in this case putting e Ramsey the same thing as putting eat around x- Mew over Sigma.  And luckily we know lots of rules to deal with exponential expected value. So for example, I could probably pull out this constant.  We have that fancy little rule. I could take the expected value of x plus a constant and just write the expected value of x and then add or subtract the constant.  And now you say what what's the expected value of x?  new we set it up right here, right the very top so we are going to get me and minus, Mew which is 0  This is why when you see Square everything the new mean is zero you basically is subtracted way where everything was centered from you can think about in two steps big hot mess of data. First thing you do is subtracted me. So just takes all the day to move it over here. So now it's centered at 0 and the next thing you use / Sigma which one is everything in for the origins. What is standard deviation one? That's what is really doing in two stages.  Okay, let's see. If you can prove the standard deviation is exactly equal to one.  You have all the skills you need.  She is related to act right?  So when we try the same thing standard deviation of Z will just be standard deviation of x minus new over Sigma and then you think back what are all those rules about standard deviation of random variable. Well one roll as you can pull a constant out somebody put an absolute value on it take nits already positive.  Another rule is x - Mew has exactly the same spread his ex so I can just erase the - Mew.  And we know what standard deviation of X is cuz we defined it to be the symbol called Sigma Sigma Sigma Uno.  So here's the mathematical proof what's bothering you?  Whenever you have a random variable.  If it's perfectly defined and has some density function called f of x you can always go find the expected value the variance and the standard deviation is on the homework a few times, right?  now it's a little weird because  I'm just sort of imagining that all SAT scores of every one ever is all decided people that are dead not even born yet. So I'll decide it and we've mapped it out. So we'll have a distribution what you're thinking of is like what happen when you collect data, you can get different standard deviations, right? So you have to sort just imagine all possible everything cover for a moment and then it feels like a constant. That's a great question. It's a little janky of a  Approach the shyness, but it's the cleanest way.  Okay. So here's what you know now z-scores are this tool to compare cross universes. That's the first thing you do you realize and then if you applied it to every point in a dataset you create a new date that they were centered at 0 and has standard deviation one. So with this allows you to do is if you ever have a complicated situation where you might have lots of different models all describing things, you can try to join them together down here under one common model the standardized version standardization just means subtract the mean divided by the standard deviation. It moved away from using particular units to some standardized unit list thing.  That's all it's going on. Okay. So here are three different settings that use normal models. We talked about sat obviously and blood pressure length of fish.  Okay now, oh my goodness, he'll be so exhausting to try to deal with all of these universes independently, but once you put them all through a z-score, they all moved to a standard normal distribution. This is a term. You should definitely know it's nothing more than the normal model where the mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 it's the simplest possible normal you could ever create and so all we need to do is any question in one of these top settings. We just need to convert it to an equivalent question on the standard normal model.  And if you're going to make me a pretty table and print it out and attach it to an exam. It will be about the standard normal model.  So all you have to do is just convert the question in your Universe to the standard normal universe and then the table can help you answer it.  That's a brilliant idea that people came up with and they're lots of families of distributions out there and you tend to go see printed a table for the stamp the standardized version of what's going on. So, let me show you what this looks like.  Find the percentage of students that have an SAT score below 1800.  Maybe you don't want to admit these maybe these are exactly the students go on a Target at your in your University depends what you're going for. So the first thing is you need to understand the distribution of SAT scores.  all ever  And then you need to Mark the place you care about and we want all these people here to the left of 1800. So we need to find this area that area is a probability areas under densities. Always give you probability. Your first choice is to stay in the original setting and break out the most powerful technology that exists.  If it's most powerful technology should allow you to stay in the original setting. So let's set up a random variable first. So X should be distributed as a normal Saturday 1525 * 25 tens 250.  You can use the is distributed by if you like that symbol you can use equal to I don't really care.  And hear X represents the SAT score of a random person hit a button that your SAT score. Hope you liked it.  It lots of times over and over and over millions of times make a histogram of all those you get this pretty little curve right here.  Okay. So now we want the probably X is less than 1800. So we just need some technology that can allow us to do this. So I'm going to go to are ignoring for the normal model type T4. I want to find probabilities that is areas under curves now are desperately wants to go from negative Infinity to a place that's a default setting you just have to decide if you want to do that or not. And if we do start accumulating all that area keep going and so on. Okay, so I just typed in the particular curve we had here the place of interest and which way you wanted to shade.  now if you are fancy CS person  You'll know that in lots of languages parameters this with these things separated by commas are have default values. And I mentioned the default values are going to be 0 for the mean and one for the standard deviation. So here we actually need to stay with these are  if your fancy CS person you also know that there's an order in which parameters must come.  And you don't have to put these names of things as long as you know, what order everything should happen in so I usually don't say mean gets an SD gets those are the names of the parameters. But if you want to do things out of order, then you have to name them. But if you do them in order you can skip all that kind of stuff.  Okay. So here's our answer 88.493 % so 88 and a half percent chance. I'm going to be below 80. So if you're not interested in these people, you've thrown out a big chunk of the population there better be some good reason you did that. So I stayed in the original setting.  Next choice move to a standardized setting cuz you love standardized universes.  So what you have to do is take the original thing and imagine if yous be scored the entire visualization right there.  That when you're doing that what you're creating is a new random variable Z, which is just the original minus new over standard deviation. That's the formulaic way. You show what you're doing and Visually the way you showed you got exactly the same distribution.  except  now some of the labels on the axes are different X here has become Z. The old mean has become zero.  you'll standard deviation, which is not seen in the picture has become one and the one interesting crucial thing is with this point 1800 goes to  You can see it goes to 1.2 in the way you get that is by taking 1800 and putting it through the z-score formula.  So the equivalent question down here is about finding the area less than 1.2.  Now if you want to skip all the pictures and just have algebra carry you in life. Here's a nice way to do it algebraically take the original question P of X less than 1800 and do the z-score operation to both sides of an equality. Check 1500 / 250.  Have a cool thing about this is the left hand side is going to just become Z. But the definition of Z and the right-hand side is going to become the new number 1.2 if you cared so desperately about finding  so there's a way to do without pictures.  Do you like it?  You do.  Okay, that's good. I'm glad that you like it. That's just buying time for them to write.  Okay. Now how would you solve this whelp go to the computer?  Now it's just 1.2 is the first number and 0 and 1 and we still want to shade off toward the left side the lower tail of a distribution.  Now this is incredibly inefficient. You don't need to tell the computer. The meeting is 0 and standard deviation was one it's going to assume that if you don't tell it anything, you don't need to tell it to stay to the left it wants to do that automatically. You can actually just take P Norm 1.2.  . End of sentence and I'll give you the same answer.  I know this will seem silly right like why I converted to this new universe when the computer could already do the old universe.  So you should probably never do this.  person in between  now what happens if you don't have technology and we're sitting there on an exam. Well, you have this weird table in front of you and this table is going to help you find areas. The table, of course is only written for the standard normal distribution. So first you got to convert the problem over.  Then you have to go and look up what's going on in the table.  So  how's the table going to be structured?  It's very strange how people structure tables and different books will structure them differently. So you always have to learn what your book does.  And how precise it is and so on. So we want the area to the left of 1.2 first thing as you should round it to two decimal places. So now it's 1.20 very exciting. Right? And the way the table is going to work is going to have you dissect this number into the second decimal place and everything to the left of the second decimal place and those two numbers are going to help you look up and find the area that you care about here to the left of 1.2. So here's what your table looks like.  Your table desperately wants to start accumulating area and negative infinity and go to some place.  Okay, where is it going to go to? Well, the place it goes to is divided up here between the left column and the top row.  Okay, so that 1.2. I was talking about you can see gets us to this place in the table and the second decimal place was 0 right so you can see all the second decimal places are listed here. Okay, and it's at the intersection of the column in the row.  That you will find the area you care about so the things inside the table or all areas their probabilities.  The things along the top row and the left column together make up a z-score a place along the horizontal axis of the picture.  So take some like memorizing of how these are structured in order to understand how to use them.  so  we got the same answer. That's good.  Place at the table is correct, right.  Anyone worried about table stuff?  Now there's tables on the internet on tradenet. I've already posted these I think I'll go take a look in a second. Are they all there?  Who knows but anyhow was try problem. You'll need a table for this.  10 year olds regardless of gender  Have Heights that are modeled by this normal distribution on average to 55 in tall is 6 in standard deviation what percentage of 10 year olds can ride Space Mountain?  You must be 44 in in order to ride Space Mountain.  So draw me a picture to find some variables. You could try using at the technology on your calculator. If you plan on using your calculator in the exam if you know how your calculator does statistical things or you can start practicing using tables if you want to use those.  I can't tell you how to work your calculator cuz there a 95 different calculators in the room and because  I don't know how to work your calculator.  I do things in our and tables.  That's just me.  Sorry, actually, there's a document online on TriNet. If you have one of the standard two or three most common calculators so you can see if yours falls into that list and guess what the internet has facts on it.  You can try that too.  weather on Friday night  You're being stupid to a survey right now and have people raise their hands.  I want to see how many people Define a random variable.  And actually said what it meant.  How many people got a probability statement down how many people do a picture Etc very interesting? Okay. Here's the picture what's going on? This is the original Universe 44 is the exciting thing and if you know anything about life to go and ride, you must meet the height or be taller. So you should have shaded up those be acceptable Heights. So here took some real world knowledge to figure out which way to shade the diagram.  Okay. So here I set up my random variable X it would have been even better. If you would put some sentence like X is the height of a random child going to Space Mountain.  Then you know it is like there's a box. I hit a button side of the next child that shows up and then another one keep hitting that button.  Now for people with calculators, you can stay in the original setting if you know what you're doing.  Okay, or if you're on homework any one of these are just started 44 don't go to the lower tail and Beyond the original curve and you get 96.66.  SI most children can go if you're on the exam then you're going to have to have course.  Use tables unless you know what you're doing with your calculator and I will always write the exam. So it's doable with the table cuz I don't want people to spend $130 and some calculator.  So if you're going to use your calculator in the exam you better tell me what you're typing into it. You should write a statement that looks like what I just wrote in our here.  That way we know that you know, what's going on.  Okay, if you can use a table, then I will get to see you trying to convert things over to a universe and which tables are appropriate that is you need to be converting things to the standard normal distribution.  So I'll see you in the original setting.  I'll see you if you decide to draw second picture converting over to the standard normal curve.  And in the process of see you calculating this very important z-score right here.  That some people won't always draw the pictures they'll decide you know, what I'm just going to use the formulas. So for those people I'll see you doing the appropriate steps in the formulas subtract the mean in / the standard deviation to both terms on each side of being a quality.  And I'll see you moving over to the Z universe and the -1.83.  Okay, then I'll trust that you could break that up to -1.8 and .03 when you go to the table.  Now the frustrating thing if you actually try this about tables.  Is here so tables into work.  They tend to want to accumulate area from negative Infinity to a place but that's not what we want to do in this problem.  So, how do you fix a tissue? Yeah.  You subtracted from 1.  Good because one represents all of the area under any density curve in particular the normal density curve. And if you subtract away, you will take away that and just leave the blue here.  So then I would see on the table people this kind of subtraction from one going on. So that's how I would know. So if you want to save the money, it means you have to write a little more stuff, but that's okay.  Pencil lead is pretty cheap. Last time I checked. So here's his calculation. So here you go to -1.8 down the side and you find your .03 up the top you find intersection that gives you an area remember, it's just the area to the left of the place -1.83 and then you subtract that number from Uno to get our same answer as before.  Magic, huh?  I would strongly suggest.  You practice doing both of these?  If your calculator runs out of batteries in the middle of the exam if you can't remember what buttons to hit.  tables with a view  if you're going to be a table person in life great, but it helps have some experience with r and Technology.  And we're going to be using all these dpq are functions for every distribution. So give him more practice with them which is why I would do some table work or some computer work.  What time you try another problem? I see people are a little sleepy right now.  It must be week 4.  Midterms exhaustion is setting in.  Play time for American men on a weekday. You can go look this up. Ask every American man ever on a weekday how much they slept.  You're get a normal distribution center that 6.9 hours. How you doing?  above or below average  standard deviation of 1.5 what percentage of the men are within one standard deviation of the mean sleep time.  Let's see how you do with this again tables are on Titan Ed. You have a cell phone. Let's make some things happen.  There's your two minutes.  Isn't it just 68% Why is it just 68%  slick  because it good.  So some of you know some facts something about 68% Loblaw within one standard deviation blah blah normal curve and you should have discovered that. Okay. So if you did the problem in the original settings, you can just go add and subtract the standard deviation. We get 5.4 + 8.4  Now the problem with that that's one of a weird area, right? Okay. It's sort of stops at these ends. So you can imagine it as the area all the way through 8.4 and then subtract.  When you go through 5.4 and both of these shapes have gone look like things that you can look up on a table.  Now if you want to Z table, you got to go convert right? But now you can also do this in our you see me starting to compress things. So 8.4 will give us this area. You notice me not listing mean and standard deviation cuz I know the order in which to put things the mean come second the standard deviation is third-place you care about his first and here I am subtracting and we get 68.27  about 68  that must mean the pies about 3.  I mean 68.27 went to 68. So 3.14. I should go to 3, right.  something something rounding  Okay.  68% of American men are within one standard deviation.  Now, it's some if you remember as this rule that like this is always true doesn't matter what curved you start on and in fact, it is called the 68-95-99 .7% rule. So anytime you have a normal distribution. That is very important.  normal then  Amount of area within one standard deviation go up and down the stigma will give you sixty 8mm Ember me saying earlier in the course that if you go up a sigma and down as Sigma you get most stuff. Well if the stuff is normal,  When you get exactly 68% of the stuff and 95% of the stuff will be within two standard deviations. That's both the blue and the green area here and if you want to go all the way up to three standard deviations, 99.7% of your data will live inside there.  So this is just a very helpful rule to memorize the fastest way to convince yourself of this rule is to go into our and to type these sorts of calculations. These are doing things on the standard normal. How much area is to the left of one standard deviation minus? How much is to the left of negative 1?  68.27 which way round to 68  very interesting  Should we try a quick fuse?  Find you can just do some quick things if the problem is super contrived. So here's your super contrived problem average SAT score at Harvard on the old 2400 scale.  2250  are you above or below average at Harvard?  on their SAT scores, whatever that measures  McCall that SAT scores have this distribution. Well, what you could do in a problem like this weekend about this place 2250 on the horizontal axis now and it's probably just happens to be exactly 3 standard deviations above the mean for the setting. How convenient  So, you know some facts about areas.  And you just say what what is this problem want? It just wants the people right here above the 3 standard deviation mark  So there's lots of ways now to get yourself to how much area is there because you know, lots of things about this picture. So first you could focus on the people who are Beyond 3 standard deviations either high or low.  And that area is going to be .3% and then you could / to cut out those low performers.  So .15% of people.  Go to score high enough to be above the Harvard average.  Have you been following the Harvard admissions Scandal stuff?  Turn the news right now. They're being sued.  the ideas that they discriminate against asian-americans  I don't remember all the  the reasons  something about trying to have diversity and so they do really well. And so then they're not I don't know about it's super complicated. I have a friend who teaches at Harvard and I'm going to talk to him this weekend about what's going on.  Hey how  That was for the other thing.  We've been always giving you a place on the horizontal axis and thing find some area. I could also give you area and say find the place on the axis that is known as percentile. You've heard about this all your life. Maybe now it will make more sense. Once we have some framework underneath us.  Okay. So here we go. Anytime you put a number down. You can Shades at the left and tells you the percentage of people you're better than on whatever this metric is, okay?  And you can go figure out what that area is and we've done this before right?  Now if I give you this number 88.5% it's possible to go backwards and get this 1800. So they're linked together, right?  So what a percentile is when someone says you're at the 80th percentile, you're saying the area below you wherever you are.  Is 2.88.  The percentiles refer to places along this horizontal axis.  But the way you described the place on the horizontal axis is not by telling me where it is, but you tell me how much area is to the left of it. It's a sort of awkward way of talking about things.  So this is going to feel weird and backwards for a while. So let's say you form your new college and you only want people at the 99 percentile are better what SAT would be the minimum you would allow.  Okay, so when you see the word percentile, you should remember it's asking about a place on the horizontal axis is doing so by telling you the area to the left of that place.  So you would want to draw a picture and forcibly make the area .99 to the left of whatever place you Mark here. And you put a? And you want to figure it out, but that's the 99th percentile right there.  Okay. Well, how would you do this in our  well in our there's a nice function called to Norm the way I think about P Norman to Norma's they are sort of reciprocity. I puncture wounds but one does the other one does so normally put X locations in Depew Norman get out areas to normal take areas and give you out locations to the left of which that much area would have occurred. So it spits out the x value.  So he stands for the Q stands for quantile.  Which is a kind of percentile idea and the gentlest form so that's where that comes from. So tell me how much area is to the left of the place you were seeking in life by nine. Tell me what curve on which the seeking is happening and I will spit out the place 2081.  So there's the 99th percentile you can toss anyone who doesn't mean that cut off at your new College.  That's a pretty high bar.  Now how you going to do this in tables?  Let's try a little problem here you decide you're going to get more sleep than 93% of American you want to be well rested and you decided 93 is your number? Okay. So here's to sleep curve normal 6.9 1.5.  And the 93% is an area so it should appear in the middle of the table. So you don't go from the ends in word you go from N word out. So first locate .93 in the table.  That's not exactly there. She always going to choose. Okay Point 9306. This one is .929 to I don't care which one you choose.  Choose either if someone told you like some methods remember which one to choose that's all silly. Okay, sleep times are perfectly modeled by this normal thing in the first place there so many layers of approximation built into what we're doing it to get worked up over some tiny little thing is silly. So choose your favorite one is closed 2.93 and work your way back out.  Now the trouble is the table set up for the standard normal.  So it's giving you a z-score.  That's a place on the horizontal axis for the standard normal. So if you care about your original setting you need to set that value equal to the Z Sword version of your setting so x minus whatever the meaning is over 1.5. So go get yourself 9.12 hours of sleep tonight.  Take care. "
