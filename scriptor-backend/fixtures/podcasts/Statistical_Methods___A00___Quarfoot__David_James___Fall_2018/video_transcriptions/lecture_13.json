    "Full Transcript": "everyone  before we start  goodness  two pieces of Life advice  how you might change your behavior? They will be more productive for you. The first is I think a lot of people come to class and watch a movie.  And when I asked you to try to do things one out of four people gets at it hard. I'd love to see that 4 out of 4 people. It would be the equivalent of going to the gym and watching people workout.  Obviously that would seem foolish but in the same sitting here of Academia parallel setting I see similar things.  The other is how people use office hours at EA's and I had a big talk today about what that look like. And he said there's a lot of people that they go there and do their homework. And then the TA is there to just be there tutored any possible moment. So this is not the best way to use office hours. I think coming in with targeted questions about things you thought a very long time about and struggle with it's a much better way go in after questions get out. This is what all the stars in graduate school look like and I had them talk about their graduates experiences and what they look like and two a tea it was the same and then I said what happens when your students come totally different didn't look anything like that. So you should use classes like 183 not as a chance to just learn material but as a chance to transition your behavior to what it looks like for graduate students to be doing things because many of you will go do that.  And you want to put the best?  Behaviors in place so that you can achieve the most success and continue to go on in life. Anyhow,  and into the gentle or chapter 4  it's time for us to talk about everybody.  That is populations so far. We just been dealing with basically individual data sets and trying to summarize them and talk about their mean and standard deviation. But we have the larger problem of what happens when you have some huge population and there's something about them. You want to summarize. Well, this will be called a parameter. This is a number that summarizes an entire population population could just have a hundred fifty people in it or it could have 6 billion people.  So there's a lot of variability in population size. Now, what we're going to do here is obviously if the world is really big you can't ask everybody what's going on. So maybe you care about this all adults in the US. There's our population. OK it's got like 650 million it and you want to know the average weight of an American.  You're not going to ask them all and if you tried people would die faster or before you could talk to them and knew people would come into adulthood as they turned 18. So what you need to sort of instantaneous way to do everything which doesn't exist. So instead what you do is you draw sample and Sample is just a small hopefully representative subset of this big giant mess that you were known as the population. And in that sample that data said you calculate the idea that you're excited about and this is called a statistic hence the name statistics a statistic is a summary of a sample SSS.  That's how I remember this population parameters statistics in samples. Okay, so 30 adults and you go find the average of those 30 and we talked about better and worse ways to sample earlier to slide. Look familiar.  You've kind of seen it already believe it or not.  Now sampling is the act of doing this process well, but is choosing a representative subset and we talked about ways better and worse ways to do that. What we need to do now is talk about inference, which is the act of lifting up your result from this tiny little subset of people and trying to make claims about larger groups of people now, this can be done very sloppily.  And then it's called Prejudice or it can be done in a more statistical way and then you're trying to give a measured response.  Now whenever you draw a sample and you calculate your statistic, this is called a point estimate. It is one value at points of number and it's an estimate. But you have to remember that these statistics will always just be estimates and when you draw different samples, you're going to get different values that's called random variation.  So you can't just believe that the result you got in your little group is the results. You should put on the entire population.  Okay, if I use you guys and I measure IQ, obviously you are not representative of America.  Your way higher, right? Cuz you come through screening process these they have some IQ measure along the way right? Let some judgment just like backs. Okay. So you've seen this in real life all these political polls Twitter very exciting right now, right? Why did they give different numbers all the time? Well, sometimes it's because they're biased but sometimes they have great methodology and random variation happens. That's all so you can get three different numbers supporting when you ask the same thing on the same day the three different samples.  Now we're going to care about the size of the sample and that'll be our notation for this and it turns out that the size will give you some kind of indication of how much you should believe in your data.  Bigger is somehow better. If you want to know the average weight of Americans. You don't talk to one person.  An average there one result together you feel better about more, right?  So this is encapsulated in this picture here.  So there's some population with tons and tons of people. Okay, and you want to measure something about them and this dash line is that true value if you could talk to everyone simultaneously get all the results and do whatever you want. Maybe find the average.  And dysgraphia showing what happens as you ask different sizes of samples what's going on? You see there's incredible volatility when you don't ask many people in your sample size, but it said he's getting better as you ask more and more people. In fact as you take the limit as n goes to the actual size of the population. Maybe it's a trillion people or whatever you're measuring then you can get the actual value of the parameter.  So let's put up some scenarios and see what you like better. What's your intuition is for these things?  How bad will my estimate be so here's our setting we're going to land on some alien planet and your whole job in life is to find the average weight of all the aliens that live on this planet. If you want, you can call it Earth.  Which setup makes you feel better when you go do your point estimate?  How do I say suck a hand or not a hand?  Are you willing to talk to us?  Why 300?  It gives a better population size. I don't know what it was.  And nothing gives the population size is just decided. I have you to find your population.  You're right the answer 300.  Like that movie more is better than I just say that there you go. Is this a little picture that showed the convergence of the idea toward the True Value? Okay. Let's make ones that are harder. So now you get the idea right now. It's just when you look at the weights you see in your sample.  Would you rather them all be around 200?  Would you rather see Wild variation?  What you going to do with these numbers whose average them?  Who wants to take a chance?  Go ahead.  Suppose the samples you we just assumed are always drawn very well.  What would you say? What do you like better great methodology was used. We just see these different possibilities.  you know that your sample is  do you disagree?  You don't know anything about them. You don't get to use anything.  What do you say?  the average  Okay, so you heard some different lines of thinking now?  Here's what the answer he says all around 200.  If the samples are really drawn, well, that means they should represent the population. So you can't start describing weird things in the population that you're worried about cuz the sample would have captured those.  So if everyone's around 200, I feel really good about averaging goes. Okay, everyone's tightly clustered around the True Value.  But if you see all this wild variation, it's suggested up in the population. There's wild variation and it's very hard to capture. What's really going on when there's a lot of wild variation. Okay. So next thing the population from which things are being drawn could either be normal and this is own or it could be uniform between 50 and 2:50 when you draw your samples from those universes and you find your point estimates Your Average  What you feel better about?  glad  WeatherBug normal exactly the same thing as the one above just didn't tell you that.  There's a lot of wild variation in here right until when you take samples going to see Wild variation, but hear things are starting to Cluster around this Center, whatever it is.  Until you're going to get less radiation. Okay, so if that if your intuition doesn't line up with these things will just recalibrate your intuition.  So let's go explore. This thing called Esky.  exploratory software for confidence intervals by Jeff coming  So let me show you how this works. Just coming to see statistics education researcher explores how people learn statistics and how to make that better. There aren't many such people in the US. So if that interests you you could be on The Cutting Edge of things. So yours is going on here are aliens and here's a distribution that shows their weights. They desperately want to be 50 lb or whatever the units are on this. Okay. Now, what I'm going to do is first show you what their average weight is there it is at the center of the distribution, right? But let's pretend we don't know that lets pretend you don't see that blue distribution at the top. Hey that's having perfect knowledge about the thing that you want to study but you never have so how do you actually study things? Well, you say I'm going to draw sample. So here I can change how many people are in the sample we can make it bigger. We can make it smaller. Let's just set it at 2:15.  Take a sample. Okay, so you get these blue. These are the people.  They just fell into your sample. You can imagine throwing pennies somewhere on this distribution. And once they're thrown there just let them fall down to their X values. And those are the weights of the aliens. Okay, and you know, this is a bunch of them. Now you have yet to do anything. We want to go find a point estimate, don't we?  So let's go take the mean from our sample. There it is that green. So when you do a study you collect all those blue circles and then you do something with them and you get the green.  And you're very excited, right?  Now the only way you can decide if you are green. Is any good?  Is by considering all the possible green dots that could have been created.  How do you know if you're smart?  How do you know if you're good looking how do you know if your athletic?  You compare yourself against every other thing that could exist all the other human beings, right? And that's the definition of these terms in our society the relative terms.  So what we could do here is we could imagine doing this over and over and over.  shall we  Now as you do this over and over you keep getting different samples. Those are the blue dots that keep flashing up and from your sample. You'll calculate the mean that's the top Queen.  And these are just going to keep happening and happening and ideally you'd like to do this infinitely many times.  And which will create in the process is a picture of the green Universe where they know the blue universe that's the individual weights of aliens. What's happening down here is where creating the possible values for the sample mean the average within your sample. And guess what that's a random variable it varies from sample to sample. Some averages are spot on right you can see all the ones that are super close to the line, but every once in awhile, you get a queasy weird sample and it gives you a crazy average like this. On the far left.  bloatware  I hate you one drive. No one wants you we all on Google.  Oh my gosh.  If we did this infinitely many times, I've slowly fill up this picture at the bottom, right and you could imagine that there would be some smooth curb you could draw through it. So why don't I draw you that thing?  So there is the smooth curve down there.  that describes the possible Universe of  Sample means X bars if you wish sanitation were going to be using.  Okay, so now you can see like there's very soon life. So if you're if you want to know if your green. Good all we have to know is that green Universe right there?  If a green universe is nice and tight around this line coming down then I'm going to feel good. If it's green. The universe is a big hot mess that spans each way forever basically and I'm really worried about my particular estimate cuz it's part of a family of estimates kind of garbage e  Okay, is it runs and runs, right?  Are you in translate yet?  Does it feel old timey?  Excel like really isn't there an app for that there is to see it later.  So just a rehash everything we just did cuz a lot just happen. First of all, this is beautiful picture, right? So what's going on first up here is the distribution of the weights of individual aliens.  You never get to see this. It's hidden from you. It tells you that relatively aliens on this planet love to be 50 lb, but you can get things way out here at 0 or up at 100. Okay, then we had all these little blue dots those were the individual aliens in one sample.  And with that one sample, you can calculate one statistic the average amount of your 15 or 20 numbers or whatever. Then you could imagine repeating this process many many times. How about infinitely many or like you doing are sometimes you run a 10000 times don't you just imagine that so down here this thing and this is important terminology this sampling distribution distribution, cuz it shows you what's going on like a visualization sampling because it's about all the possible samples that could ever be drawn.  And what's not captured in that language is what you did with those samples. So here I took the average of all the weights of the people, but you could do other things you could look at What proportion Identify some way or you could measure the spread out and it's of the blue dots.  So any sort of math operation you could apply you could do there. So it sort of always suppress what the operation was what the statistic was. So let's put notation on things now first thing up in the cloud that you never see.  Are some different things going on. So this is a normal distribution cuz I made it one it didn't have to be but it will be centered somewhere. I'm calling that Miu that is our goal. We want to know that number. The only way I'd ever truly know it is to ask everyone in the population at the same instant believe that the tell you the truth.  and then averages  Kansas also spread out and disappear so you can see me drawing dashed lines in here. Now. That's Towing one standard deviation.  Okay, next thing in your sample. You have lots of dots. They have a certain spread out in this I'm using S Sub X that's the standard deviation of these x-values. I'm calling them ex because he was the x axis is horizontal axis right here hex bar. It's in rotation use for the average in the sample. And it's where that green. Is horizontally left right was  Queso notation for the population notation for the sample. You'll notice something immediately that's different about the two.  Up here in the population in the cloud in the heavens Greek letters.  Down with all the pedestrian actual individuals in your sample Latin letters. This will be a convention that lots of people use to help you distinguish where you are. It's really really useful. Okay now down here at the bottom.  There's some Center to this distribution and there's some spread out in this you can see the spread out and it's visually because I put these little - green lines.  Okay, and it looks maybe not a spread out if things were out there.  Make sense. Usually when you start averaging a bunch of stuff together you get less variation.  It averages away all the craziness that happens. So what we'd like to know first is wit which model best describes this curve here and then we want to figure out the center and spread.  Well, what do you think?  What model is that green thing? What random variable?  Why'd you say normal?  You said normal because it's normal. That's tautological.  Circular you can't just say it is because it is.  It appears.  Some weird thing in your visual complex has encoded what normal things look like in that looks like one, right? Okay. Where do you think it is centered?  At the mean of the population see that new up there cuz it looks like it falls perfectly there.  Okay, now I can press if you could guess your way into the spread.  That's more complicated. So you guessed all the beautiful easy things that you should be able to guess at this point. So first thing the visual appearance of it suggests that this thing is going to be normal and centered at Mew. Those are both true. Okay, so I don't need a new letter to talk about where it centered but I do need some notation to talk to about how spread out it is. Okay. So this amount of spread here the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.  We're going to call the standard error is just a term. You have to know it's abbreviated SE.  It gets very very tiresome to say the standard deviation of the sampling distribution over and over. So people say standard are so you can show in a high-level class. That is just Sigma / \u221a end. So safe mode with how spread out the blue Universe was so it should probably involved that right.  Hospital getting you start with and it should also depend on n  bigger is better, right?  So somehow gets encoded into Sigma / \u221a and when you do a bunch of math, and then the last thing is that that is normal because it looks normal right while you can actually prove.  and maybe there's something on the homework where you  had the average together a bunch of things and I told you that the sum of a bunch of normal things with normal. Well, the average of a bunch of normal things is also normal.  Kerasotes props more tractable formula for this distribution down here normal standard it Mew with a spread out notice of Sigma over boudin.  And the cool thing is we can use this to convince you of all those things that happened earlier when I was digging into your intuition.  To see if it would do a good job or not. So let's go back to sample size. I said bigger was better, right? So let's figure out why let's compare 10 aliens to 40 aliens.  It doesn't just different n values. So here you can send me a picture. You can see a picture of me doing this in a ski, there's only 10 blue dots here and over here. There's 40 when you drop them down. You can see this curve is quite spread out. Where is this one is a little tighter around the True Value.  Okay, so I'm going to believe something. I'm have more faith in my value here because all the data tend to hug together for the truths, which is Mew but here like, I don't know if I believe my data cuz I can get some crazy weird things out of that distribution.  In fact, you can go calculate has spread out there. That's exactly what you're focused on right? So this one when you have 10 people in your sample signal through 10.  And this is Sigma Alpha Route 40 hits of this distribution on the right is half as spread out or things clustered toward the mean twice as strongly.  People love when things are consistent in life while you Engineers is like your life right to make things incredibly tightly consistent and the picture is trying to show you that idea that you love consistency that you believe in things when they're consistent. It's very hard to have friends. For example that are very erratic.  You never know how they respond to anything if I actually hold any of their commitments.  But you love it when people are consistent and hug their mean. No maybe don't like their mean Persona. That's a different thing, right?  Okay with so few aliens and I all I ever can greatly affect the sample mean to see why there's more variation. Right? Look at those crazy people up there. They destroyed the sample and made that green. So far to the right, but when you got 40 like we do here too. We have on the right side. Don't do very much the power numbers.  Wash away the Exotica.  Okay.  So this is very hard the first time you do it. There's just a lot going on there. She's different universes. They all have different notation. They have different values for Center or spread out and ask him so on. Okay, so we can we took some population and now it's time to start pretending that you can't see the blue Universe. It's hidden from you all you get to see  Is one green. Usually take a population from it draw some sample of a certain size you get to decide what that sample size is going to be.  Okay. Now it's going to turn out that this thing in the cloud that you can't see doesn't have to be normal believe it or not.  What's things aren't really normally distributed with some weird distribution. Okay, so we're going to pick RN people out and we do this we do it independently. Okay, you don't pick out an alien and say bring me your four friends. That's what they're all going to be kind of similar and wait probably if aliens kind of like humans do okay. Once you have your sample your go calculate your mean. We'll use x bar for that notation. Good old Latin letters. That's a point estimate the single value estimating the population parameter.  That is one Green Dot out of the Infiniti Green Dots.  So this is really weird because you don't see the cloud cuz that's what you're trying to study. That's what you also don't see the green universe.  Cuz that represents infinitely many samples the thing you do. See one green.  But the thing is we know what the green Universe should roughly be or we can approximated.  So then you can understand yourself against the Green universe that is a brilliant idea of Statistics right there. You don't get to see this you don't get to see this but you can approximate the green universe and hence understand yourself.  Now this independent thing how do you really know if you're choosing independent aliens?  It is a very tricky thing and it's really important to the setup here. So what you're going to see is we're always going to talk about two other conditions that we need to make sure happening in order to get red independent. So the first is when you're choosing people to include in your sample you tend to do this randomly.  Okay. Now you also don't want to choose too many people believe it or not. You don't want to dig too deep into your population. What happens is if you did too deep into your population.  The people that are at the very end that you're choosing you start to know what they are before you even do anything.  So for example, let's say I gave four people in this room some special token.  Okay, and it's like who knows how has them and they just start asking people randomly, okay.  Now if I haven't chosen too many people we don't have too many of those tokens that people been like yeah, that's me. But what happens when I've asked like 90% of the class.  The good chance. We already got all the tokens, right? It's already know the answer is if everybody before they even open their mouth you're going to say no, I don't have it. Obviously, you've seen the poor people to do. So, this is why you don't dig too deep into a population. You start to lose Independence because you know, what's going on?  so less than 10% is just sort of a general rule of thumb the people use  Okay, so where we going to do with this? How does the sampling distribution help us? This is one of the most awkward moments in the class. You have to create something called a confidence interval.  So what do you have right now at the point estimate is your best guess of what's going on, but you want to be honest to other human beings and say, you know what? I'm a little worried about my estimate because I saw one of those green pictures one, and I know there's a lot of variability in those green dots and I'm just one of them right to have to find a way to report out your value in pad it.  With some amount that shows your uncertainty. So what we're going to do is give back and interval and X bar R statistical be at the center.  Ksr. Best gas and then we're going to add some to the left and right.  Now this interval, what is trying to do is estimate Mew the population parameter. That's always what we're trying to do.  Seriously, you're trying to say I really really think of you is probably in this interval.  You're smart enough to know you never going to say I think Mew is my ex bar. You're not going to say that you seen enough Green Dots in your life to realize that's silly pop it in the center and then pad are guess so then the only question is how much do you want to pass your guest by?  Can you really like your interval to actually have new in it?  Let me give you the two extremes you could patent by none.  Here's my interval. It goes from X bar to X bar. So what's the probability Mew actually falls into that interval?  0% You have to get a green. That just landed exactly at new somehow it could happen, but it's probably zero infinity have that interval Muse in there.  What right?  okay, so these are the extremes and somewhere in between is something real reasonable perhaps  And what we need to do is figure out how wide we should make this thing. So it's got a pretty good chance of having Mew in there, but it's not so big that were saying something worthless. Basically, I mean don't tell me the average weight of an American is between 0 and 1000000000 pounds. This is not helpful, right?  It might have 100% chance of capturing new. So it's this trade-off that you're making as you think about.  This interval now we do this all the time in life. You make a decision. For example of how big of a net you're going to throw when you go try to catch fish using net fishing.  So the bigger than that you throw the more likely you are to catch some fish. Right? But it's spread out over this huge region. So it's not perfectly clear where it might be in that region. Also when someone commits a crime and you decide to set a search radius around say the art museum, well you could set it at okay. I'd like the police force to have two thousand miles of radius around. That's what you got a hundred percent chance of getting the person right, but you're no idea where they are in there. It's so worthless.  You can set a small little thing and now it's tight and controlled but the chance they're in there.  You know some number 40% 50% 60. I don't know. So the bigger or The Wider you cast the center of all the more likely you are but then also it's unclear exactly where it is in their you're losing information. So here's how you do things. This is the hardest slide for this whole chapter, I think.  Oh my goodness.  There we go.  Here's a sampling distribution. It's all the possible values. You could ever get for the statistic. What's a x bar when you get your samples over and over? How does a normal distribution right so you know that about 95% of those dots.  Should be within two standard deviations.  Of the men will hear the standard deviation was called the standard error of the sampling distribution.  Okay. So what this says is if you stood it from you at the center of that curve and you reached out one two standard deviations grab green dots you can 95% of them.  Okay, so that's one way to think about this.  It's not the clever way to think unfortunately the other ways to say, you know, what what if I just do it at random green dots and I reached out my arms.  How often are my arms going to get Mew?  Well turned out exactly the same. Does it matter if you stay in here and reach out and grab Green Dots or you asked every single green. To reach out and try to grab Mew. It's a reciprocal relationship if my distance from a bunch of things.  Is a certain amount that it's distance from me happens a certain amount of the time and that's the clever idea here.  Okay, so if you stand at a random green. And you reach out this distance to see whatever that equals in the 95% of the time you will grab Mew.  I didn't easiest to think about distance 95% of the dots.  Are within this distance of new?  So 95% of the dots Mew can be reached with that distance.  similar thing equivalent ideas  So all you have to do now.  Is if you're one green. Set that distant as your reach amount.  And then you've got a pretty good chance of grabbing me you don't you you don't know which queen. You are.  There's about the possibilities and if you were to build that interval around all of them, most of them will capture Mew. You never know if you're a capture or not.  Okay. So we're going to do is go to SD right now.  And now we're going to hit some different buttons.  Okay. So for example  So let's turn on the confidence intervals. Let's decide if they capture Mew or not. Let's clear it out.  stop  Here we go.  Hang on.  know if CVS  Well, I don't know this isn't working.  It's one of those days.  How about I just draw the picture up here? Maybe. I'll make you happy.  So here we go is what I was hoping would do was jump straight to it, except I'm okay. Now, I'm dropping down all the means right, but every time I patted them by some number and you can see like when you pass them by a certain number, some of them are green. Those are the ones that actually captured Museum use inside that interval right there.  And lots of them were capturing you every once in awhile you get a stinker.  Wear your green. Was so far away, but even when it reached out, it couldn't grab Mew.  Okay, that's going to happen. Right we had the extremes of 100% which we didn't like and 0% which we didn't like so in between  you're going to get some percent of the time that you capture this value new and that's what we'd like to set up a sort of an infrastructure.  So 95% of those should be green because I'm currently in this picture reaching out a distance of 2 standard errors. Whatever that is for this setting. So let's try one of these problems here and you'll see how this works.  Lots of conceptual things symbols around this might make you feel better. You dry your sample of 50 aliens.  In your sample you get X bar is 130.  And you get some standard deviation.  So the first thing I have to do you need to decode the information into the appropriate symbols. Keep you organized. And remember what's in the cloud. What's about our sample? What about the green curve? So first thing our stample generated this number 130, so that's going to be an x-bar and our sample is spread out about S Sub X which we got 3.8.  Okay, so they're those it was all about these blue. And they're green summary.  So, let's see how you do here.  While our best guess from you is 130.  We choose report a 95% CI.  Let's see. If you can find it. You need to build something that has X bar at the center.  And you know, you're supposed to reach out.  a certain number of standard deviations  Hear the standard deviation is about the sampling distribution. Remember SE. So this should feel very rough right now this moment you feel like a big mess. That's exactly what I want.  For all you people who think you're done. I'll ask you this question.  What Universe we should care about right now and come standard deviation do care how spread out the blue universe is.  Too sure about how spread out our sample is.  to care about how to spread out the green universes  They're currently trying to decide about your green.  Can you find a pad recognize that there's different Green Dots?  Okay, here we go.  First thing when you go to confidence interval X bar will be at the center. So all you need to do is reach up some and reach down some  I've been saying that amount is two standard errors here. I'm correcting it to 1.96 which is a more precise result. The 68-95-99 7 role was an approximation, right? So here I'm putting the exact result in you're going to see 1.96 a lot. Okay next thing standard error. That's how much you should be reaching out. If you're concerned about how good the green. Is you need 2 compared to all the other green. Well, guess what universe and they're spread out in this we said earlier was Sigma / \u221a end.  Okay, so that's what you'd be going right here.  Now here's the problem. I don't know what Sigma is.  How would one ever know Sigma the spread out news of the blue universe?  The only way you know, that is by knowing everything in the blue universe and if you already know everything in the blue Universe, why don't you just add widgets and tell me what Miu is?  So guess what? You're never going to know Sigma, but luckily we have something that's very close.  to the value of Sigma  You're probably used it. If you did something here called S Sub X. So Sigma is how spread out the blue universe is up here at the top has two backs is how spread out your sample is but your samples to look like the population if you draw a nice sample.  So there was a sub X and sigma will be roughly the same Okay. So we've already cleaned up R22 1.96 when ready to handle it earlier.  And now we're going to approximate Sigma by a sub X this what happens in the real world all the time.  Okay. So here's what you should have done X bar plus or minus the special number right here.  X SOB X over the square root of N and tear the problem tells you that end is 50.  Feels very awkward. It's going to take a long time for us to talk to you through this. So you feel comfortable. It's very strange idea. We'll get our best gas and then like pad it somehow and the way will pad. It is by recognizing the variability that happens in Green Dots in case I don't answer when you just do all the math.  And this is some units whatever these aliens are measured in.  Now there's a question of like how you actually report this out to human beings. So we're going to learn a sort of language that than most people in the world use and it looks like the following.  We're 95% confident that the true mean so the true mean is just Mew.  Is in our particular interval.  No, every time you generate a confidence interval if you might have new in it it might not you saw some of those confidence intervals were red and green on the previous slide some got new and some didn't capture it. So you never know if you got it or not.  So what does phrase basically means?  Is that we've designed this process?  Where we going to take whatever we get out of our sample xbar and he's going to Pat it by this amount and roll is going to report that out.  And this process of building these intervals has a very good chance of capturing, Mew.  95% chance in fact  But I never know if we came up with a good interval or bad interval.  You will never know in life.  Okay. So here's the true interpretation of this winter confident in the wrong thing. That's what everyone thinks.  You can do these studies where you ask undergrad and grad and professors. You're like, what does this phrase 95% confident in your interval mean? So most will say it is a 95% chance that the mean is in my interval.  Isn't this is not the correct interpretation. The reason is your interval is some fixed thing you is some pics to thing.  When you talk about probabilities you need something to be random.  Okay, so if you have to fix today was either Muse in there or still tied up, there is no probability about that.  The correct interpretation is that we put we built this confidence interval process.  And it's one of the infinitely many things that could have happened in the universe. And if you look at all those infinitely many things 95% of those intervals would have been green colored and captured Mew and 5% of them were the Unlucky ones where you got a weird sample until got a weird xbar and so you got a weird interval. It doesn't capture Mew.  But I never know if I'm a red or green in life.  I just know I'm an interval in the process. I was born out of it designed to work most of the time.  Okay.  Let's skip Socrative and try this.  You asked what's his 95% all about 95% is a number you get to decide on at the start of the problem and you want to say what how sure do I want to be if you were capturing a criminal? Okay. They rob the art museum. What would your number be? How confident would you need to be when you set your search radius?  8070 OKC chosen member, right? I don't know what the right answer is. You want to choose 99.9 guess what your search radius is like a thousand miles.  Okay, so you choose this number and it dictates the size of the interval.  Want to be really confident guess what the intervals going to be huge and then it's worthless to you.  Don't care so much about it actually capturing it. It's going to be pretty narrow butt.  Not a very high chance actually in there you have this tight little band that could be worthless. So there's this constant struggle. So how do you change the confidence level?  Oh my goodness. So when we want a 95% confidence?  The reason we chose this 1.96 or 2 is what I originally said. It's because if you go on any normal curve any reach out that many standard deviations, you're going to grab enough of the dots. They were green dots for us.  So if you just want to be more or less confident you just have to change what's going on here. How far you reach out?  So why don't we try reaching out a different amount?  And see what happens. Now the amount you decide to reach out is known as a critical value. The number of standard deviations are going to reach we've been using Z star.  equals 2 or 1.96  roughly  Okay. So let's try something else find the critical value. If you only want to be 90% confident you're standing on a normal curve and you want to grab 90% of the dots.  How many standard deviations mature each your arms?  That's what's going on right here.  Okay, so I'm going to help you on this one.  So first of all this picture right here and you would like to work and do this on the standard normal the standard normal standard deviation is just one.  So if I just tell you this number, it's the same thing as telling you how many standard deviations we need to reach. So you need this to be .9 let's say  So that leaves 10% of the area and the two tails or 5% in this Tale?  So you can use the table and say I need 95% of the area that we started negative Infinity students go in the table and you go look for 95% and then you back your way out of the table from this.  Okay, or you can use are and do this qanon.  Now we're going to keep working on all these skills. This should feel very shaky right now. This is a case where I think you really really should read the book. It will slow you down and cause you to really deeply dig into this stuff.  Hope you have a good weekend. "
