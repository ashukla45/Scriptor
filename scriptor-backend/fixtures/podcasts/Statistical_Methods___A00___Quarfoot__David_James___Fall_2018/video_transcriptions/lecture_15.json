    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back. Happy Halloween.  I noticed a lot of you took the time to read the lecture sides and read about type 1 and type 2 errors as you were turning in your homework, right?  Good.  So you're going to experience this more and more in school that there's not time to go over the easiest things and sometimes that's just offloaded to reading a book or reading some extra lecture slides or something like that.  So we will spend their time thinking about the hardest things.  Today is a tough day.  Because reintroduce would have called p-values.  now  This book is kind of clever and what it does it get you to think about hypothesis testing first using confidence intervals.  and then once you sort of developed that framework  You ready to try to move on to the mess your idea how to decide about hypothesis testing.  So, what did we do last time we said, okay.  We'd like to figure out about something about a parameter from you.  And what can I do to figure things out about it is going to set an old hypothesis must be very boring value from you to have.  Andrea said an alternative hypothesis.  Guys are losers that some claims are out there about which we're going to try to make decisions then what?  So then you assume the null hypothesis is true for a moment.  Okay, maybe that's a great idea. Maybe it's not the universe will show you if your belief system is stupid and needs to be recalibrated.  When you assume the null hypothesis is true. One of the nice things you can do then is you can draw a sampling distribution. So this is what we expect to happen when we talk to the universe call it up on the phone and say give me a sample.  And give me a name. That's a green. Okay, so you currently believe this is the universe talking to you. This world have green dots right and it should be centered at 50.  Based on what you think is going on in your soul.  Okay. Now you actually get a particular green. When you call up the universe and not green. Goes somewhere on this horizontal axis. Maybe. 59 is your average and from that green. You can go build a confidence interval around it.  And this is the range of really reasonable values.  This is what you think must be true about Mew.  And then you can say hey look Muse way over there outside of my interval if that's the case something is wrong.  The value currently holding your soul is not jiving with what the universe says or the most reasonable values. So in this case you throw out the no rejected.  And he's move over to whatever your alternative is it however, you got to move. It was actually inside your little Zone. That's great. You believe something the universe gave your data those harmonize keep believing in what you believe in in life. There's no triangulation to be done toward the truth because you're sitting with what seems like a very good truth to sit with  Now today we're going to do something different.  So here's what's interesting about this first approach what you're doing this you're saying?  Is the value of Mew that I think going on in congruous?  With the idea I'm seeing from the universe in X bar.  Today the logic with me sort of flipped.  That's what we're going to do is we're going to set me down. We're going to set X bar down. We're not going to the Constantinople. We're going to the shade off in One Direction. This creates an area or probability. This area right here is going to be called A P value for some number for it.  Okay, so this approach will have us focused on Mew looking out at X bar and saying it what are you weird?  Be here. We're standing at Mew in our confidence interval. Is there a zone of happiness and we're looking over me and you being like a who you're a little far away from my interval, aren't you?  Okay, so just two different sides to the same thing. You can either sit at your data and look at it Mew or sit him you and look at at your data.  If either of those is weird to both weird, so Happy Valley was simply an area underneath the sampling distribution.  under an assumption called h.  So, let's see how this works. There's a little problem is with educational researchers. Think about how do you make teaching better? Impossible? The short answer is the same sac class in 2017 and 2019.  So in 2017.  Every single person that took the final that you're population and you can 82% It was a good year edition 12.  But you're unhappy you wanted even higher.  So you got some seminar about improving your teaching.  Please exist you laugh. Now, they're real things most of them.  Nothing's I would go to.  You going to the seminar? Okay now 2009 is here. Welcome to the new year.  So what are you do you take a random sample of 50 students and you give them final exam. Maybe the same final what's the limit as many variables as possible. They get an average of 85.7 did the seminar really improve your teaching?  Now from this small little sample.  The scores went up but there's variation in samples right? Maybe it was just all the smart kids that happened to fall into the sample. Just random luck.  So we are going to figure this out. So first let's set of hypotheses be really boring. If the average of all the people that took in in 2019. Everybody millions of people is exactly the same as what happened in 2017.  null hypothesis  alternative I would be super excited if we could raise the average. I'm not interested in lowering it.  So this is a real-world setting dictates with the alternative should be.  Tell her that's always the first step next thing you always assume the null hypothesis is true. You got to believe in something in life, right? So just start by believing in the know and let's see what happens if you believe in the know, so what we're going to do is we're going to believe in this so we think the universe when we ask for samples from 2019, and we calculate the means and get all those green dots we currently believe that they should be centered around 82. We recognize there's variability and that's why we have a normal distribution, but  Was that a good thing to believe or not?  So let's go figure out exactly what color we think the universe is.  So it should be centered at 2017 and it's reasonable to say you know, what? I don't think 2019 will be any more spread out in 2017. I just think I'm going to be shifting that that's what I'm trying to do.  Okay. So here's a case where you might put the same standard deviation as you saw in 2017 on your 2018 numbers.  And we know that this is Sigma over square root of an because we dealt with the green curve enough now.  Okay, so I went and put our numbers in.  So when I called the universe, I'm expecting to get something near 82.  I'm recognizing the + 1.697 or - that is pretty reasonable also that can happen.  Next thing you do you go draw me a picture of the sampling distribution. Now if you want to get out your green markers and do it be my guest or you can just use pencil and remember hate is a green thing.  And if you do that, you should know we're centered the Assumption of each not force. Is it at 82 and you should pop down the data that you got from your particular sample.  Now is it weird to get an 80 5.7 in the universe centered 82?  It does have some spread out notice in it.  What we need is a way to quantify how weird that result is.  Now, what do you get if I ask the probability?  I'm getting 85.7.  0  that's not a good question to ask the dance is always alright the matter what number even if led to the probably still zero. Do we need to ask a different question?  Oh man question is what are we going to do?  So we decided that the probability of seeing X bar given H not assuming it's not right. So it's a given you can put it into a conditional. That's just going to be zero. So instead you ask a slightly different question. What's the probability of getting 85.7 or something more extreme?  Okay. So this is the question we're going to do now. It seems like a weird question. You're asking about things that didn't actually show up.  This or more extreme is what didn't show up, but you can't ask a question about what actually showed up.  So it's going to feel awkward for a while and then you'll be like, oh that's Supernatural.  superspace natural  So what did I just asked about I wanted this area shaded in red here 85.7 or something more extreme.  No more extreme is always in relation to what the alternative is excited about. The alternative desperately wants big numbers for this average.  Felicity students. Okay, so I shaded over toward all those big numbers that we'd be excited about and this will actually be a value.  Okay, Samaria, you get .01 5 when you plug it in. So what it means is our result 85.7 was among the 1.5 strangest possible results that we could have gotten. It's right on the low end of all that strangeness.  Basically just saw a 1 out of 100 event.  Is that weird enough for you?  To give up on the idea that this graph really is centered at 82.  How weird does something have to be before you abandon?  Okay, I got this coin.  I think it's fair. Don't you great. Let's start flipping it. How many Tails have to occur simultaneously before you like?  I doubt the fairness.  5  10  you have some threshold, don't you?  And everyone will have a different threshold with a hundred tails in a row.  You going to see a 1/2 to the 100th event, I can't be fair still right. So you have some number where the event is so weird that you're like no, I don't believe what I used to believe. I'm going to change my belief structure.  Okay, so this could be this could bury. Okay, you might need a 5% strange event. You might need a one-in-a-million event before you throw things away in life. Okay, so there's some threshold that usually set in advance. And what you going to do is compare your P value to that threshold. So hear the p-value 4015 again, we saw an event it was among the 1.5% strangest events the biggest possible crazy things that could ever come out of a thing centered at 82. We saw one of those  Now you just need to decide what your threshold is. No physical the significance level.  It's how wacky a result has to be before you throw out your belief system. Not typically people who use Alpha as-05 5% is a 1 and 20 thing.  So  does that feel weird to you?  To get worked up over 1 and 20 events.  I don't know. Okay, but this is a historical threshold. Okay, so typically that's what people compared to so if your P value is less than that.  Then you can reject H. Not and say you know what? I don't believe in it this 82 anymore. It's not a good place for this curve to be centered doesn't make any sense. The universe gave me 85.7  So whenever you throw out the null and accept the alternative people say you have a statistically significant result.  All it means is when you gauge what's going on probabilistically you saw something. So significant probabilistically. Do you change your belief structure?  It doesn't mean that something important is going on in life.  Significant usually means important. Someone is a significant person. No doesn't mean it all just means  random chance doesn't seem like it's strong enough to giving us what we saw That's What statistic least significant means? Okay. So you take your P value is less than Alpha.  Can you pass out the North?  And believe in the Alternatives. Otherwise you do not and you just keep believing in h not now again, none of this is proving that the nose true that the nose false that the alternative is true or the alternative is false science. Never proved anything is true it triangulate you toward a belief structure that is more harmonious with the input you are getting from the universe.  Yes.  So we're going to do that in a second here. Good question.  Now the p-value is one of the most misunderstood things ever.  They went to this conference of statisticians people from the journalism side 538 and they just walked around and they said what is a P value and they also do statisticians and the look of horror on these people's faces was incredible. They made a video of it on 5:38 if you want to go watch it.  Basically, very few people really understand because it's such a incredibly complicated structure first of all to probability and area under a curve. Well, which curve under a curve a sampling distribution.  Which sampling distribution the one where you assume the null? Hypothesis is true for some reason. Okay, and what are you doing with this curve, you're saying with the probably seeing my particular data or something more extreme this with this data plus means for me. So it's a conditional probability on a sampling distribution underneath an assumption of a Chan.  Has a probability or send number it's telling you that your result is among the strangest whatever percent the p is of the results that could happen if you believe in the null hypothesis.  Okay.  Oh my goodness.  Why do we shave the direction? We shade will had to do with the alternative, right? Okay, so you shade in the direction that the alternative gets excited about because extremity is to find relative to the alternative. So any of these results up here to the right of 85.7 or things that are lending support to the idea of the alternative and you're trying to sort of a gauge how good the Knoll is versus the alternative in this process.  So we will be shaving different directions depending on different settings.  If you ask people that have finished a year statistics.  If the p-value tells you the probability to know is true, which is not correct. If you ask them if that's a true statement 50% of people walk out of a sack class and think that a p-value measures the probability the null hypothesis is true. The only way to know anything about the null hypothesis is to call up the Universe on your phone talk to  Whatever or whoever whatever may I don't know and say what's actually true in this universe. Also, it doesn't even make sense to talk about the probability that a child is true. It's not a random event. Either it is or it isn't and something or entity or entities or whatever has decided science or God or I don't know something. Okay. So this is far from what makes sense as possible.  Now this was a one-sided alternative. We just dealt with so let's do a two-sided alternative. I often teach math 183 and math 11 at the same time.  Both assertive interest at classes you get the very hard version of everything.  They get the less hard version.  You're good right going to push yourself.  I mean if you drink Gatorade the rest of your life and just lay around be a good life, right?  Is the average Facebook friend count among all you?  Different than it is for math 11 students.  Let's find out the first thing I happen to know what the average Facebook friend count is for math 11 students. I've asked thousands of them.  And you get this number right here or 40 standard deviation of 283 is the fact I know about that population. So not really any population were interested in studying anymore because I already know everything about them, but I don't know everything about you.  Okay. Now let's assume that you're just a spread out as they are.  This is a thing you often doing these problems. Even if I never even say it.  Hey, we want to focus on your average versus their average. We don't want to muddy The Waters by thinking about also the fact that the standard deviations could be different. So let's just assume they're the same which could be a foolish thing. That's okay. We do lots of foolish things in life.  First thing what set up those hypotheses and be really boring. If you were the same it would be really interesting. If you were different. I'd love someone to argue why you will have more friends and then I want something else to argue while you have best friends.  You don't have to believe in what you're saying. It just has to be reasonable.  Go ahead.  Say that again.  You are nerdier have less of a social life. Hens have fewer Facebook friends. You don't have to believe that you're not claiming. It's true going to argue the other side.  Asus class you need friends in the sky. So you will make more Facebook friends brilliant on both sides of this right. The question, of course is what's logic reign supreme when you put it on the scale perfectly balanced and will end right back up at 4:40. No one is ever given that argument before I love that. Okay. So let's go collect some data and find a sample me. So I am about to assume that all hypothesis.  Okay, which means when I call the universe?  I'm expecting to hear back for 40.  But I might be surprised. Mightn't I let's find out hopefully so kind of work today. Otherwise everything falls apart.  How what's going to happen?  So we're looking for your number of Facebook friends.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay, so it's a good question for you than a hypothesis always have to have an equal sign.  So for you the interesting thing will always be the sort of status quo. So I use this analogy of like interesting and uninteresting. Not the Perfect Analogy cuz of your question. So just pick something that has an equal sign.  The trouble with the saying the Knoll is saying not equal to sign is when you assume the Knoll and has a not equal to sign. You don't know anything about the sampling distribution. You don't know where it's Center is just like I'm lost.  Uh-oh 64 what's taking so long?  You got a check, which means you need to check your status?  yummy data  Okay.  You also can't spell.  Will go to minitab.  So you can experience with math 11 experiences.  It's like Excel on something.  So first thing paste everything in give this a name Facebook friends.  MacArthur -1 you're going to decide what to do what you want to do by -1 remove. You just removed a human being I hate Facebook.  0 or throw them out  throw them out there gone.  1410 what do you think?  And it's real.  Play 14 3s system meme.  What is Iran that one?  CS nonsense 3000  change you're going to decide 3000.  What keep it's not what I would have decided we do what you want negative something.  Getting rid of it. You don't want to turn it into 0. Okay, you're making the choices. I do not have Facebook or friends.  What do you want to do zero six six nine?  Keep it doesn't look questionable to you, huh?  Guess you better know your trolls and memes a little better.  Figure these things out. Okay now we're going to use your data in a sec. But let's first do it.  And think about what's going to happen here maybe with some made up data.  Figure out the sampling distribution plot, you're mean on it and shayden area that contributes to the p-value. Okay. You assume the null hypothesis. This is where you get going going to happen. When you assume the Knoll It Centers things Suddenly at 4:40. We also just assume that you'll be spread out as math 11 was so I put the math 11 number here to 83.  Okay, let's assume that we're going to have 50 people in our sample will do with your numbers in a sec. But there's just so I can write something on the slide and we can follow along in case we are recalling up the Universe. I just called you right I'm expecting to see 4:40, but I recognize that there variation that happens in any sample, you draw so plus or minus 40 could be pretty reasonable plus and minus a couple 40s that could happen.  Now, let's draw the sampling distribution.  Center at work supposed to be centered you won't be able to draw the standard deviation on it. That's okay. It was for to keep it in your soul Now You See Me iPod 500 down. That's me. I'm assuming that what you just gave me was 500. We'll find out what it is in a second. Okay. Now when you play 500  We have a two-sided alternative. We would have been very excited about numbers on the other side also, right?  That would have been cool because then someone's logic would have won the Nerds don't have friends logic would have went out that we just happen to get 500. But okay. So what you do is you create the symmetric point over here.  So this was 60 above she goes 60 below.  Now this is going to feel weird when you do this. We didn't actually get the data 380.  But it is data that is as Extreme as what we saw. It's just extreme on the other side.  Of the mean and here we are excited about both sides or two-sided Alternatives create shading always on both sides.  Now you need to go find that area. So our can help you do this so find the area of one of the pieces and double it. So here I am doing the 500 and shading to the right.  And then I'm doubling it. So include the one over on the left. You can also do the one on the left and double it. You'll get the same answer.  Is this really a question? What was?  Volume no, because that was a one-sided alternative. We were only excited about results being big.  If the teaching seminar decreased scores, that's not that's not creating evidence for the alternative. It's not what we would believe or hope to believe in life.  Okay. So anyhow, I P value here is point 133. So now you better do something with it interpreted make a decision.  So you might say first one to report it. We got a result. It was among 13.4% strangest things. We could have gotten  13% What's that? Like one out of 6 ish?  1 out of 7 ish  Is that a weird event?  To see something that happens 14% of the time.  Thought that crazy is it when you roll a die. Are you stunned when you get the three? That's the one out of six event.  Now, you know how to think about this. So thinking about rolling a die.  You're not excited at all in the three comes up. It's the most boring thing in fact, but it's still the one out of six event.  Okay. So in this case, it's greater than .05 if you use that as your significance threshold, and when you get a P value greater than that, we have something that occurred not as often as the one in 20 event occurred more often, so I'm not interested at all. That's not exciting. We're not going to reject H not we got something that wasn't 4:40, but basically was close enough to 4:40 that we're not going to throw our belief system.  Now I did this in a recent quarter and we got .04 7 which is like the perfect thing if you want to be right near the p-value, so in that class we threw things out.  Okay inmate updater of 500. We don't think so is things out so should we go see?  Oh my goodness. First thing I have to do is calculate the average here.  basic stats UCLA's pulldown menu stuff  is what you get in math 1100. It doesn't recognize any numerical variables yet because you put all those words. And so it thinks this is still a text column so will format that and say they want their numbers now.  Okay, now they look like numbers. So I'll go back and we'll go find your average. What will it be?  Are you sitting here thinking how it relates to 4:40?  Here it is. You are three whatever 369.1  so let's take your data and throw it down here. So here's 4:40 in the center here. You are at 369.1. We have to figure out the symmetric spot. We have to shave that way and shade that way.  So we just go to our and figure out what the area is.  Is it far enough away you think?  Hopefully I don't have anything up in our that's not good to have up. That's not good to have up sure homework solutions.  P Norm 369.1  on the 440 curve with a standard deviation of  What is the standard deviation?  How many of you were in my sample?  85 of you  we can't use the same old standard deviation from last time. So we go back here.  We need to say okay. How do you figure out the standard are so we took the sigma over the \u221a end? So we need to make sure we get this right to 83.  Divided by \u221a how many of you there were?  85 * good. My memory is this I'm going to shade to the left which is automatic and then I want to double it right cuz it's a two-sided alternative.  TV I just found the correct thing. Is anyone bothered  .02  You are statistically significantly different than math 11 students. Now. All I know right now is I've moved to the alternative which is that you're different. I don't know that your lower.  Because I can't decide that yet. You can only move to whatever the alternative says the data if the data had been on the other side equally you would have come to exactly the same result it and you should be saying you're different. Not that you're greater. Yeah.  if you're just looking for less than  If you're just looking for less than then you only shave that way this area doesn't occur and now your P value is half.  Yes.  So you can see if you manipulate hypotheses from two-sided to one side. It has the effect of doubling or having some p-value. This is why you set the hypotheses in advance before you see the data because the data are going to be like Jesus what I think is going on, but you have to decide what you think is going on before you call up the universe.  Uses a calculator. So this gets into more complicated situations where standard deviation start changing and when you have two populations and you have different sigma's we're going to start studying some of these more complicated situation. So in this class right now, we don't even have two populations. We only have one 2018  or whatever is what's going on in from Facebook friends you I guess your 2018 183 students, okay.  And there's this math 11 thing that feels like a population it is but we know it's Mew value. We have completely summarized it. So it's not a population. We're trying to study. We just lifting a number from it. So later in this class. We have two populations about which we don't know Mew that's more complicated.  Then you can give him more complicated. We don't know Mew from either you or no signal from either. This is even more messy.  So we'll make some progress, but you're right. There's issues to worry about.  I can't give you all the answers of what's going to happen right now. It's too complicated. But if you take 181a.  Wake me in the winter. You will get to see more stuff.  After taking 180 a first here we go. Here is my best buddy Dexter. He's a Samoyed. That's a Siberian Sled pulling dog.  And guess what Dexter does dog therapy here at UCSD before final exams. Maybe you've seen him anyone.  No, okay. Well, you can go get your therapy. You don't need Facebook friends. You need therapy that that'll do it.  There's just something I took from my life. You're curious. If dog therapy. Will you cuddle and play with the dog for a while before exams will lower stress levels of students you design this instrument that's supposed to figure out how stressed out students are. It's just 0 to 100 scale. Maybe they self-report maybe ask him a bunch of questions and average it together to get asked or whatever.  Without dogs students have an average stress level of 81 notice. This feels like a population.  And it feels like I gave you the parameter we completely summarized all students who don't go to dog therapy. So it's no longer. It's just a number from that we're going to use as a comparison that what population do when I'm studying people that go through dog therapy. Okay. Now we can't study all of them cuz there's Infinity if you see a c keeps going so what's 3025 of them?  They said they were randomly assigned to go to pet therapy. Great. Now when you do this you found that their stress average is 78.5.  Pink flower, doesn't it?  Doesn't mean that it actually is lower the universe can give you weird things, right?  elections can turn out strangely  coins can come up Tails 10 times in a row that happened to me yesterday actually.  What's a 1/2 to the 10th event?  Okay, I tell you the standard deviation and our particular little sample. So here you go. Does this provide strong evidence that pet therapy decreases stress levels during exams.  Oh my goodness. So there's are set up. Let's try stages. I'm going to force you to do all the steps.  Right now is it the same sexual doing all the homework problems and all the exams just so you're emotionally ready to find variables.  He should serve feel like parameters. There's no point in studying and making claims about things going on in samples. You perfectly understand those.  So I need you to find a parameter for me part of that definition should be also stating what the population is.  but it is a measure of  you should not get a Samoyed if you want my advice.  hair  is insane  you've never seen so much dog hair in your life.  Okay, who's going to tell me what you wrote down?  That's the quantitative idea. What will you be doing with these stress levels?  On whom will you measure them?  I already know everything about that sample. It's encoded in the number 78.5 and the standard deviation there.  So you're just telling me to find variables for things already know completely of complete knowledge.  I need you to Define a population. That is something that feels almost infinite enlarged. Go ahead.  Which kinds of students?  Students near exams from what school?  UCSD students near exams all of them ever that are going through pet therapy. There's a population feels infinite doesn't it or  Overwhelmingly large that you would never try to sample them. Now you said stress levels? That's exactly what want to measure about them. What do we want to do with all this stress levels?  What is it that we care about for that quantitative variable?  The average so there we go. Okay, so letting you be the average stress level of all UCSD students ever that go through therapy right before exams.  Bought in at Wright State no and alternative hypotheses.  Example force you to do all of these steps every single time. It's good practice to get the infrastructure in place.  Okay, who would like to do these?  other voices  Go ahead.  I'd like to see an equal sign.  First of all, and I'd like you to not use words. The reason that you do step one as step one is so then you can then use it. So give me the no  with those comments  I'm going to people help you he wants to help way back.  Musical 281 what's the alternative?  Same use greater than 81.  I don't want the therapy to increase stress levels.  Why do we do pet therapy?  Hopefully to decrease stress levels is like people are falling apart, right? So Step 2 uses the thing you just to find a step one, but no always have an equal sign guy here. We're claiming to be super boring.  If these dogs do nothing.  The status quo if they maintain the status quo, they maintain the 81 stress level.  Okay, I'm desperately. Hoping that they decrease it. That's why we do this thing and whether they do or not is another question. So now we have those in place very next thing you have to do.  You need to find the model for the sampling distribution. When you go out and collect a sample and get a green. It comes from a universe that you believe in your soul.  I'll give you a second to think about this universe.  So when we call on someone we need to know what type of distribution it is.  Where is centered and how spread out it is?  I would like to try.  Go ahead. What distribution do I think I'm calling?  A normal distribution, that is true.  Why centered around 81?  That is is a very strong Claim about the universe supposed. I just know what I believe.  So we assume that's not right. It just happened right now.  How spread out is it?  7 / Route 25 you say so we hit the advanced good. So sampling distributions. You determine their Center by whatever. He was doing the null hypothesis. They're spread out in this is always this formula for Rutan. So this problem you just have to use your best guess of that information. I know I'm going to be asking 25 people because there was on the previous slide and the best guess I promise. Is is actually a Cybex now later in life. We're going to learn that this little sign right here is Pretty Dirty this approximate and we're going to get a little more precise, but we're not ready for that yet cuz we're still drowning basically.  Next draw me a picture of that distribution Put It Center down drop our particular data from our particular sample and shave me the P value.  If you always do these steps, you will get so many more problems, correct?  Maybe we should break up the document camera. Bring someone's work to the front.  Now that's an efficient.  Some of you were still drawing a vertical y-axis in your pictures.  I'm here to tell you you don't need to do that.  It's just sort of waste of time believe it or not.  Okay.  Hopefully you do this picture. This is picture of the sampling distribution. It's a green thing and has lots of green dots all over it hears our data. I shaded to the left why the alternative hypothesis is really really excited about small values of Mew.  Those kinds of you values of new lend support to the alternative. So we're going and shading that.  Okay. Well, how much is there right at command in r that finds the area?  If that was boring write a second one if that was boring write a third one.  Are you doing?  So who'd like to tell us your command?  Go ahead.  P Norm  78.5,  Mean gets don't say equals.  gets 81  SD again  7/5 lower. Tail gets true. Did you say equals true?  You should get good. Okay. Now you can suppress a lot of that. You don't have to say mean gets and standard deviation gets.  You don't need to tell me lower tail is true. It wants to do that automatically as a default.  You could also find the area greater than 70.5 and subtract from 1 if you want to waste time in life.  So here's our p-value. Hey, isn't that pretty?  Now interpret this and make a conclusion.  Now we need someone to explain what a P value of 037 means I don't care about hypotheses yet or what you do or any of that. What does it mean?  This will be a very difficult moment for people.  Where's your Daring Do?  I need some derring-do right now.  new voices  don't you just talk already?  Yes.  Okay, here you go with your turn. What does it mean?  This is a super hard.  Oh, that's true. You said something true 78.5 is among the 3.7% strangest lowest values. We could have gotten  3% 1 out of 33 you roll a 33 sided dice in you're hoping for 17 and 17 comes up.  Are you amazed are you like Addison really that exciting?  Okay, there we go. If a null hypothesis is true. We could only see a result that crazy 7.3 3.7% of the time.  I feel 30 seconds. Now. You have to compare to some free chosen Alpha Bell you now if no one tells you what outfit is. You should assume is .05 what else you can assume it is.  Okay. So here we're going to reject it's not we got something just too strange in my opinion for this curve really to be centered at 8181 kehrs don't want to give you 78.581 curves want to give you a do you want?  Now if you want to read about the history of this point in 05, the next side will talk to you all about that and have some cool links if you want to go explore the idea .05, but we got to stop it's time for Halloween. I got to go get dressed. "
