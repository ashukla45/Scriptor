    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back. Hope you had an amazing break three day weekend will call it.  So let's take a look and see what's going on.  So the rest of the quarters for the pans out like this.  We've got to get through chapter 5.  Which will be all about means and then we'll transition over to chapter 6 here and finally she was going to be able to proportions and then we'll end with linear regression which is chapter 7 we started chapter 5 the other day. So we're going to dig a Little Deeper.  If you're wondering what happened in my face.  German Shepherd and I  Wanted to occupy the same physical space.  And that didn't go so well.  He decided to head but me.  Wasn't very nice if you ask me.  Try to pet random dogs.  Get what you ask for.  Okay, here we go.  It's time to think about more complicated situations your whole life. So far has been won the population and within their one thing you want to study that parameter.  Now we need to move on and do what things were you have multiple parameters?  Okay, so we're going to move to two parameters and the reason you have to is because you're measuring the same thing in each population.  And then we'll think about 3 or more parameters, which is even more complicated because you have three or more populations. Not a cool thing is you don't need any new infrastructure relay.  Everything is sort of in place for the next six or seven lectures, which is cool. We'll just change a few details now, let me show me some examples of two populations. So maybe you care about men and women and what you're going to measure about them both is their average SAT score. Do you think there's a difference that would be interesting if there is then you say why is there a difference what do we do about that difference? What do we want to do about that difference if there were 100 K height of aliens on two planets. That's one way to get two populations.  average age of husbands and their wives  I think those are the same on average.  You say no some emotional thing in your soul average IQ scores of moms and dads of gifted.  Whatever, that means children.  some definition in the education literature  The one thing you might notice immediately is these situations may not feel the same to you.  There's something slightly different about these.  the last two should feel different than the first to how so  go ahead.  The first two are independent and buy you mean the world their independence.  In case you feel like in the last two there's some dependency across these if the husband is 82 years old the wife's age can't be whatever it wants to be.  You could probably guess roughly what it might be your some range so somehow they depend on each other and Technology. They dependent they're the worst kind of dependent which is known as paired. So these are the two extremes of the universe either the Two Worlds have no influence on each other at all. Like the height of aliens over here vs. Over here.  Or there's a way to match up every member of One population with a specific member of the other population.  This is called paired-samples. Yes, there are two universes but you constructed them in are analyzing them in such a way that you can tie together and put the fingers together on the hands. She really just have units.  He would be like the husband-wife unit.  Okay. Now the nice thing once you pair dated together is you don't really have two populations going on anymore that you're studying. Yes, there are but once you join them now, you're studying married couple.  And this can make the problem a lot easier by taking the difference between the two worlds.  So all you have to do is take your data about husbands and their wives and subtract across to get a difference call him. It doesn't matter what order you do. The subtraction is as long as you're consistent.  And you always do one minus the other you can also do pre and post wait here. You take some person you measure their weight then you do something amazing to them and you measure their weight after you put them in some like super sonic ultrasonic machine blows away the fact  Or maybe we have them eat some weird extract to see if it will make them lose weight or maybe gain weight.  Okay, and so hear that it's the same human being with being used in the pre and post a person pairs with themselves. So when we go analyze these data, we will just do it on the different now. We just have a single column of numbers. So the two universes joined-up you did some subtraction and then the numbers fall down if you want to analyze it's very slick. And you already know how to do things when you just have a single column of numbers. So let's try this.  Is global warming / climate change real?  Are you eating? I'm crazy.  What do you think? Yeah.  Okay, let's look at some data.  Has anyone actually ever looked at the data scientist have  So here we go to 62 random cities.  Go look up what temperature it was the high temp.  In 1970 on January 1st.  Then for the same exact 62 cities, look what was going on in 2016 researchers did this.  You calculate the difference in temperature for each location.  If that number is positive it's cuz the temperature went up from 2016 based on his 1970 number if it's negative it got colder.  I was just looking at one day a high temps subtract repeat for lots of cities.  When you do this you get lots of difference is 62 of these and here's the average difference Debarr.  So it looks like an average Andy 62 cities the temperature went up 1.1 degrees.  Are you convinced now with the data?  Okay, global warming is real you say.  FaceTime 62 cities  now obviously this number is greater than 0 which is why you're saying that  What is it that much greater than 0?  And I just be sort of like random things random noise makes some things bigger or something smaller.  So we're going to sort out.  Weather this one point one really is so much bigger than zero. It would like to start believing.  Holding in our soul global warming is a true thing or not. So why did you just make a confidence interval for the difference in temperatures on Earth they so now this feeling more population if we took it is ever whatever that means.  And you had reliable data for the high temp on these two different dates. Can you do this for every single City and he's attracted them?  Any of this huge list of differences?  Can you find the average that's what the population parameter? That's what we want to study the average difference for all cities.  So here's the parent thing now the reason these are so paired is obviously reusing the same city.  And the reason it's important here is because you don't want to compare random City a in 1972. Random City be in 2016 because they might be in totally different parts of the world. So you start getting differences, but it's just because of where they're located not because of Any global warming and if you're only going to go see 62 places, like probably aren't washed that away so places that are hot in 1970 will also be hot and vice versa.  That is average difference Debarr came from averaging together 62 differences.  And if you look at the different possible things we could have gotten from Debarr. It's an example of just taking an average from basically one population the population of differences. Okay, Siri know that that should live on a t distribution and we learned the degree of Freedom was in -1. So here is just 62-1. So here's the interval. I'm going to make it feels a lot like all the animals. We've been making take your best guess.  Patent not here. It's weird because the best guess is the average of the differences in the cities from 1870 to 2016.  It's just a more complicated Constructors all.  and if we need to go figure out, Auntie * 61  How to get the right area. Okay. So here's one way to do it. You can write a command in R 90 * 61. We wanted 95% of the area. That's the central area. So you got to grab a little on the left side. You don't care about in the calculation. They've done many times now. Okay. So it looks like 1.99 is the right answer it if you want to do this in a table. I want to show you.  The road 461 doesn't exist.  Why can't the table be better?  So just go to some Road. That's nearby. I don't care. If you go up or down I would go to the place of closer if I were you but anyhow doesn't really matter. It's all the proclamations anyway, so I just went to 60 and I said, you know what I love both tail to add up 2 .05 so that the Central Area picture would have .95 in it and you get 2.000.  Pretty close to what technology said, right?  Okay, so I just did that calculation that the only thing that remains to think about is what is the standard error? If you go back to this expression right here?  Well, what is it normally?  Normally some sort of standard deviation divided by the sample size with a square root.  So we're going to use the same idea here except when you're finding the standard deviation is not about individual measurements. It's about the averages that are for the differences that are showing.  You know Tampa 1970 to 2016. There's a difference.  Dallas there's a difference you get all these Paws slightly positive and slightly negative numbers.  Guy and you can find the spread of all of those. So 4.9 was given on the previous slide. You just have to go dig into some data and you get points 6 to 2.  Still feeling good about global warming.  That's so let's go. See let's build the interval. Our best guess was 1.1. I'm reaching out to standard deviations. And here's the interval that gets created.  In the process, this is our best guess that if we went to every city on earth and measured what happened from 1970 to 2016.  What would be the average of all the differences we could ever create?  That's our best. Guess that it's somewhere in there. Now you'll notice zero is in there.  prostrating  Very frustrating we're 95% confidence thing. We're trying to measure is in there. And if zeros in there you have to accept the possibility that the temperatures have not changed between these two times and it doesn't prove global warming is true doesn't prove it false. You never prove anything in science.  I would just be triangulated based on this data set to be like I don't really know what's going on. Maybe I'll go collect some more data. I mean here all you care about is whether zeros in the interval or not.  Okay, so you're getting stuff on both sides of the interval. Most of the interval is actually in the positive zone. So maybe a starting if you love global warming maybe starting to believe in it a little more.  And if you don't believe in global warming, then you're noticing that there's some negative possibilities.  Okay, so don't get all emotional just go collect more data and don't make a decision based on 62 cities and some data set. The global warming data is actually incredibly robust in Spanish thousands and thousands of Journal articles. Like that's why you believe in something cuz a thousand pieces of data triangle 80 towards something not because of this crummy study that I intentionally designed and made up the numbers so that it would include 0  are you okay?  I don't know couple Woman's real cuz I'm not a scientist.  But I trust people when they tell me things.  So, okay now I'm through all those pesky conditions. Can you actually do all that stuff? We just did you really need the sampling distribution to be a t distribution. Well, what does that require? So the only thing that's going to change here is that our data analysis happened on differences rather than just single data points. So you need the differences to be independent. Once you pair your fingertips together, you need to Pinky's have nothing to do with the ring fingers have nothing to do with the thumbs and so on.  Okay. Now you can do randomization in less than 10% to get this usually and nearly normal. The difference is if you looked at all the possible things you could ever have up in the population better be normal, but you can't even see that. So you tend to look in your sample of your 62 cities and just say to those look roughly normal and it's okay if those don't even look normal as long as you're pretty big sample size, so 62 feels pretty good to me. So I feel pretty good about running this.  What would it mean to break Independence on the paired units?  So there's lots of ways to do that. So here's some examples.  choosing married couples that go to the same church  dinosaur hear these couples bring them together, but they all go to the same church. So maybe the patterns you see in their differences will look similar for some reason.  Maybe at the church that only lets people in if the difference in age is less than three years. It's a church that doesn't believe in great age differences for some reason it could happen, right?  So that would be a problem with Independence doing before and after experiments on college students.  To hear you pair with yourself don't know how to do that.  So why would college student a look similar to college student be when you look at the differences and whatever you're doing.  No one knows. It's helpless.  Go ahead.  Okay, so let me repeat an ad. Let's say what you're going to study is if I give students this like intellectual Aid maybe it's like a calculator. Maybe it's some like a sheet of equations, you know, and they do better on an exam. So you have them take the exam once and then you like having take it again with their sheet of formulas. Okay, so, you know that they called students like there's a Bart even get in right? So there's some like General level of intelligence that everyone has so maybe that General level of intelligence is good enough or they can I take a sheet of formulas and just apply it even if they have no idea what's going on. So they'll respond similarly.  Okay, Billy thing like maybe some weight loss study. Like everyone here is basically between 18 and 24 and your body sort of respond. Similarly to thing. They my body doesn't respond like your body cuz it's all busted up and old.  So if you like trying to figure out if your drug does what it supposed to do like if a response as well, so we'll be because you're the same age and all this other stuff.  Everything still works? Okay picking cities in our temperature study that are all in the same latitude.  So maybe global warming only happens on like this band of the Earth's but slightly higher up. It doesn't  I don't know. Okay, so then it wouldn't be independent anymore. Let's do another one. I love this study to be a hypothesis testing the actual data.  Does the average IQ of parents of gifted children? This is a very fought over definition and the academic research. What does it mean to be gifted a some people don't even like the existence of such labels. Let alone how one would even to find such a thing super complicated. But anyhow, so let's say you have some definition then you just agree to use it for the study showing people went out and collected a simple random sample.  They found 36 students and said we don't care about you. We care about your parents and all their parents were heterosexual couples.  And they just said what's going on with Mom's IQ. And what's going on with the dads?  So here are the results.  Mom's average IQ. 118 dad's 114  Play date.  Here's the average of the differences.  Turns out that's just the difference of the average is.  Can I hear some spread out what's going on with Mom's but I would dads.  That's not just the sum or the difference of what's going on in the standard deviation columns.  Turns out there's no way to get this number right here, but to actually calculate the standard deviation.  of the big list of differences  Okay, there's some Independence going on between these two the mess is all the calculations up. These have to be the same size as Mom. This will always be the case. Someone way to decide if data are paired is to look for those numbers to be the same now doesn't guarantee they're paired. You can just have two worlds and just randomly chosen to sample the same amount of aliens from Planet X is y  But if these numbers are different, you know, it's never paired.  And later you have to decide about paired versus not.  Okay, now should we run a study? First of all parents were supposedly randomly chosen?  And when you look at what's going on with the individual difference is each of these little blue bars here cuz he's full unit of area represents like a particular mother father and their difference and IQs. Okay. So those are looking pretty normal. It's not perfect. But the fact that were using 36 makes me feel pretty good that the sampling distribution which we can't even see.  It's going to be a nice T distribution.  again, the goal is to get the sampling distribution to look pretty  A t distribution you need the population. Would you can't see to be nice but you see through the sample and if it's not nice, it's still okay. There's a large enough sample size. It'll make the thing down there beautiful.  Okay, I'm ready to do stuff. So let's form some hypotheses be super boring.  If the IQ of moms and dads were equal or equivalent lie, when you look at the difference that that average will be zero.  And I would be super excited about.  a two-sided alternative probably  so someone argue why the mom should be smarter than the dads or vice versa. You don't have to believe in what you're saying. It just has to be reasonable if we can argue both sides. We can form a two-sided alternative.  Who's smarter mom's or Dad's?  Why?  You've taken lots of IQ tests.  Okay, so your argument sort of wind?  Men get exhausted with Annoying stuff women are persistent. So they'll do better on the test because they persist this actually is a thing in the research literature.  Women tend to persist on tasks more than men for whatever reason across lots of different kinds of tasks.  So they're going to score better.  You can also do this in a classroom just like who will hold on to their exam longer if it's actually finish a bowl and say 15 minutes and you give him 50.  Okay, so the women I just go higher the moms someone give me the alternate reasoning.  Verydice, do you have to be quite careful what you're about to say, don't you? Go ahead.  Men are more decisive.  women will second-guess themselves  Okay, back it up. Exactly. I don't know could be true could be not. I have no idea.  Okay, try.  Okay, let me let me rephrase that a little.  Every society has traditional gender Norms whether you agree with them or not is a totally different question often in America. Historically women have had more responsibility with family and housework. Is this what you were saying? Sort of lost men have more time to study for things.  basketball score higher  okay, I have no idea if that's true or not and also seems incredibly like something but it's it's some line of reasoning like whether it's true or not is a question whether it's like misogynistic or not is a question whether it's  okay weather is changing or not is a question. I don't know so we have arguments on both sides.  Now some argument with Will went out and the data suggested the moms had higher IQs.  Now here's another one for all you ology people.  Maybe women pass more of their genetics around intelligence.  Two children then dads do for whatever complicated genetic and epigenetic reasons. So if the kid is super smart.  Maybe it's because the mom is super smart and that's where you got it all from or maybe the dad passes more genetic information.  I don't know but this would definitely like be if you're in another kid smart, whatever gifted something.  That could explain either the mom or dad's or being higher sometimes a single reason could work for both.  Yeah.  Okay, if you're just interested men being smarter than women then that's what you study.  Yes, but here I am purposely cuz I know it supposed to be two-sided.  Making us go through all of this unless I forgotten and this is really one-sided and then I'll seem really embarrassed in 2 minutes.  But yeah, if you wanted to study something else then you would set up a one-sided but sometimes you'll see me do this all the time if I want to make it seem believable that someone would care about those sides as long as you can argue reasonably both sides.  Then that's a good reason to do a two-sided alternative. But sometimes I like you only care about one side.  And then you started one side. Okay enough talk talk talk. So here we go. First thing you wanted to run a hypothesis test and you're going to do two sided. Well your value D. Bar is going to live on some crazy T distribution and you should get yourself to the standard version of that teaches tribution.  You always hurt the same way Subtract with a t distribution is centered. Well, if you believe in the null hypothesis.  You're expecting to get something near zero. Okay, so I subtracted It Center and I divided by standard error. You can see me at the top finding the standard error. It's just the standard deviation of all the differences you observed / \u221a how many things were in your sample? So I got 1.25 so we get this number 2.72.  And now you go put that down on the standardized t-distribution the one at 0.  Can you shave both ways because I wanted a two-sided alternative. The reason I wanted to decide it alternative is because of I wanted to reinforce what kind of conclusion that can be drawn. Okay. So here's our two-sided alternative. We showed those areas P value is super tiny first thing is if using .05 is your comparison level your significance level, then you reject the null if using .01.  He'll keep.  the Knoll  so you really see a way that you could manipulate the findings to be whatever you want just doing the different significance level.  And people do this all the time believe it or not.  Okay, so you've chosen something?  So what's that you chose .05 is your level in advance? You should always do this in advance. So not case you would reject the null now. What can you actually conclude?  If you're rejecting the know it's cuz you're moving to the alternative Indie alternative just says I think there's a difference in men and women. I don't know if it's positive or negative. So I think that the true average should not be zero.  Now if you look at our day to hear the moms look to be a little smarter than the dads in this sample, but you can't conclude that. You shouldn't move to a one-sided alternative.  When you were doing your study, you based all the infrastructure around a two-sided alternative.  So when you reject a null you move to the two-sided alternative now that some data are here and now that your data scientist you could be like hey, why don't we test if moms are smarter than dads great now get a new sample of data. You can't use this existing sample.  Because if all you do is look at data form a hypothesis use the data could confirm it is in all that happens in life is your triangulate toward whatever those days I say and you can triangle a deep deep into it.  You need to keep drawing new datasets if you want to see how robust your hypotheses are and if they actually match up to the universe.  Okay. So if you're ever asked to think of logic on both sides say on the final exam and you'll notice there lots of possible answers, but you should put something down. It isn't sensitive. That is somewhat reasonable. And yeah, this is hard. You just have to think about life.  That was a tough one to just come up with stuff.  That doesn't mean you believe it also.  Now, what do you do when you don't have paired data, you really have two worlds in each world. You need to draw sample. There's no way to bring them together and start subtracting there might even be a different number of data points in the two. You can't even subtract. What you going to do if I've dated points here in a hundred here. I don't know what to do.  Okay. Now this is frustrating because we don't know the stuff in the cloud.  And when you draw your samples you have all these different things you have the average from your first sample X1 bar and have spread out of the first sample. And the first one has some sample size N Sub 1  Which could be different than ends up to in the other sample?  If it's information now, if you just cover one of your eyes like at the optometrist.  Then you know what's going on in one of these universes.  Leica X1 bar it could very and it varies according to some T distribution.  This is a sampling distribution. It tells you how X1 bar could turn out if you do lots of samples from population one.  You know, in fact what curve it should be on a t distribution with N Sub 1 - 1 degrees of freedom.  You know, it's going to be centered at whatever is going on in population one. That's musiv one.  And you know how spread out this world is as someone over the square root and the same things happening over here on the right side with a bunch of to subscripts.  Now it's too complicated usually in life to try to study two universes that have variability.  So what we're going to do is bring them together now, they don't pair up when you bring them together.  We're just going to bring them together and hear what we're going to subtract.  Are the X1 and X2 bars before what we were subtracting was a particular husband age and his wife's age. We're subtracting at the observation level of these people, but now we're taking the samples averaging together and subtracting the averages that's a number and it drops down into this space right here in the middle.  So you could imagine doing this a lot of times take a sample from each. I'm the average track the averages drop it into a big puddle.  It starts to pile up and you get some shape in the center here. So I just need to know what exactly it is where would be centered and how spread out it would be and if I knew that then I would have one object.  And I could study what was going on on that one object.  So first thing if you take two independent random variables and they're both T distributions and you subtract them.  You basically get another T distribution. Which one? Well, that's actually super complicated.  But in this class we're going to say the one you should work on is the minimum the smaller of and 1 - 1 and then 2-1.  Now the actual value that goes here is a horribly complicated formula the textbook I think puts it in a small tiny margin and says, please don't look at me and it's even more complicated because that weird horrible formula that I'm not showing you can return a d f value that is not an integer.  What?  So then you have to generalize the t-distribution to non-integer degrees of freedom for us. We'll just use this.  Gentler approximation approximating so many things in this whole process that hopefully just another tiny one won't bother you.  Okay. Now let's go take our two things going on. We have these two things and they're both T distributions hex bar, and I'm calling as Y Bar if you want you can say x sub one bar and XM to bar.  But I didn't want to have too many exes all over the place these 2D distributions. So when we subtract them that's a new random variable and you can figure out where it's centered or just attracting the centers of what's going on. This one wants to give you a value, New Ulm you one just one wants to give you something near Mewtwo. So when you subtract them, it probably wants to give you something near me 1 - me too.  Also, you know things like the expected value of the subtraction of two random variables is the subtraction of the two expected values, which is another way to prove you gave me 1 - Mewtwo now if you want to spread out this weird subtraction object is you can go back to our formulas. If you want to standard deviation. It's a square root of a variance. If you want a variance of two things are being subtracted. It's the sum of the variances.  So you can see me doing that step right here.  At - got turned into a plus Miracle now how much variation is going on in this xbar universe? Will you can come up here and you can see what a standard deviation is so you could swear that.  And go plug it in.  both in the first distribution and in the second  So this now we have figured out what's going on in the middle of those two pretty T distributions When you subtract them.  And so this will be useful if you want to make confidence interval what's going on now? Originally we had one population and we just tried to study it originated through a little sample and you found what was going on in your sample and then you padded it.  Now originally we used the normal curve member that V-Star back in the days when I was just sort of lying to you and then we got a little more precise with the T distribution and goodness to some degree of Freedom nonsense here.  And the standard are not sticking over route in. Standard deviation / sqrt event.  And then we talked about what happens when you're paired data at the observation level. You can subtract things and do that for each pair. I know you have a lot of differences and those are just like numbers and can act just like the top one.  Except the numbers are representing differences. So I don't like the X bar i r i t bar.  And there's anybody freedom and there's some spread out notice of what the D bars look like it is what if you have two different universes?  Okay, there's no way to subtract individual Opera observations anymore. Cuz there's a paring across your universe's alien one on Planet X has nothing to do with alien one on planet why so we decided to subtract the averages?  Those are things you can subtract.  Okay. So again take your best guess of what's going on and then Pat it. So we need some he's cases. It helps to know how spread out things are and the degree of Freedom. So the first to act the same and the bottom one here, we just discovered the formula for the standard error.  It was the square root of the squares of the standard deviations going on in each world and this particular T distribution was the minimum.  The grungier of the two curves that's what we decided to work on a minimum of + 1 - 1 + 2 - 1 so same architecture basically just a little details change in the first at the top you're looking at individual observations. What is your weight? What is your weight? What is your weight all average them?  Guy in the next one down. We're looking at differences. What's the difference between your weight before and after the drug and jurors and you're difference. I'll average the differences.  And the last one it's like let's go out to a bunch of people in that world a bunch of people in this world average them subtract them.  That's X1 bar - X2 bar and let's study how that varies and let spatter answer by a little.  So same architecture.  Oh my goodness.  So one of the challenges are going to face now you'll notice.  Is there to figure out which is the appropriate Choice here? Am I just getting a dataset or my studying two things that are paired or are they just independent universes?  And then break out the right tools.  Okay, let's do an example here this one of my favorites in the entire course. Is it probably my top three of what we do here.  forensic statistics  This is the use of Statistics to solve questions around criminal justice or exploratory analysis of something. So, here's Mark Twain. You probably read some books by good old Twain born Samuel Clemens.  Now here's an interesting about Twain. There was this thing called the Civil War and we don't know where Mark Twain was during the entire Civil War. Now. This is not uncommon for people who didn't want to participate in the war. They just vanished somehow.  But during the war is interesting letters came out.  by someone named quintus curtius Snodgrass known as the stargrass letters and if you read the Snodgrass letters, they feel a lot like Mark Twain's writing which is pretty noticeable if you've read a lot of Mark Twain,  So someone hypothesize that maybe qcs was Mark Twain who is publishing not using his real name during the war?  The name seems so crazy with anyone be named that quintus curtius Snodgrass. Like if you were going to take your Mark Twain and your name to troll Society.  Seems believable. So was Twain the real author of The Snodgrass letters. Now the forensics are here is based on something called author profile Theory when you read an author.  There's a lot of things that are consistent in their writing.  from one novel to the next one letter to the next  what kind of words they use how many words are in each of their sentences?  What percentage of the words that use? Our three-letter words like duh and Aunt  does anyone know an author who uses lots of three letter words?  There's a very high three-letter word percentage.  Dr. Seuss  children's authors would be on that list. That's awesome. How about any like adult authors?  Where the English Majors?  different School  Yeah. Going to take a right.  Hemingway  The Old Man and the Sea  The title is all three letter words. This is Hemingway's like call sign language should be simple and clear. You don't need big words. And this like the beauty of the old man in the sea the story. Anyhow.  So are two different worlds, although they might be the same, but I don't know.  All Twain's letters ever the thing. I want to measure is what's the average three-letter word percentage.  In Twain's letter. So take a letter count all the words then count the ones that are three letters in Mike's that's a percentage.  Do it for another letter do it for another letter all the letters?  Average it that gives you Mew.  That's weird is this is actually an average. It's an average of percentages, but it's still an average lots of those.  Please have a three-letter word percentage average of all together. You would get Mew if you did it for all of them. Now. We can do this for all of them because some letters may not be printed. Some may have been lost. Maybe you get exhausted and don't want to do hundreds and hundreds of letters. Maybe just want to do a few. Okay, so you can draw a sample from each. So here's some data.  On the left a bunch of things and better known to be by Mark Twain bunch of letters. You want to compare two novels two letters. This might be different and how often do you see three letter words in nose and on the right here or quintus pretty Snodgrass has 10 letters and those proportions.  Tommy's Ex Fort Wayne and wife or Snodgrass? So we'd really like to know what would happen if we looked  on all letters, but we can't  so we'll just use some of the letters. So first thing right eye hypothesis.  Someone tell me what would be super boring or  at least something that we could maybe not super boring to you, but it said something up that allows us to function.  Go ahead.  There's no difference in.  the difference in average percent  Okay, good if you were to look at all letters from both.  people  I don't know if they're different. It's a one way to say there's no difference is to say the difference is zero. You could use this as your Knoll.  The other ways to say Mucinex equals Mew Supply.  The most people will frame it in terms of the difference and the reason is because we eventually are going to deal with differences in all this analysis is about differences, but I will sometimes do this and I will sometimes write new Excuse me while I noticed about population parameters.  And now you would definitely have two unknowns. We never had that before relay.  Their first moment. Okay alternative. I don't care if quintus is higher or lower because either one of those would suggest there different human beings now, it's possible that the average is of equal and they're still different human beings.  Random chats we just use three letter words the same amount.  But if they're different that's sketchy. It's very hard for the same human being. Two different styles. We've got some data and find X bar- Y Bar what sampling distribution does it come from?  What kind of curve is it?  It's hopeless.  We got four minutes.  You going to burn them all sitting here?  Normal, we left that ideal pretty Universe a week ago at your hint.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  DF what kind of curve has a d f o i t distribution I agree. Yes. And what will the FBI? That's exactly what I want to know.  You say 8 I don't know. Let's advance to slide and see I got seven.  Okay set the T distribution and if the count of how many things are there and how many things are there? We got eight and ten. You got to subtract 1 from each and then take the minimum. Very good. You had a no Bob off by one Boo Boo or nobo off by one error.  Okay. So let's go to Our Endless type all that in in this figure out. What's the average in the left column? What's the average in the right column? How spread out is the left and how spread out is the right? Here's the numbers.  Now don't get too excited.  obviously X Bar & Y Bar different  but are they so different?  That we want to rule out random noises the reason for their difference.  Or they close enough that Randomness could be responsible for the difference. I see between 23 and 21.  That's what all the statistics I was fancy infrastructures trying to figure this out next. I want to move over to some distribution and shade some areas or do something. The question is. What's the one important number? I need to put down on the horizontal axis.  That's called the t-stat running out of time. I better tell you.  So look at the different you're seeing in your two samples.  Subtract what you think would be super boring.  And divided by the standard error. Now this is tricky because this curve  Is one of these weird differences of two t distributions, so it's spread out in this is the square root of the differences going on the spread out mrs. V's individual worlds swearing and then adding that together with a square root a this is the one number that I really need to look at that's going to dictate this answer to get 3.708. It means we've observed something that's 3.7 standard deviations away from the zero.  That's pretty weird to see something that far away so you can go and you can plop that number down on a t distribution. You told me what he just abusing it was going to be shade both sides cuz it's a two-sided alternative and then make a decision about whether you're going to reject or keep the Knoll the author's appear to have three different three-letter word percentages, and hence.  Might be different people or maybe Twain was just in a weird mood during the Civil War and ropes things differently.  I don't know. Okay, we are stop. Have a good one. "
