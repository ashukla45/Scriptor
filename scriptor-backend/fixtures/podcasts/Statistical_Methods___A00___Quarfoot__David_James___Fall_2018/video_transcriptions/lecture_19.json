    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back. Happy Friday.  I bet you're all looking for to the 3-day weekend as am I I will not see you on Monday. I will not be here at school. There will be no office hours Etc. We will all take a little time to relax.  Including me it's hard giving a TED Talk 3 times a day * 3 days a week * 10 weeks.  Okay.  Here we go.  We're in the home stretch now 5 6 and 7 chapters 5 6 7 you have all the foundation and in truth. You also have almost all of the tools. We just need to put things together in certain ways. So the first thing we're going to do is  Go up to 30,000 feet and make you realize what's coming. So we're going to think about means in chapter 5 proportions in chapter 6.  And will always start with the easier case and each of these will just try to study one population that has one parameter that were excited about and will do inference that is will build confidence intervals for one hypothesis test, then we'll move to the hardest thing of two populations.  And then we'll repeat for proportions.  That's it.  Now the only thing you need to know in order to do all of this has to do with the sampling distribution when you start drawing samples, so you're excited about what does it actually look like? Well, you know the answer already when it comes to me we discovered that the sampling distribution loves to be centered at the True Value, but there's some spread out in it and it depends what's going on up in the population and it depends on how big your sample is that sad when she might feel like we already done the top branch and that these damn had plenty of questions about means one population confidence intervals and hypothesis test.  The trouble is I wasn't really telling you the truth back then and the situation is actually a little more complicated than what we were doing.  Uh, oh.  So what really happens in life?  Whenever you draw small samples, which is a lot of the time for people.  Or if you're studying a population where you don't know Sigma?  That's basically everyone always.  It turned out that there's something that better approximates the sampling distribution than a normal curve and it's called a t-distribution. So here's a picture of the t-distribution. It's here in blue and you can see what a normal curve looks like at the dash. Of being here and read.  They look quite similar. Don't they?  Do we really need to get some super complicated thing just to be a little more precise in life.  Well, you do care about this. If you're deciding whether you're drug should be put out into the market and whether it actually does anything or kill people so you noticed it all the time and all those problems.  I never actually told you Sigma really right and we would always just use the standard deviation we got.  and the sample  and that would be a pretty good approximation for Sigma what the problem is.  We're trying to approximate Mew. So you're usually doing from me. Right and if in the middle of that approximation you make another approximation that is replaced Sigma with a standard deviation.  You made the problem a little dirtier. And so the T distribution is something that reflects the fact that in the middle of an approximation you made another approximation just to make the first approximation.  Intimately quite complicated when you study this it took me years to finally pieces altogether. Okay. So the t-distribution it looks a lot like the normal you noticed an important difference is it has thicker tails the blue curve is higher way off to the left and right the thickness is the height. So anytime you do anything that's around pee bellies which involves shading to the T distribution will give you bigger numbers cuz the tales are taller so it tends to make you be more conservative.  Cuz big p values keep you with what you believe in life where small BP values you throw ideas out and move to new ideas.  So the question now that you've seen two things and one was the old truth and one is now going to become the new truth is when should I use what and the easy way to answer? This is you should just always use the T distribution from now on now that you know about it in life. You will basically always use the T distribution. There is some incredibly rare cases where you get to use the normal distribution.  But these are mostly theoretical exercises that these appear in the real world. You never actually know Sigma to always make that approximation in the middle of your work approximating, Mew.  I have never actually use the normal distribution on any real Thai problem in my entire life. In fact, you almost can't even do it in our  You have to do it all yourself, but in our there's all natural ways to do and deal with t distributions that we're not going to use the normal curve anymore. The teachers person will give us more precise results is a simple way of saying this now the trouble the t-distribution in the reason we didn't introduce it earlier is it itself is not just one curved but a family of Curves.  What?  Why can't you be easy and simple? So here's some pictures of different T distributions. And if there's different members of this family have something to index them by or keep track of them and that's called DF withstand 4 degrees of freedom.  It's best right now. Just think about it as some indexing variable like a subscript on a sequence. Maybe don't you keep track of what term you're on now, you'll notice that at the degree of Freedom gets bigger and bigger the T distributions tend to look more and more like a normal curve.  Okay. So this is the normal is like the beautiful perfect approximation at the end of the universe of what the T distribution is going on.  So let's try some little problems here and see how they go.  How much area is to the right of -2.6 on this weird curved T sub for?  How to do this you first just drop picture of the t-distribution you're going to draw something that looks just like a normal distribution.  You put negative point six down and you'll say to the right cuz it told you.  Now in order to figure out the area we're going to need the computer or going to need some fancy tables.  Okay, the same schools before right just when we go to the computer will go to a different function instead of P Norm you go to PT.  30 is how you do stuff around the t-distribution. So here I said negative point six you noticed suddenly now you have to tell it which particular distribution you're on your side to do the same thing for the normal, but when you're doing the normal distribution you were saying where you sent her to help spread out. Are you?  The t-distribution is actually always centered at 0.  But more on that later, okay, and here I'm going to shake it to the right you get some answer. You can also do it the other way to get some number. So everything sort of works the same but the whole point of this problem. You don't need to reinvent any Machinery to do this.  PT is equivalent to P Norm. You lots of the other members of the quartet d p q r  let's try another one. That's a good the other way what percent of the T6 distribution is more than 2 units from 0.  Taylor straw T6. It's a different member of this family known as I just drew something that looks like a normal curve. They all look indistinguishable be indistinguishable. Basically, the only difference is Tiny things in their tails.  Okay to use more than 2 units from 0 to Pi zero. I went either way cuz it doesn't say which way you care about and now we just need to find.  There was two areas there. So one way to search to find the area in the left and double it and I'll tell you what percentage of this curve.  Lies more than two units away so you can send me answer 9.2%  Now if you're super aware of what's going on in life.  He'll say.  What happens on a normal curve? How much area is roughly Beyond Two?  Standard deviations are units or whatever on the standard normal.  10%  5% 95 is within so 5 hours without okay. So that would be 5% So I told you these things have thicker tails and you can see it right there is more area in the Tails of the t-distribution than there is in the normal.  Okay, now he just missions are always centered at 0 not possible to re-center this somewhere. And in fact, when you try to re-center it, it gets incredibly complicated to something called a non central T distribution. And when you start digging through the documentation and are about this t-distribution, you'll see some sort of non centrality parameter that you should just ignore.  So if we ever want he's a t-distribution the point is we're going to have to take the situation and convert it. So it's near zero.  And so tall certain standardized the way of the standard normal if your goal is to get to a normal curve. These are the equivalent of the standard normal idea.  topless try this with tables  Now here's where it gets messy. What you going to do in a table?  Do you have a different table for every possible member of the t-distribution family there is infinitely many that's more than the number of atoms in the universe.  So we clearly can't make tables. So what you do is you noticed that the T tables are crummier.  then the normal distribution tables  So here's how they're set up.  First of all, this is the picture in the book. Okay. If you care about one tail and a problem, those are some pictures of what one tailed things look like they're about to Tails. That's a picture and it's probably just double the one tail, right?  So how do these actually go down? So you'll notice the degree of three parameters here on the left side. So first you say what which curve am I on? Let's figure that out. And then these numbers inside the table or actually places on the horizontal axis.  What was inside the table for the normal distribution?  areas  If you look up here at the top you see ideas that look like areas .05 that she feels like an area, right?  Okay, so disabled exactly backwards on where it put puts things.  So obviously something's been lost some like degree of precision. So this table can only help you do things.  And find areas approximately. So for example was go back to that last problem. We're trying to find the area Beyond Two.  Auntie 6. So the number to should appear right there.  It'd be really nice if there were two there and we can go up to the top and read off area ideas, but we don't have that. So you just go up and you read off we cared about both Tails. So whatever the area is between these two values.  So you not going to get an exact P value out of a t table?  it's okay if you're going to be using the  Table on the exams. It will say either give an exact P value for your calculator people or it'll say give me downs on the p-value and usually just care if your P values like less than .05 you didn't care with .03 versus .04, right? So the tables designed appear to have the natural cut off the people tend to care about in life point 05.01 and then it just said well, what are the X values that make that happen and then you can fit yours into that big Paradigm and get an approximate answer. So it's a little frustrating but the other option is to print Infinity pages in The carry that around which you probably don't want to do.  So will imprecisely be able to find areas.  And we noticed last time we got this area .09 to that's the exact thing from the computer Well turns out that's between .05 and 21.  It all worked out in life, didn't it?  Okay, so now it's time.  the return to means  but this time we're going to do things right precisely.  So the confidence interval used to you be your best guess X bar plus or minus. This was a d Star right now. It's t star sub + -1.  And over here is the standard error term which looks the same except now when we use the standard deviation in that piece, I feel good about using it because we have an in infrastructure designed to handle the fact that we're not actually using Sigma.  Now, what is this T * + -1 this again is the critical value if you get yourself to a t distribution and you want to BC percent confident you draw me a little picture we put seed in the middle.  And you go figure out this place on the horizontal axis and the awkward thing here.  You might think if we have in data points.  We should look up everything on Tisha band.  It turns out you actually should look it up Auntie sub and minus one that is counterintuitive for most people and the reason for that is super complicated.  It comes down to one line and a 7-page proof that most people never read that has to do with this infrastructure.  Okay, that's why now if you want sort of some more intuitive sense, it's this.  If you're trying to approximating you it has some value we just don't know it so you go ask a bunch of people and of them.  Now the first + -1 they can basically be whatever weight they want or whatever height, right. The last person can't really be what they want because the universe has a check on the system. It demands that roughly on average. They're all going to average together to be this number in the sky.  So the last person although they seem like they can do whatever they want have to control the situation.  So you see certified the N -1 degrees of freedom and then one person sad late for us to bring things into balance of intuitive feeling. It has to do with some orthogonal projection Matrix in 7 page proof where you lose the dimension, go ahead.  No, I can't post that proof.  I can point you to a place if you want to go read it. You need a lot of Machinery. If you really want to read it. You need to take a linear algebra, 20 20c and done some mathematical statistics. Valuable this point it also there's some proofs for you like like all my goodness. I see now so clear and the other booster like I just pushed horrible symbols around for pages. And now I know it's true like when you go to prove the sum of normal distributions is a normal distribution or when you go to prove the central limit theorem, either just horrible calculations involving moment generating functions and limits and Taylor series and like the authors of the book will often note how anti-climactic these boots are. So this is why I don't do it, but you can talk to me if you really really want to see something.  Okay. Anyhow, that's why 10-1 hopefully that big metal discussion. You can remember things. So anyhow, now the standard are used to be Sigma over Rutan, but now we're saying let's be honest here. We're never going to know Sigma we're going to approximated with esta back when you do that whoops that was sort of dirty.  But that's okay cuz now the t-distribution recognizes the dirtiness.  If you wonder how this all came to be. It's actually quite interesting.  So there was a researcher at Guinness the brewing company that makes beer and his name was Gossett and we're talkin 1901 and gossip was doing a bunch of averages but he only had small little samples with like four or five beers and was measuring something about them. And he noticed that something was always just a little off whenever he would do all this stuff.  And he had some way of knowing that and he said why is it that everything is always just a little off and he got frustrated and he realized it in the middle of the steps this stigma that he didn't really know. What is approximated with sfx, and he said maybe that's not actually perfectly. Okay. I'm in the basically. Okay, but maybe that's the source of the trouble and he discovered that if he use the T distribution in conjunction.  With that thing that he was a little worried about this right here that then everything came out perfect.  Then he went to go publish the results and Guinness said we have a rule. No one's allowed to publish anything because you might give away our precious beer information with your statistical theoretical framework of the T distribution. So he said you must use a pseudonym and he chose the name student cuz it just seemed like some random pseudonym. So this is often called students teeth is T distribution, but most people these days are transition to gossett's T distribution actually give credit to the person who actually came up with it. Not his tuna name.  Okay, let's try one. Now. We're going to go and go steal. Some babies seems like a good idea.  How much does the average baby born in America was a girl weigh?  Kate is already problems with this.  What you going to do about the parents choose the gender use the sex to choose the gender or whatever. I don't know this already problematic, so  Let's just try though. You sneak into hospitals and click the weights on 12 random newborn babies.  Can I take from your data in your 12 sample, you get an average of 7.3 pounds I suppose.  And a standard deviation of 2 find a 90% CI from you.  A population parameter that will never actually know.  So first thing signed what model is the best model?  To do all these calculations on that will give you the most precise results possible.  Don't notice in his problem. I didn't even attempt to give you any idea about Sigma. I've given up on that and I gave up on that a long time ago some of you noticed.  Heather's didn't I just noticed I didn't care others noticed in came in and said wait are we allowed to do that and all of you got shuttled through the same shoe horn of what use normal for now then I'll switch you over to tea.  So we're going to go to a t distribution. The question is which one?  Kiesub 11 is the particular curve that helps make these calculations as precise as possible. Yeah, we talked to 12 babies 1st 11 to pick their weights and the 12 said I have to bring the universe and Harmony so that your average isn't stupid crazy.  Now here's a picture of T sub 11.  And what I want to do if I want to be 90% confident as I want to think about standing at the center of that and grabbing most of its area.  So I need 9 with in my arms .9 that is between 5.05 on each end. Lots of ways to figure this out technology might be the way you prefer the most.  So here we need to speak UT command cuz we care about quantiles places on the axis.  You can see me setting it up on t11 and I plowed all the way through area. I didn't care about got to air care about to end of the spot I cared about.  So here's the best value 40 * 711 but we're going to need.  If you's a table.  Hopefully this 90% confidence interval thing actually is accessible by the table.  If 90% in the middle 10% of shared by the two tails to go here to two tails and you go over 2.10 that was close.  If I didn't like an 88% confidence interval, that would have left Point 1/2 in the two tails and .128 up here.  So I guess this means on exams. I've got to choose confidence levels that are actually look up a bowl in the tables.  But something to know, okay, so there we are over to the right column and then work your way down to the appropriate row given the fact, you know should be t11 1.80. That's basically 1.7 95885.  So you can see immediately like people that use tables and people use technology or going to get slightly different answers cuz already your star values are different.  Okay. Now next thing that's the hard work. Everything else is pure formulas. Okay to break out the formula. Here it is.  Our best guess of what's going on will start at our value we got that's the 7.3 and I'll reach my arms at a certain number. That's what he Stars measuring about 1.8.  Standard deviations. Ohia run something called a sampling distribution. So it's called the standard error.  And here I feel good about using the standard deviation over the \u221a end because the T distribution is designed to counteract that dirtiness.  Now here's what's frustrating you're going to see ends in the problem right there at 12 and you're going to see and minus ones.  So it's going to get a little confusing the standard error formula still recognizes that there were 12 people going on.  The curve that you used to deal with things only cares about the 11's of things going on.  And then finally will put this in plain English for all the non quants people in the world.  I wonder what percent of the world would identify as non-quantitative.  What do you think that is?  I'm give me a gas.  He said do you think you're a quantitative person in life?  What percent of people say yes to that?  1/5  I don't know. What do you think?  I think they're good at math or Quant.  Let me ask you this. If you go any ask people, are you a better than average driver?  What percent perceive themselves to be better than average? Whatever averages?  Where to know the answer to this 1% say they're better than average drivers.  75% is the percentage of Americans that will say yes to that if people are very good at their self-awareness. They should say 50% or 50% will say yes to that right cuz that's what happens means raw fight. So people are pretty diluted. So it may actually be 50% Okay. We are 90% confident that the thing you're trying to measure in the cloud. The population parameter Mew is actually in our particular interval.  what that means is  our interval is one from an incident family of intervals that could have occurred.  Most of those intervals are designed in such a way 90% of them to capture, Mew, but I don't know about ours. Hopefully, it's a good one.  Will never know.  Oh my goodness. Now you want to know what the true value is. Do you think ours actually captures it?  Does anyone know the average weight of girl babies in the US?  Where doctors decide the gender?  7.5  If you go look at the millions and millions of data points, we have to keep this datamon every single baby that's born believe it or not. So you can actually know the population parameter if you go average billions of data points together, so ours was one of the lucky ones  A chance if we got a good one.  Okay, let's try some Socrative. Let's see how you do.  Please internet work today.  You're doing inference. That's just a fancy word for confidence intervals or hypothesis. Testing.  Means that you're measuring 1 population nothing is too complicated yet the sampling distribution.  4X bar the thing that talks about how xbar varies is.  Did you say it's not a trick question?  progress  there's two thirds of the room.  Okay, all you people that chose be stop trying to be fancy. You're always just can use the T distribution from now on done. You don't need anything complicated.  10 years from now if your statistics Professor there might be a few rare cases where you actually use the normal distribution one is when you teach it to people who are just learning It For the First Time The Others When you're doing weird contextual proof Theory  Okay, great. Everyone's on board with t distribution now.  Decide to build an 80% CI for some mean what is the critical value if your sample has 15 people in it?  c table on screen 80% CI 15 people in Sample  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, that's pretty good.  All those 1.4. She probably saw in the exclamation what you did wrong, you forgot to subtract one and get yourself to the right T distribution.  You notice how minimal the differences though?  Are you going to this?  I really 1.34 vs. 1.35. You see what we're wearing about now things in the hundreds spot. So kind of nitpicky stuff for dealing with what commands in our will find you the critical value for the previous problem.  Select all that could be used.  Not just the most obvious one.  Shabbona  old school why use a separate device when the phone doesn't?  auto batteries  why can't phones just have internet batteries? Why are we so inconvenienced?  Okay.  All the point eight people aren't realizing if you want to get to this place. You got to plow through area you don't care about and area you care about to find the location you care about 49 should be the right thing that you can also plow through just a tiny bit of area to a negative place and then make a positive because of symmetry. That's what answer C is doing now. I don't think anyone would ever do this calculation, but it's possible draw pictures to understand this. I was a worthless  Without actually calculating it.  What does this expression equal?  Let's funny. Did you get blown away?  You did.  Those are places on the horizontal axis to which you want to find some area.  What's different are what is How We Do?  Oh.  T distribution turns into standard normal as the degree of Freedom gets huge. We saw that in a pretty picture earlier 1000 is huge enough.  You didn't maybe know that yet, but I chose something really big to help you would believe so I'm basically asking you how much area is between -1 and 1 on the standard normal 68 95 99.7 rule.  That's how people are getting be.  How much area is to the left of negative to Auntie 15?  Use the table on the screen.  Only 30 people have responded.  Hey, that's pretty good.  So I have to do is realize to the left of -2 is the same as to the right of positive to take T15 here and go find to to the right when my cursor is then go up and say all I care about is one tail right now. So my answer is between these two numbers 1025 and 4.05 which was an answer see one more.  We want to do inference about means using a t distribution.  When did the T distribution actually model the sampling distribution?  extract  I think I'll get an EAS can people choose a  people love a  just because we have a more precise tool doesn't mean you can create garbage samples will try to find the average rate of people in this room for a person in my sample. What is your weight?  17176 person in my sample  third person fourth person you see like if you just ask the same person all the time. The average is your weight 170. The sampling distribution is always 170. It doesn't matter how many times I come to you and ask you.  Okay, so you still need to have the conditions that we had before the people that make up the sample better be independent the easiest way to check that randomization 10%  in addition the thing that you're trying to study better not be nightmarish.  But it's okay if it's nightmarish as long as you start asking lots and lots of people from it. So the only thing that's happened is down here in the sampling distribution will be more honest about what curve shows we still need the transition from up here in the population down to the sampling to be honest and faithful and good.  Which is what do you sing? Oh, I really wanted people to choose a thank you. It's so tempting.  Definitely want to keep those data.  People getting close to needing to remove questions now can't have that. Okay, if we're going to deal with this new T thing when we do confidence intervals, we also have to deal with it. When we do me when I bought this testing. So here's a little problem. Everything we do is going to look the same as it's always been except a bunch of T distributions will be everywhere. That's all you sure that the average finishing time of the Boston Marathon in 2000. Was this number 3.683 hours.  You can actually talk to every single person who finishes the Boston Marathon and average them together and get that number. So it's a population parameter.  You're curious of Runners are getting faster or slower in the current year.  First thing can you argue and give me a reason why people are now slower and a different reason why they're now faster. Can you argue both sides?  So that I can make a two-sided alternative hypothesis and it seems reasonable so argue one of the sides that you'd like to argue.  So you're saying people that ran it last year. I was going to run at this year than training longer blah blah blah. Well the people who ran in 2000 ran in 1999 and 1998 people that are going to run in 2018 in 2017 2016. I don't see what difference it was a brilliant idea but doesn't work.  Shoes are better.  Hens time will be faster.  Okay, or how about training and technology and everything's not just shoes its hydration. Its energy its gel packs of carbohydrates.  Now someone are you the other way?  Why are people slower?  Okay.  Do you know if a parent is we heard the word heading to someone who obsesses over my new show in life more people have walked on the Boston roads in the last 18 years hence wearing them down and it's causing slowness blah blah blah of the current Runners versus the 2000 roads were beautiful and clean.  Give me a different reason.  Louder, please.  Global warming. Okay, let me follow through your two word explanation. The planet is now hotter. If you've ever run you realize it sucks in the Heat and people slow down losing water energy dissipation of the body faster global warming. That's what you thinking, right? Okay, so I now have a reasonable arguments on both sides so I could make a two-sided alternative and it would seem quite reasonable global warming is the answer to everything, right?  Here's another slower logic than you might believe more if you've actually run a bunch of things in your life to make more money the committee lets in more people than they used to.  As you start letting in more people you have only one way to go on Talent down cuz the best people are already doing it, right?  Your Uncle Joe gets to run the Boston Marathon now and you know, he's not any good.  Okay, go faster logic shoes for logic Road degradation combined with global warming.  Actually, if you've been to Boston you realize Road degradation is a real thing. It's disastrous there. So let's let me be the average time of finishers in the current year. Now, you could actually talk to every single person. It's possible the date is on the internet, but let's say you're too tired for that. You're going to actually do some sampling. And so that the problem can move forward OK morning if the current average were the same as what happened in 2000 and I be super excited to see either an increase or decrease in x  Because it would help me decide if global warming was real. No, that's not what it does.  Or if technology makes a difference before you collect date, I just based on things that would be reasonable. Now you go get 20 Runners because that's the most you can really handle cuz you know Technologies exhausting and you find X bars 3.8.  Modesta back the standard deviation is .5 so it's probably hours, you know Marathon times.  Obviously, that number is bigger.  But is it bigger because we got 20 random people that just were a little slower.  Or is it bigger? Because there really is something fundamentally different about the current year.  Let's go find out if this number is so different from 3.683 that it couldn't possibly.  We can possibly a 3.683 going on. So first thing let's draw a picture of what's going on in the original setting. We're currently in hours. We currently believe H. Not got to believe something in life. Right? So I am desperately hoping to see values near 3.683, but I saw 3.8. Whoops. I'm shading to the right. I'm cleaning the symmetric place over here, and I'm shading to the left.  Now I say here. This is a t distribution and I'm using 19 is the degree of freedom because that is the most precise curved because of some horrible 7-page proof.  Now you always need to move to a standardized setting.  Because T distributions are set up to be centered at 0 and less you finally learn about non-central t distributions in chapter 17 of some horrible book somewhere.  And these are very very messy. So just move everything to a standardized setting.  Okay. So now this is our good old friendly to distribution that we are comfortable with and tables are made based on and in order to make that transformation you do what we always do take the points in question on the horizontal axis. What's 3.8 subtract what value think it's the center of the distribution cuz you're currently believing in it 3.63 in / the standard deviation of this weird complicated thing called the sampling distribution, which is the standard deviation / \u221a 18.5 / Route 28. Now you can convert either of those two numbers either the 3.566 or 3.8 when you convert them, they turn into negatives each other. So you've effectively  Converted the other also.  Now one day many many years from now.  You will learn that the true picture here is not a beautifully symmetric thing the non-central T distribution when it's not centered is Eros actually slightly skewed but you not to worry about all the complicated this now and get yourself over to this pretty picture and then use tables or technology to figure out this area. Does it look like enough area?  To keep the Knoll does it look like small enough. I moved to the alternative. Let's go find out. I actually calculating this now. I usually do this in or the easiest thing.  Just double one of those areas and you get what you want in life. So hear the P value is .31.  Our results was only among the 31% strangest things we could have got if the world really is centered at this three point.  683  that's not a very strange thing.  At all, so I'm going to keep the null hypothesis. You can use do not reject if you like to be double negativity, but I prefer keep.  now if you've ever wondered why some of you probably taking stop before and you probably learn like reject the null or fail to reject anyone heard this  it's horrible, isn't it?  I prefer reject or keep it must clear. The reason people say fail to reject.  It's cuz they want to put some weird language on it. That doesn't make you feel like you're saying the null hypothesis is true.  Because hypothesis testing never proved anything is true. They triangulate you toward a belief system that harmonizes with the day that you're getting from the universe.  Nothing about truth in there and people thought fail to reject would be weird enough. The people be like  I don't know but that's historically what happened. If you want to know why it's so weird. Now, let's say you don't have a fancy computer on the exam if you want to do this with technology what happens?  Okay, so you going to look up your 1.04 6 on the appropriate curve? So you're on 19 now? Luckily. This table has a 19 row.  You think they printed a row for all possible values?  That's Infinity Rose, which requires Infinity Pages which requires Infinity Adams Universe depleted for your table.  If there is not a row for what you care about go to a nearby row I don't care if you go up I don't care if you go down. We're arguing over hundreds or thousands go to a nearby right now here. We have a 19. So there we are now 1.046. That's right there.  It's off the table.  Which means when you go up here and you look for the two tails area your area is more than point to cuz the lesson 2.2 stuff is over here on the right so it's got to be more then.  I don't know its exact value if I'm a table person. I just know it's more than point two and last time I checked 1/2 is greater than .05, which is all I really care about in life.  So again, we're going to keep giving these data from these 20 people. It's reasonable to keep believing in what we believe in.  That I want to show you the actual results of Boston Marathon times.  To show you that the data scientist person can be much better than the statistician on this kind of problem. The data scientist person will go plot lots of data and explore what's going on with data and I'll see quite quickly down here at the bottom are the Boston Marathon times and you see from year to year. There is incredible variation.  And there's even a little note extreme heat led to remarkably slower time put into the grass.  To see if your data scientist that the thing that dictates faster or slower primarily is the weather outside and for you to go try to worry about whether the shoes or the gravel or erosion is making a difference is totally missing the point that the other factors that come into play here are much more dramatic.  This is one reason why do scientists are starting to become valuable because they think about things like this.  Anywho, we're going to stop there. Have a great weekend.  I'll see y'all later. "
