    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back y'all good day. It's Friday. And it's one of my favorite classes also.  Cuz this one's a lot more fun than a lot of inference pain it we've been doing for the last two weeks the trudge another test, right? So we left off last time with our last real big test.  Chi Squared and basically we had some idea on one access those got to go or cold smoking amount and on the other a different categorical variable tumor development and we're exploring what was going on. So today we're switching from categorical variables to wants numbers.  So everything we've really done so far with numbers just been measuring one idea.  Okay, maybe that is average IQ. And I sometimes we would even doing multiple populations and mighty students vs. UCSD say measure on human beings. So now we're going to start measuring two things.  So when you have two quantitative variables, we saw earlier in the class that the way she talked about them present them show them study them are different. So when we display our data, we're going to scatter plot like you seen before.  And so here's our first little data set a bunch of heights and weights.  These are women that go to UCLA score of the UCLA women's data set.  So are you get some data right now? What's cool about this data set is worse. Now recording two things not just one about each person. So a person will represent a row and the calm some of the things were measuring about them. So what you would do if you could take us to values and drop them into a picture with X and Y axis doesn't matter what you put on what axis sometimes there's a natural thing to put on the x-axis.  Sometimes it's not okay. So that goes at the point x, y or Heights, wait, so there's our first points right? And if we did this many many times we create a thought that's like a scattered collection of points.  What is the scatter plot on the x-axis you should know the language. We have an explanatory or predictor variable. So this class will use explain it to her. It's trying to explain or help. You understand the idea. What's going on on the y-axis, which is the response variable when I teach a course in machine learning then thing on the x-axis is called the predictor variable because the whole point of machine learning algorithms his office and to make predictions about things by using certain kinds of information to Britax some other outcome the response that you care about  The first thing we need is language to talk about this right you see a bug big lot of dots after communicated to someone. What are you going to say? So here's my little mnemonic help. Remember all the things that you could do.  fire department, San Luis Obispo  Sdso first tell me roughly what the form is here. If I blur my eyes and it's just some picture kind of does it look like a line. Does it have some curve mid? You can even call it a cubic equation. If you see the cubic nature, does that sound repeating oscillating feature to it perfectly lie on whatever the word issue use. Hey that's called real-world Data. They're always dirty and messy, right?  Now sometimes there's a direction to what's going on. It's easiest to talk about this with a line because a line always goes the same direction.  So if it happens to be linear, then if the dots go up you can tell me at a positive direction because the slope is positive right negative Direction and if there's just a bunch of. Turn off the Empire State Building landing on the ground with no pattern you can taste directionless or use the phrase noise if you like, there's basically no pattern to the data unfortunately Sono form and no Direction.  Now and in addition to those you can talk about how strongly the dots fit to a form that you think is going on. So here's a bunch of things that look like lines but they did generate and start looking less and less like lines as you move from left to right. So these. I'll hug them in your pattern while these are a little dirtier. It's starting to get super weak air, and then it's generating to just start all over the page.  That was frustrating is these are vague words. So you might call something moderate and I might call it weekly strong. It's fine doesn't really matter be qualitative description of fdso is designed to be qualitative and quantitative which will do in a second and finally outliers. So this idea you first saw and histograms and it was just some data pointed in the histogram put of stood far apart from all the others the same thing is true here. There's some cluster or the pattern in the dots and then there's a naughty one has a 75-inch tall person who weighs 100 ish?  Okay. I just put that person into the UCLA women's day to sat in order to make the outlier.  So there you go again vague definition. So if you look at this guy replied, it looks like kind of linear looks like they sort of fit some slope consistent sleeping pattern up, but it's not that great and other not tightly wound around that line. So I said weak to moderate positive lets me know that the slope goes up instead of down.  nothing good or bad about having a positive or negative relationship depends on which are hoping to see  So, let's see if you can do this now, you know the words.  Here's your chance.  Now I'm not going to give you the picture at first that's part of the challenge.  We're going to plot the age of a husband versus the age of his wife and some heteronormative relationship for lots of straight couples.  First imagine what you think the data look like.  Once you see it.  Then we'll go through fdso.  Who wants to go first?  Go ahead.  linear positive  pretty strong  What about the O outliers?  Can you give me an example of an outlier?  sugar daddies  There we go. That's a whole class about Larson fact. It has many things in it.  Oh my goodness to have experience with that.  Okay. So here's a picture of some actual data. I don't know what David said it's from now when you had in your head.  Where's your x-axis and y-axis integers only or did you not think about that?  Do you round people's ages to the nearest integer?  Okay, so did this dataset decided to you don't have to and you can be like what is the moment you were born? What moment is it now subtract and get some weird decimal if you want it, but there's a picture. Okay. So this has this data set has linear positive strong and no outliers, but a different could absolutely have lots of outliers.  Okay. So there we got was trying other one. All the says is the older people tend to be married to older people which basically says you tend to marry. Someone is around your age that believable and I do eggs together you both move up the line, right?  So you're not surprised by that and that's what your intuition said. So let me give me something where your intuition may not be so good.  the engine size of a car measured in liters of fuel or some other liter measurement  versus the fuel economy measured in American miles  per gallon  We're going to need a car person to help us.  Okay, what do you think?  Doesn't necessarily have anything to do with you. Okay, so you think fuel economy and engine size have nothing to do with each other. So it's caterpillar looks like noise.  Kind of noisy. Are you backing off now from noise?  Correlation. I don't know that word yet. Wait 20 minutes. Okay. So you're like everything had everything is related everything in life the questions like how big is the correlation is it like you don't know that word yet? How how strong is the association like really strong or is it like basically almost like noise pretty much soda. So you're saying it's a closer to the noise in the rear bunch of hands up. What do you think?  Why don't other word correlation your SMS using it?  All we know right now is the word association or strength of relationship.  So something's negative you say.  Why do you think it's curved?  OKC saying if it were linear and it was negative, it could eventually dip into MPGs like 2 miles per gallon and 3 0 miles per gallon in -4 miles per gallon. You tell me you can't sell a car that gets like 5 miles a gallon anymore.  How big is a regulation there's the government putting their hand in your life?  That's what my dad would say. Here's a picture of actual data. And what do you know someone has amazing intuition about these things. Are you a car person?  Here we go. I hope they know things in life in order to get stuff right now. This one's a little interesting because I've color coded some of the different kinds of cars using different symbols, but I didn't tell you what those are and I even drew the curve of best fit whatever that means through this. Okay. So now the other picture in front of you  You said negative right? You said it's curved strength. You thought it'd be pretty weak. So close to Thomas noise.  When you see the picture, what do you think about? What word would you use? Hopefully you'll say my word.  You think I chose moderate?  moderately strong  just moderate tea before it's like nothing to you and now it's like  Hey, I'm glad you took a chance. I chose moderate whatever moderately strong. I love it. That's fine too strong. I don't know what any of those things mean. So it's fine. Okay, so if I take a word, okay, obviously, there's a lot of vagueness in this right. So I just be looking for a word in the general vicinity. Like if it were clearly really strong we would count week as well.  But I'm not going to pick her up or moderate moderately strong strong super strong. Like I don't care about any of that and I'm also not going to ask those kinds of questions because they're too big to really determine anything.  Outliers. Oh my goodness. Maybe the red Plus near 1.8, 37  I don't know. It's just far enough away from the blue thing before you're like a  cancel. Vegas. So there's no good definition for these stop. Hoping to get one. I can't make this like theoretical math or everything's perfect and clean and in tight little box Welcome to the Real World with data that Messi.  Okay. Now if you're bothered by all my vague language will move Beyond it. You've been saying this word correlation.  Correlation is a number.  a statistic  that measures both the strength and the direction, but you only use it when you have linear things.  Is one of the biggest mistakes I read dissertations.  Correlation causation correlation you look at the data big fat curve.  People don't know what they're doing at all your sauce only use it when you have quantitative variables. I see plenty of people talking about the correlation between two variables and one of them is not even numeric.  And you should only use this when you have no outliers. So maybe you seen notation around this before in your life. The letter R is used for correlation.  History welcome and made that decision for you. You can use an uppercase or lowercase in the class. I don't really care.  Okay. So if you if you're ever going to calculate the correlation Optical the correlation coefficient, if you like fancy long-winded names for things then you got to meet all these conditions. You better be measuring things that are numeric so you can actually put them down in a pretty picture.  In addition is better look like a line. The correlation will decide how tightly it fits around the line.  and there better not be outliers, which you'll see some people think correlation is are the  the programming language was named after correlation.  But that's not true.  Named after the author's names.  Tip of the Hat. Have you guys heard of s before?  RCS people in the room  Can you give me the progression of standard programming languages that will all types of the Hat previous ones?  Soeda after Ada Lovelace the female CS major. So that was a Language basic alphabetically comes next then.  See what you've all heard of and then.  Chico's plus couldn't make it to the right and then  C sharp, oh my goodness.  So they went the other way from s backwards and helps it their names had ours in them. So that makes sense to go backwards. Now. I've been told you anything yet about this mysterious as you are going to tell me.  What is going on with this thing called are I've thrown 9 data sets up here. And for each I just had to computer determine what the correlation coefficient was and you can see what their values are. So I want you to back to ride what must be true about this cookie.  Based on these 9 pictures instead of me. Just telling you all the things that are true and you're going to send me all your observations.  interpretive  think about it like a text message to me.  about statistics  What's true about? Oh my goodness.  duplicate  What's true about that are thing?  I'll allow you to respond more than once if you know lots of true things about it.  Play I'll take you back to the pictures.  Wow, that was not good.  My list will have about nine facts on it.  No class has ever gotten all 9.  Here's your chance.  You could be the best class ever.  48 answers will be a lot of overlap.  Do you think all nine of my things are represented there?  Across the cheat your way into this you ready to see the answers.  Give me a lot of troll stuff to ensure.  orange between -1 and 1  that's correct. Our is strictly between -1 and 1.  That's false as evidenced by this one right here. You can actually get negative one and one parent Lee.  Thank you next Ariana Grande.  Are people being in precise used on nonlinear things shocked face?  Very good. I was hoping you might notice that and in fact when you use it on nonlinear things, you can get numbers that seem really great and numbers that see my total garbage and so it's not really measuring the strength of anything of any more like both of these are incredibly strong relationships.  But the correlation coefficient can't determine what's going on. It will mislead you about what's going on. In fact, how did it form gives positive r-values. That's true. As you can see all the ones that tend to Upward have positive numbers attached.  It can be abused very good more relation equals larger absolute value of R. Okay, as you get stronger and stronger and tight to that line shape notice like that was only .85. I got tighter now. It's up to .999.  Achieve that ideal of one or negative one train from -1 to 1 when you near the ends either large negative or large positive values. Those are really strong relationships the positive and negative just as weather goes up or down correlation does not mean causation.  That's true.  I just learned what that was the other day. Did I tell you this?  I did Google it in the middle of my  Calculus class  those pesky conditions  We'll have to talk about those we did though.  How positively or negatively the points online.  relative strength  It's Britney.  Average of y-axis / x-axis values. I'll show you the real formula in a second.  Is anything good here unaffected by scalar changes?  No one has ever said that before.  Did you look at the next slide to see the things that no one else would think about it and then type it in so that the class could win this year?  Oh my goodness. Okay a lot of repeats. Should I know what this is?  I got a thing. I'll check that in after class.  Don't do it. Okay. I want to I don't know what that mean.  Okay, good. You got lots of things. Let's see. If you got everything I can go look at all the troll stuff later more closely.  how to do here's the big list  You got the hours boundary between -1 and 1 that's done by construction. They just forcibly do that when you define the expression for our  Okay, so that's fine Direction and coded and sign you got that strength encoded into the size closer to 1 or negative on a stronger case when you get close to zero. Those are possible. You got that choice of predictor and response doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter what's on the x-axis and what's on the Y if you flip those the picture just flips across the line Y equals X and the dots are just as tight to the line as they were when you looked at it before the flip.  Okay, so that's why doesn't really matter. What you doing. What axis unitless?  Idea, oh, there's one you missed.  There are no units on the are statistic a lot of other statues seem to have units correlation unaffected by linear scale changes. That was the Brilliance when came up with maybe they've done a lot of stuff before was statistics and it can actually be one of the most important things for some people and that's why they may have said it okay if you care about measuring some idea  versus a temperature  Okay, you're going to get a bunch of data points. Maybe maybe it's like how well someone does on a test versus how cold it is outside?  You're going to choose some units for what the temperature is Right Celsius Fahrenheit Kelvin.  Yes, there are other skills to but shouldn't matter. What unit to choose right?  The strength of how that relationship should be based on that decision and it turns out that the correlation will somehow wipe away your unit choices it was design. In fact, I wipe away your unit choices, which was very clever. Okay. So, for example, you see why here and then suddenly I put 2.54 why?  Fat people learning about wine inches and then they decided Ellis think about it in centimeters instead.  It should matter right and then maybe like you had 14 for some reason all these are going to be the same you can do any linear things, which is x constant / constant or adding and subtracting a constant and you guys also noticed that you can abused it if you wish and will give you total nonsense results. It'll say something has to spit out some number but both of you as I mentioned a very strong relationships with correlation coefficient gets confused. It's just trying to fit a line to what you give it and determine how good of a line. How how well, did they to fit a line? Okay. So when it's Portugal line in his brain through this one on the left it sort of does that  And some of those points are not real strong and that line to draw a line through this.  I basically just wrote a horizontal line and gives up and like Nothing fits it at all. Basically. I mean it can draw a line to one of the parts but the other so nasty and doesn't relate to it at all that it doesn't know what to do when you have outliers and I wanted to show you why so on the left here. This is scatter plot. I made of just random noise just. Thrown in a one by one box and there were a lot of them. So it almost looks like it's filled it up. Right and you find the correlation and it just says Hey correlation 0 nothing going on doesn't fit a line.  Okay, and then I took the exact same data set and I put one outlier right there.  And I to calculate calculate the correlation there and it's okay. That's pretty good.  Okay, so if it's imaginary line that goes straight to that point and then goes down there and then all yeah, there's some real nice. But yeah, like we got that one so you can see how it gets so confused.  And it doesn't what to do when you have a naughty outlier and Nadia are totally dictates what's going on and the noise of what's really going on is lost.  Now you want to know how or is calculated.  What is the formula?  So the first time you see this it's incredibly overwhelming. I remember the moment I first saw it and I remember the emotion.  But it's like my whole life right? I got like care about stuff. So what do you do with the points? Right? So the first thing I have to do is find X bar. This is the average of all the X values. So if you took all the points and just let them drop down on the x-axis and you forgot about their wyness.  You have a bunch of X values. You could average. Mm. Okay in this line right here at dawn is X bar.  You also need to go find Y Bar if you throw all the dots over to the left side and it's a magnet that attracts them. Then you have a bunch of just numbers you can Average Joe menu get Y Bar.  Okay, that's roughly on average what's going on in the two dimensions of the problem and you're going to use that to your advantage. So what you do is you take each day to point and you looked at the x coordinate and you see how it relates to X bar and you'll get its y-coordinate and then you buy those values and then you divide it by some and you do this for every single you add them all up for all the different points in / some horrible constant down here.  Now, why does this do anything is the first question so first, let's make a point like right here is green. I noticed it's bigger than xbar and it's bigger than y bar. So when you do this in Paxton's which are represented by these distances you get positive for each of the ideas Sony multiply them positive. So for this particular point this term in the numerator is positive. So what that point trying to do is contribute to the song the idea that I think this thing should be a positively sloped idea.  And in fact, all of these Green Dots contribute. Hey, I think something a positive trend is happening now down here. These are also green and it's because when you look at one of these points, both of these differences are going to be negative so their product is positive.  If you look over here in the red ones, okay, when you take one of these points, I did the first time it's going to be positive or II could be positive but not both so you could have positive in a negative from differences and when you multiply a negative so these red dots want to support a negative Trend in the blue ones with her exactly on one of these lines don't want to support any trend.  The date of those data points don't fall to one of the sides on average are there left to right or above or below so they don't really do anything. So the evidence for Upward Trend do the Green Dots down return through the red dots  Amen in order to get the thing between -1 and 1 you just divided by something that will forcibly push it between those bounds and you just say like what what's the biggest thing I could ever create with the biggest summation. They could ever be created in the worst possible scenario and it turns out to be this expression.  That is actually different way of thinking about this. I think it's even more helpful. If you take that sfx the standard deviation of the X values to drop all the points down there. If a certain spread out in us if you take that SMX new paired up with the x minus X bar in the top you created a  z-score to Mission how many standard deviations above the X idea that green point is and how many standard deviations above the Y idea?  But that point is in total product of all these Z scores in the X and Y directions.  Okay, so it's and that's with wiping away the units right right there. You can see the units going away to that Z score.  Now I know why it's unitless. It's a little hard to show that this has to be between -1 and 1.  Benoit and -1 for the make sense like every single data point gets a stay.  and what sort of averaged together all their evidence  SM. I believe it should be between -1 and this isn't like you would help for Ender, but it's another one of those like weird things where and -1 is needed for some complicated reason and 181 B.  Obviously, you don't want to calculate this song yourself first. You have to find us a back. That's horrible calculation is Supply horrible me and horrible live are horrible summation horrible. Okay. So if I'm ever going to ask you to use this formula, I'll give you like 3 datapoints.  And you do it once in your life, but it's all computer there after yeah.  Okay, so if all the blue points are horizontal you have to think about what things are Define. Okay starts getting really dirty.  Okay, all the blue points are horizontal is Y Bar to find. Yeah, it's just we're at the height of all the blue point is the standard deviation of light to find.  Answer then you got to think like what's the standard deviation formula? Oh, that's just the sum of a bunch of stuff / N - 1 OK every number equals the average for the standard deviation be 0. What's 90 / 0  Okay. So in addition to this formula, you could say what what I want to do in the weird cases when they're all blue. This way are all blue that way. So they're all blue this way when you want to do you want to call it 1  You want it but one is a positive number which suggested it should be slipping up.  positive zero  which equals negative 0 0 is what you get when it's pure noise and it's the weakest pattern.  Okay, so there's a problem when all the dots lie on a horizontal vertical line with our but the trouble is like it did the reason it's not really problems. Cuz if you look at it and they're all on a horizontal line, you don't need to go calculate the correlation coefficient. You just like gummy it's all on a line.  So you're worrying about it, which is a great at schools. Like think about what happens mathematically but in practice it doesn't matter and it's a zero probability event also.  I've never had a dataset all lie on a perfect horizontal or vertical line. That's okay if you get one or you're going to get one as you sound examples.  You can go to this on your phone if you want guess the correlation. Com.  It's valuable to be able to look at a scatter plot and guess your way into the correlation. Okay. I'm going to try not to blow out the volume here.  Okay, this might be loud.  Okay.  So all this is a scatter plot and you type in the correlation coefficient.  So who wants to play in front of the class?  Okay, so what's the correlation on this one?  It was nice and gave you something positive. I think it always does.  04  Okay, so here's the True Value.  You did pretty well.  And you got a plus one coin good for you or streak is one right now. You have to go again now.  Pastor 28  Oh you are off by more than point one. We lost a heart.  pastor  02  Oh.  What is it?  you said that's more like going out to  we died.  That didn't last very long. Now. You can see the scoreboard the leaderboard longest streaks.  Now if your CS major now, you can go write yourself a little script in python or whatever language you like. All I have to do is just have it stuck in the picture.  Back to ride with the point values are put those into our python have a calculate the correlation have an input the value and then run the script so you can be at the top of the leaderboard.  And have as many or if you're interested in hacking things and breaking their system and getting fractional amounts.  You can practice your hacking skills cuz this site is not very secure as you would imagine.  Anyhow what? You probably just saw that people aren't very good at this.  It takes a lot of training actually to get good at this believe it or not, but it's valuable to do.  Okay, otherwise like supposed to tell you the correlation 2.6 on something. Are you excited?  If you've seen a lot of points 6 things then you have a sense of how tight those dots are and how excited you should be. Every one of them will be excited by point nine nine nine and everyone will be bored by .00 to it's all that in between and there is not sound like I can't map those numbers over two words like is moderate 6.2. I don't know what you're thinking. So now we have a number but unless you have a visual interpretation of that. It doesn't really help. So let's try this with an actual example.  Old baseball, huh?  Have you done this before?  Have you seen Old Faithful in your life?  Old Faithful is the Geyser in Yellowstone Park its use glue up into the air hot liquid every so many minutes pretty reliable and how often does this why it's called Old Faithful  So can you predict how long you're going to have to sit there and wait?  before the next eruption  If you time how long the goose paid for on the current one you just watched.  It's an actual study done by geologist. Here's the data set if you want to see what it looks like.  And all Hutchinson did was say, okay. I'm just going to go out there and like time that Interruption and then I'm going to sit how long I have to wait and there's a reason to believe that these might be related.  If the thing that spews go for a very long time, it's released all the pent-up pressure in the ground. So we'll take a long time for to build up the pressure again in order to explode out.  Benefits music very short amount of time. You solved a lot of pressure remaining, right? So that's why they decided to do this study now can also help you. If you go to Yellowstone to know how long you have to sit there and wait if you want to see two of these instead of just one. Okay. So here's what the data look like.  I know sometimes natural phenomena are the best place to go to get beautiful relationships in life. Cuz nature follows patterns, I guess something something Universe structure and I don't know but anyhow, 9th of the last eruption so really long eruptions if you get a five-minute show, you're going to wait a really long time, right?  Now in your soul, I'm guessing you already put a line through these data, right?  Did it happen in your soul instantly? Was it this line?  So the question is how do you put the best line? You can put your soul did something but we need a way to sort of rigorously put a line that best fits the data.  So first, let's suppose you had a line already down there and you're trying to decide if it was any good or not.  So for every x value, you know, I have two things the first did you have the actual y value in the data set that made the datapoint?  I'm paying value observed. But you also now have the height of the line at that x-value, which I'm calling y hat is what the line predicts should happen if you give it this x value.  Hey what you can do for that datapoint you can subtract y&y hat and it will tell you how far off. The line is for that particular datapoint. So measures the height above or below the line if the. Is.  Now in this case, do you have to make an arbitrary choice and weather going to do y minus y bar or the other order and it doesn't matter but everyone in the world does y minus y bar? So let's just keep doing that at Arbiter. Anyway, that's why there's the line. Okay, so why hat  Is the height of the line at this x-value 2.75? So it maps to a height of 63. Where is the actual date is way up there at 79 and right there is the residual it's how much resides when you do the subtraction or the residue if you like when the subtraction has occurred. So anytime you get your positive residual because the point is above residuals for low.  Does it have to do with Anova the residual?  I mean Anova has lots of subtraction e ideas also.  So yes, the difference is and Nova was taking every single data point every number and subtracting way the global average across all the different bands and that's how far every individual datapoint was from the global average. So it's the same idea except here. It's like how far are you away from the line we constructed.  So not sent a couple different cuz we built a line or going to build one shortly 16 minutes. So the line got that wrong by 16 minutes. So it took actually 16 minutes longer than was predicted. So the question is what line best fits the data and how can you use the residuals to help you decide?  So now a perfect world, what would the residuals look like?  0  all of them in fact, right, but that only happens if the data actually are perfectly on a line to start with and then I don't need you to put a line through them to help me do anything in life. So there's the perfect thing always the jewels 4 B 0  Now we're never going to have that you're gonna have some positive and some negative. So you might say what I'm going to do is I'm going to throw line down and then I'm going to calculate the residuals and every single data point in just add them all together.  And that tells me how bad my model is.  And I'll just choose the line where that expression is minimal.  So what's the problem with doing that?  negative  song with negative  Cancels out.  Positive negative and positive can come out to be zero just because you had strangely the right dicks mix of negative and positive residuals.  Okay, so we didn't really get anything they so let's try to fix this. So there a lot of choices for how to fix this wanted to put absolute value bars around every residual you calculate make more positive an atom together. Another choice is to square things to make them positive.  That both are quite reasonable people use both in the real world, but I'll tell you most of the time people use the square idea.  And the reason is if you have a residual like the number one whether you square it or take the absolute value doesn't matter. It's same as all right. If you have a residual like -10 taking the absolute value turns into positive 10 wearing it turns it to 100.  And in your model error just got a big hunk and number added to it.  And so it makes that model not so hot. So what it does by screen things are really penalizes and tries to keep you away from large residuals.  Set one thing it does and some people believe that I don't want any really really large residuals. I'm okay with tons of small ones, but don't put some crazy line that really blows one point out of the water. I don't want that and that's one reason another is that everyone knows this so you should do this. Okay, so it's like follow history maybe people had good ideas in the past. I don't know that there it is. Maybe one day you want to take the derivative of something.  You like taking derivatives of absolute values?  No, I love taking the derivative of x squared 2x absolute value not even differentiable. So if you could imagine someday sometime wanting to take a derivative then put something in a differentiable.  Okay, so there you go.  Now can your brain do this?  Feel deep down what the right thing is.  So let's try and see how good your soul is.  So let me show you this pretty little picture.  So here's a scatterplot. There aren't many data points. That's these great things. There's only five datapoints and he is currently a line the way you can change the line around if I just dragging on the thing called T1 and T2, those aren't actual data points. They just helped dictate the line.  Okay. So here you go. You can move it around don't like that y-intercept. We can move it up and down. So your total control over m&b at Michaels and expose be so the question is will your soul help you drag this to the best possible answer?  Now, let me show you an answer to clearly not right.  As you probably believe that's not very good. We could do a little better.  Now what's going on? So first of all the blue call him here. It's taking all the X values and it's a plug-in the man. So this is why hat just call him. This is how high it predicts for the different X values underneath the gray data points. If you want to see the residuals, it's those distances.  Okay, so some positive some negative if you drag it in the middle now, what we really care about is the squares of the residuals. That's what we want to think about and we want to add them together. So if I click on this it will create an idea that is equivalent to the square of the residual by drawing a square.  And it's the area of each of these things that represents residual squared. And so what you want to do is add together all the areas of the squares and try to get that to be as small as possible. Okay, so obviously some choices are very dumb like this, right every single square is big and you can start getting some of the squares smaller.  Now at the end here you can see residuals or some numbers that square them it added them up. So this is the model error.  That's how bad it does in general for your data.  so  What do you think?  Anyone want to come up and pull on them till you believe?  You have it, right?  Okay, let's change it. Does anyone want to tell me what to do on your seat?  And I will just do whatever you say with these pulling actions. It's your moment to tempt fate and see how good your soul. Is it drawing lines?  What you say?  Move P1 down how far you tell me when to stop?  Now, do you want me to pull on P2 or you good?  up a little  are you looking at the red thing right now to help make this decision or you just like  Do you think that's As Good As It Gets?  Now, let me ask you this.  If I make the okay, so first you had me pull on P1 right until you felt that was like the best it could be and then you had me pull on P2 exchange the slope do it best.  If you do that, will it lead to the optimal answer if you minimize the idea first on P1 and then on P2, does it minimize the whole cookie?  I need to go back if you want.  Oh, I need to get rid of the go back and forth.  What do you think?  Connect the first two dots what does that mean? What are the first two dots do you want to be to?  Nice to what? You mean by connecting? I don't get to move them.  Do you want to take that data point that one and that one in form a triangle?  The Wright 3 and make a triangle and the lesson you just like trying stuff.  Is there any reason why that should work?  Haha, you should be very very careful. First of all, this happens to have just the right number of points for you to use your little Theory. What if there were a hundred datapoints up here? What do you want me to do?  50/50  Okay, let's show the best fit. There it is.  Okay, so you got me down to about 53 points on thing 53.5 so you can get down to about 52.9. So it's super complicated something multi-dimensional calculus blah blah blah 20 C 20 e  Okay, but we got to stop. Have a good weekend. "
