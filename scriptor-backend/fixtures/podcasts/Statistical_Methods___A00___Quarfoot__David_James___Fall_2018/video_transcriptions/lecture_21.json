    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  I got a pro tip for you in life.  When you're trying to study for an exam.  If your class has a parallel version that easier for example, 20 b 10 B math 183 versus math 11.  One thing that's often true.  It's a fee higher-level version will always put things on exams that aren't included in the lower version class.  it helps you separate whether this class really was about integral calculus + + + like 20 b or was it just integral calculus - - -  I could some other school. Let's say so anyhow, this is a topic today that you don't get in a math 11 class and it's pretty sophisticated. And so this really separates 183 from math 11.  math 11 statistics, but it's more like this but  without the hard parts  Who takes it?  A lot of things from the 10 series take it and it's like their final math class to take they need some Statin life and most students in the 20 series will go take 183 because that's what their Majors require. So anyhow, that's life in this is stats on light heavy.  So, how big should my sample be this is a question you're going to ask all the time that you actually start drawing samples and collecting data. Now the answer to this is it's super complicated and it depends as you can see here on many things. There's often a cost and drawing a bigger sample that can be in terms of time or money.  Okay, there's a risk that you put participants and when you do a study every time I want to go to study how to create something called an IRB form. Is it really a 20-page document that goes to the institutional review board which is four people at UCSD decide if what I'm about to do to human beings is ethical or not. And the reason we do this is because people used to do plenty of unethical things in the past.  And people died because of it. So now every action of research is investigated beforehand. So you want to see if this like new armor device will save the soldiers the Marines driving in it.  Well, you've got to test it on people. Don't you the more people you test it on the more people that might die but the better day that you get the fewer fewer people died, but now you don't have as much data. So it's complicated medical trials this brand new drug cures everything, but it might kill people. I'm not really sure.  How many people you let me test it on. So anyhow, statistical in nature. Like I really want the sampling distribution to look a certain way and I like it to be normal. For example. Well, you need more more data to have it look a certain way. And then the last one is what's the downside of missing a real effect. She normally when you diet Papas testing you assume it's not and you assume something interesting going on and then the day to come in and I'm so surprised her so weird.  But in truth you actually think the opposite way you like. I think I've got this drug that works.  I'm pretty sure of it. That's why I'm running a study but the stupid statistics makes me assume. There's nothing going on blah blah blah blah, but usually have something you think is going to work and you want to see that it works. So you don't want to miss a real effect if there is one if you really have the cure for cancer.  It could be pretty bad if your study just didn't show you that even though you did.  So as a man gets large sampling distribution will always approach with supposed to approach theoretically, which is great.  But at the same time is Angus large you start encouraging negative things like dangers and costs. So the first two are always going to be context-dependent. They will depend on whether you were asking students to take a math exam in a blue colored room.  Very little danger versus I'd like you to sit in this Humvee while I explode something underneath it very high danger. Okay, so I can't answer the first two for you because it depends on what you're doing, but the last two we can talk about  And power is the way we think about this.  Okay, so long time ago in a slide we didn't get to we defined power.  So here's what it is. It's the probability of  deciding that you reject the null hypothesis that is moving to the alternative.  When the null hypothesis is actually false.  This is the definition of power. No, I don't actually think about it that way.  I think about it in the second expression hear the probability of finding an effect. That's what happens. When you move to the alternative you like to do something cool happening. I found something. When will they start as false? That's the same thing as the alternative being true. And if he was going to his true there really is something interesting going on. So it's the probability of finding or believing something going on when there's something really going on. If you got a drug that actually cures cancer the probability that they had pappas's test lead you to believe  Berry cures cancer  What is the definition of power?  Now the trouble with this is the following hypothesis. Testing is always based on assuming the null is true. So you'll never be able to calculate the power through the traditional framework of what we've been doing. We're going to have to create sort of a new framework.  So again How likely am I to find or believe? It's something interesting is going on.  If there really is something interesting going on and that is what life is really about  No sample size is tied to power.  And power is tied to the ability of finding a true fact. So in effect sample size is tied to your ability to discover exciting things in the universe.  The bigger the sample size the more likely you are to find things going on.  So let's start talking about something called the truth of the universe.  Your friend claims UCSD to national average 37 text messages a day.  You think it slower and decided to run a hypothesis test. So what Star Building the framework here first thing Define your variable. This is the parameter something you're trying to study here. It's about the population Call UCSD students two quantitative variables number of texts. And the thing you like to do is find the average of that now we could simply happen to all of your phones using NSA technology and look,  But that sounds an ethical. So I asked a few people instead as a random sample of the null here is 37 we got to put an equal sign and the only number in the problem is 37. So I'm guessing we use that and the alternative is one-sided because I believe it is it's written in the problems.  Cuz everything looks the same so far, right? Okay. So now what happens you assume the null hypothesis. That's a nextep. Here's what I think when I reach out into the universe and grab your texting information and I averaged together. I'm expecting to get a result near 37, but there could be some variation because you know random this is weird.  Kaiser this is the sampling distribution. Assuming H not and it is all we've ever drawn before right?  Now it's time to draw more things. Oh my goodness. That is normally T distribution. That's what we spent the last week talking about, right?  Well now I'm going to say it's okay in these problems that have to do with power and sample size.  You may use a normal distribution cuz it makes everything so much easier.  Furthermore there real issues with using a t-distribution if the whole point of the exploration is figure out what the sample size should be. Well, look if it's a t distribution, it's t sub + -1 where n is unknown  Do you like living on a curve? You don't even know what it is?  So we will assume when we do power calculations. This is normal.  So here we go sampling distribution. Now. This is the curved we've been using to make decisions about whether we would like at the end of it all to end up sitting with the Knoll or sitting with the alternative.  Now, how do you make those decisions?  Well, usually just find a P value and you compared to some number say .05, right? What you can do is the following you can create something called a rejection fence. So there's a place on the oars l a n on one side of it if your ex bar.  Your average from your sample if it came in on that side you'd end up rejecting the null and if it landed on the other side you keep them all.  Okay. Now this rejection sense its position is dictated by what Alpha is if you're going to be throwing things out or keeping them based on an area being .05.  Less or more than that number then this rejection and Pence actually is the place where this area to the left is .05 will spend a lot of time finding these. But anyway, that's roughly what's going on.  Now his work is complicated.  You think the universe is giving you something from the blue curve because you believed in your stall H. Not his true.  But when you go out into the universe and actually collect data.  It doesn't actually come from that curve. That's just your little Dream Land in your head the universe knows what's going on and knows the true value from you. Maybe it's 37 maybe 400 feeling texting today. I don't know.  Okay, so there's actually another curve going on that we've never drawn before here this red curve.  This is centered at whatever the true value is and only the universe knows maybe you guys on average about 31 text today.  So when I go collect data, guess what it's coming from the universe built around 31, even though in my head. I'm like 37 37 37, please.  So we're now going to draw two curves one is how we're making our decisions.  What you could call like the truth you believe in?  Doesn't make it the truth and the other is what's actually going on in the universe the truth of the universe. Okay, when you collect a sample of comes from the red thing so we should do is imagine this. Look at this red Dash thing and imagine it spitting out of value. So take some. Under the red curve have a right there and then drop it down. Okay, majan, the red curve isn't there anymore and the blue curve is making your decisions?  That's a really happened to be like the red thing can spit out weird things like it's about 20, right and then that value explored on the blue curved because that's what you believe. This is very hard the first time you see that there's actually two curves your belief system.  And what's actually going on when you call the Universe on the phone and say give me stuff?  What area in this picture  Equals the power power the probability probabilities or areas.  toughest moment in the class  Go ahead.  Everything to the left of the vertical dashed line and Below what curve?  So, why did you say below the red Dash curve in your sentence?  Okay, stop you said if we're conditioning on to affect it means the red curve is actually what's going on in life. And then why did you compare it to the rejection fence?  The rejection for fences and .05 it's related 2.05. How does a rejection fence? What does it do?  Something something something Knowles extremes. Yeah. Okay. It's complicated. Right? So anyway, the power is predicated on the true fact, that's a right curve that if it's really effect.  The universe is giving us stuff from the red curve it. So that's why you correctly said the red car, which is nice. But how do you make decisions about what you're going to end up believing in Life or not? Use the blue curve and the rejection fence. So if you're going to reject H, not you're going to be doing it on the blue curve and that rejection fence right there. And so you would just hope to get something out of the red curve. It is to the left of the rejection fence.  Very good. That was really hard. Most people don't get that right? So that shaded area right there at the power.  I just have to do with the definition of what power is and what all these curves represent.  The area under the truth curve whatever the universe really knows is going on that falls into the rejection Zone, which is determined by the null hypothesis curve.  Oh my goodness. So if you ever want to find the power of something to test your about to run you have to draw a picture like this and you have to shave this red area right here and figure out how much it equals.  Are there a lot of steps in doing that and this is going to get complicated. So we're going to choose our sample size in such a way that that red area is.  A big number if there really is something going on and you desperately want to find it. The power tells you How likely are to find it. So you'd like the power to be very very high.  Now most people in the world suggest numbers between 80 and 90% if you really have the cure for cancer.  I love a 90% chance that my study shows it 10% of the time will miss it. Sorry cancer.  But 90% of time will get it. That's great and we'll end up with the alternative because it's actually true.  So let's go try little problem here.  Run hypothesis test to see if math 183 students are happier than average Americans.  Happiness index of Americans 31 as of the last date of collection this actual thing.  But that standard deviation 12 you draw sample size 40 seems like a lot of people right? I'll just go take 40 UCSD students.  If the true happiness value of 183 students.  It's 35. How powerful is your test How likely are you to discover?  the happiness  is 35 which is more than the 31.  How likely are we to discover that you are happier than Americans  So here's how you do this problem first set up the infrastructure like we've always been doing.  So we're trying to measure something about all you want. 83 students that could mean current it could mean all ever past present future. If you want it to seem bigger and more intimate and scary and unseeable. You can just talk to everybody.  Okay, I'll keep it bag it be boring if you were just like America and  here we go. Mew is greater than 31. So why did I set up this one-sided alternative? It's good. The problem says I want to see if you are happier than that's where that came from.  Next thing after you do all that you need to draw two distributions.  One is based on what you believe in your soul H. Not and the other is when you call the universe up and collect data where the data actually coming from. What kind of distribution?  Then you need to find a bunch of things the standard error of these curves the rejection Fence location and so on. So here's a picture that you notice something interesting. So first-year in blue. This is what we think is going on.  I think you're just like American. So I'm expecting result near 31. Yeah, okay.  When I call up the universe and collect data and ask some of you it actually comes from the red curve.  Now we need to go figure out.  Be spread out in this of these curves and other things. Yeah.  Know that the red curve is a sampling distribution.  Doesn't come from one. It is a sampling distribution.  It's if you just kept calling up the universe insane give me data. It would look like the red curve you're sitting there hoping it's going to look like the blucher, but you'll be wrong.  if we never actually thought about like  the date or do they actually come from they come from whatever is actually true that this is strange because if you go back and look at what was said here, I told you right here with the answer to the problem is it's 35.  And I have to tell you that so that you can draw a red curve standard it 35.  That's the awkward thing about these kind of problems. There's this thing we want to study and I just tell you what it is. I also tell you what you think you wanted to be. That's the null value.  And you've never had this before so it's going to feel strange for a while. So first let's go figure out what's going on in terms of spread out and it's of these two curves. Okay. So we have stigma I gave you that individual people how happy they are just variation and it spread of 12 it reason 40 people. So here's the standard error formula.  We're back on the normal curve. Even if I just giving you a standard deviation in a sample. We still would have done Sigma over route in here while I was going to be on a normal curve. Okay. So that's the first helpful thing to figure out the next is you have to know what Alpha is in your problem. This has to be given and if it's not stated issues .05. Okay. So this is going to help us decide what kinds of things we would throw out your teeth in terms of hypotheses based on the X bar that comes in.  So what I did here as I did a calculation on the blue curve.  It's a sampling distribution. It's centered at 31 because we assumed that and it's spread out in this is this number cuz I just figured it out 1.897 Sigma over root on Excel spread out sampling distributions are in two by doing this calculation. I'm figuring out the place on the curve where the rejection fence would go.  Okay. So 95% of the area is to the left of this red rejection fence and 5% is to the right.  So anytime you were to get a sample value that was to the right of that when you plop it down and shave the area. You would have something less than .05.  And you would reject the null.  Anytime you got something to the left of the fence. You would flop it down shade all the area and would have to be more than .51 05 because the rejection fence is a place where there's exactly .05.  Can you show us the first thing you do?  What stings you go shade?  What would be the power? So this is under the truth of the universe with the actually going on the red Dash curve and you want to shade it in the rejection zone. So this is the universe screaming at you trying to tell you desperately that you cure cancer or in this case that you all are happier than Americans trying to give you results way over here most of the time.  And if you get the results over here, and then you're going to go and reject a null. Okay, so there's the area that's the power in this problem. So powerful your test is  Tell her to find that area. We need to go use a p Norm calculation pinot and finds areas to Norm find places along the axis. So the rejection fence will always be a qanon calculation and this will be peeing on no notice. I'm putting in the rejection Fence location.  34.12 but now I'm on a different curve 35 here. We're on the red curve now. It's the same spread out anise.  Is the blue curve is?  This is an assumption. We're also going to make that your spread of happiness is like America.  Otherwise it gets even more complicated and we're just trying to do reasonable things right now. Okay. So here you go. This is 67.8.  So that means if I were to go draw a sample of size 40 and ask you how happy you are and I averaged together and I get a number and I run a hypothesis test.  68% of the time we're going to end up believing in the alternative.  That's cuz you guys are at 35 Universe screaming at me and I'm thinking you're 31, so I'm not going to believe 31 for very long, but unfortunately 32% of the time.  Weird random variation in y'all. I just happen to talk to all the low text. He's the low text or people write that sample. Sorry. I was just keep believing in at 31, which is not the real number.  Yes until the next light or so and you'll see if it's actually true and if you know, what's actually true why you even doing a study in the first place?  So you have a great point and we'll see how to resolve this in a moment.  How you feeling so far? Go ahead.  Suicide is coming up. Great question. It's even Messier.  T I'll take you through some messy things and then we'll call it quits and be like enough enough mess.  Other things you're worried about.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so here's what happens like what state is it the True Value in queso if you believe something way over there, it makes the distributions really far apart.  Okay, and if this is what you believe your rejection fences like over here.  Yeah, so it's easy to discover effects from their huge cuz it separates the sampling distributions and mix the power of huge number cuz you start sitting area under this one. You almost get one there Jackson fence is summer in the middle. So that's why it's good to have already been studied over the last 200 years.  It's left a small effects for y'all.  two-sided alternatives  Hidden Truths  both of you asked about those things right and other parameters of Interest. So here we are Prescott Pharmaceuticals. You're going to decide if some new drug Works 200 subjects treatment group gets the drug control group gets a sugar pill.  The drug has something to do with weight change.  So here we go.  Now you notice it feels different. Right suddenly. There's two populations.  Why does there have to be two populations?  now these are independent the placebo people aren't tied over in some way to the  the treatment group  so imma need two different variables new 70 average weight change.  Among all the people ever they could take the drugs or T4 treatment. They so maybe I was in the treatment group. I went in they weighed me before I took the bill. We wait an hour. It does something they weigh me after I'm a difference. So maybe I gained 2 pounds lost 4 pounds you gain 601 we averaged those numbers is weird because it's already a difference idea.  It is also the placebo people walk in while giving the sugar pill waiting our way home again take the difference. Maybe I'm the zero maybe you're 14 negative for whatever average those together for everyone ever. And that's what these numbers are. Now when we care about is the difference.  And these averages that are already averages of differences. Oh my goodness, so it'd be super boring if those were the same.  The average change in the treatment group is the same as the average in the placebo group.  And here I have a two-sided alternative, I rode here. It's unclear from the problem. If the drug is meant to increase weight or decrease weight.  Did you assume the pill with air to decrease weight?  Maybe didn't assume anything. I don't know but not all things are about all the all the people that love going to the gym and getting huge, you know, plenty of things about weight increasing supplements.  So they're out there.  Now it was hard here is I didn't tell you what the true difference is between the placebo changing effect and the treatment.  So what do we do when you don't know what the true thing is? What usually you decide the smallest value? That would be interesting to you.  You care about a drug that increases weight by .0001 pounds on average. Are you excited?  What year did new pill that could take it and instantly, you know, you're one pound heavier you decided yet.  So there's some number where you like? Well, I'm excited. Now I give you a pill it instantly increases your weigh 200 lb  Play this could be useful I would like to compete in a Sumo match this afternoon.  So you see there's like cases. So the song threshold where every human being has where they're like, it's starting to get interesting and I would actually care if this were there that's the smallest effective interest. It will vary from person to person. I'm going to say 2 lb dream something up and this is very very specific to the setting.  I can't give you any rule that applies in all of these depends.  Okay.  So that then becomes what you put in your picture.  Now you got to draw off first. What you think is going on. I think the differences are going to be 0  Okay, so there's a blue curve and here's the red one. The least interesting thing for me would be to  this is weird because you have to draw the curved somewhere on the page. Are you excited about it being two more positive to or you excited about -2?  I don't know what you're excited about choose one of the two sides and just throw it down. It turns out not to matter. If you draw out on the other side the whole picture just gets flipped and all the calculations remain the same. So in truth, whatever this difference really is, it's something I just don't know which side it's on and I don't even know if it's that number, but that's what we're going to operate under the assumption that the least interesting thing.  Okay, so there you go. You draw it down.  Now I'm going to use a wheat change standard deviation of 12 lb, if you put people through some complicated weight thing on average you can make them gain or lose 12 lbs. Sorry, it's spread out notice of what you see in their weight changes. So there's some number you just have to go look that up and we've got 20 participants. So what you think about now is what kind of sampling distributions are they? Oh my goodness there about differences of two proportions.  Have you filled out that thing on page one of the homework yet?  The rightmost column two proportions facts facts facts facts facts. Well, those are going to get used right now. For example house right out is a blue curve. It's about subtracting two different ideas. It's spread out this standard deviation going on in the treatment group the same thing going on in the control group / their sizes.  Just inquiring just Madden doing all this okay on this problem. We're just going to assume that like the treatment group and the control group will be equally spread out.  Because we have nothing else to go on if we don't assume that you see there's all sorts of assumption for making all over the place, right?  The trouble is like this is all you can really do.  Okay, there's so many facts. You don't actually know and you just trying to get a good rough guess of how many how much power your study will have so don't get worked up over. Like I'll be should really be T distribution is not normal and don't get real worked up over there be a little less spread maybe in the control group and in the treatment Group Change like okay, you just have to stop all of this because if you want to get super nitpicky, you have no way to even proceed cuz you won't know any of these numbers.  So it's getting rough estimate anyway, so there.  Oh my goodness.  So where you going to see as we learn more and more stuff is that I can give you problems about power in those new settings. So we started with just one population and a meme now. Suddenly, we have two populations with two means eventually we'll have a proportion in one population. Then we'll have two populations with proportions Etc.  Okay, so here's our picture. Now. This was a two-sided alternative so normally  We would be excited about seeing things on the low end or the high end and no matter where they showed up. We could cause rejection on either side. So we're actually going to have to rejection fences here.  So if use .05, you can imagine that area being split into a .025 on the left and a .025 on the right.  And that would help you define what those rejection fences were.  So I'm going to go do a calculation in our right now. It's going to be a few Norm calculation cuz I want to find a place along the horizontal axis.  Okay, you can see me doing it and hears me coming up with what we want. So let's look at this. First of all, there's to rejection fences because high or low results are exciting and move you to the alternative which is excited about high or low results positive or negative here. Okay. Now, what did I do here .97 5 so you can see me plowing through this .025 here.  Then filing through 95 just to get to this location of that fence.  The other calculations you could have done that may have felt more intuitive. You could have just plowed through .025 and got into this fence.  Or you could have plowed through and said lower is false and just doing up or shading of .02 five. It'll give you a 3.32 so it's not the way to get these.  Okay, so there are two fences.  And now we need to shave the area.  for the power  It's the area under the red curve.  in the rejection region  Plural, let me say that for you. Here it is.  You can see the area over here right plenty of that and I shaded it there but  it's so tiny.  There's basically negligible. You can't even see it, but I tried to shade it.  Okay, the reason is so silly is like if the difference in these things really a positive to okay if he very weird to do a study and get a difference way over here like -5  Try hard for a universe that wants to give you to give you negative five so you can include this in the power calculation, but it's going to be basically worthless hears me finding both of those areas. I'm taking the rejection consultation and going to the right on the red curve.  And I'm taking the other rejection Fence location at -3.32.  And I'm shooting to the left on the red curve. Look how much beautiful area that second one contributes. So it'll turn out if you have a two-sided alternative you always recording to rejection when you go to shade the power one of the areas will be really important and valuable and the other will be worthless and you can ignore the other one if you wish.  I mean flock .00 8 cannon.  Let's not get all worked up in life. Do you want to put them both, but I don't really care.  So when you add those together that gives you the power.  So basically the power here is about 22% So what it means is  if the difference if this drug really can make you gain or lose 2 pounds.  When you go to your study with your hundreds and hundreds of people.  You're only going to believe that it does something 22% of the time 78% of the time you're going to walk away and be like I just doesn't do anything. Throw it in the garbage.  So we do not have enough people in her study to discover this and you were super excited about the effect of 2 lb.  But you just not going to find it.  The most people I know don't actually think about any of this.  If you look at what actually happens in the real world, most people do not design their study in such a way that it has high powered.  And if you go look actually they've done plenty of studies going to the research literature take a study and actually calculated power.  Do this for lots of studies averaging together you get about 50% That's the average power of a study. It was actually done by human beings in the world.  That's like I have the cure for cancer. Let's flip a coin and see if you're going to believe it at the end. It seems crazy, right?  No zero, do the worst Power you could have 50/50 mix equally likely that you're going to discover it or not. Okay, but let's say you actually the cure for cancer and I'll give you a 20-sided die. And if you roll the number one your study actually revealed to have the cure for cancer in any other number you walk away being like that just doesn't work with stupid drug. I made that's even worse right and you got like a 5% chance.  This is the reality of actual studies. So this is why we're teaching power calculations more in society. So the people start to think like, oh, well, the reason you do a study in the first place is because secretly in your soul you believe you've discovered something, right?  So would it be nice if you would like actually conducted the test and had a really good chance of discovering what you believe in your soul.  Yes, this is all designing you. Dude. You can do this and you should do this before you even collect data.  I actually we will we're going to turn it on its head in a second here and we're going to think about it the other way like what power do you want? Okay to some number and then we're going to figure out what sample size will ensure that power which is how it's actually used.  Yeah, so this is all pre-planning and that's the reason it would like making all these crazy assumptions that I keep like I don't got to use that stupid normal curve. It's cuz we're just like saying like all this is the least interesting thing I could get excited about. So let's try some stuff. We're running out of time. Maybe we should stop.  Okay, let's not go to Socrative. We have to get through this topic. Otherwise, I'm going gets destroyed going backwards.  deciding on a sample size  Sorry, it was really good questions to be on the web for the final exam.  How do you decide how many people are going to be in your study? This really is the most interesting question about study design.  Okay, so you're all the things you need to know if you're going to decide how big your sample size is going to be first. You got to decide in some Alpha. Usually your field that you're in has decided this for you.  Okay, but you can change this if you want you got to decide how powerful you would like the test to be is it a good test that discovers effects when they're there or is it like rolling a 20-sided die?  Smallest change that would be interesting to you. This will depend and finally what kind of tests are you running are there was a one population or the two, is it about means is it about proportions? So here's our setup.  You create a new MCAT review course and you'd love to know if it actually raises scores.  Here's the current MCAT scoring range.  Very obtuse, right?  472-2528 with an average of 500  Hey, so that's how people do on average right now. Anyone taking the MCAT here yet?  This is right that good. You're never ready. The first time you don't realize how serious it is and how much you actually have to know. I didn't want to be a doctor though once you go out. So what's going on all these Medical School interviews and you see all these people sitting there with you and they're actually really really excited about medical school and I was just excited about learning and knowledge and stuff science.  But that's how I knew and then I was like I should be a math teacher at that's what I really love. You want to be 95% sure in your hypothesis test conclusion. Okay, that's me saying something.  about Alpha here  Okay, it's the type 1 error rate you desire set up at 90% power.  Now you don't know it.  But the course actually raise his grades five points on average. Hey, good job.  How many students must you put through the course to meet the demands of this setup? So let's start going here first to find a variable. So what you're trying to measure.  Parameter about some population the average score of all people ever that could take your course past present future is infinitely many I suppose.  Next thing. I mean, we haven't actually put anyone through the course yet, so doesn't matter.  If you super boring if the course did nothing.  So putting them, so course won't change what's going on on average already at the MCAT and I would be super excited about a one-sided alternative cuz I don't care if it lowers.  30 really bad  Okay, then draw some curves. One of these is what you believe in your soul is happening and the other is what's actually happening when you collect data from the universe you believe the blue Center to 500 but the universe.  is 505  now here's where it gets weird.  Before we used to like find rejection fences and stuff right in order to find those you have to know how spread out those curves are. That's the standard deviation of the standard error here.  The formula for standard error depends on N square root of n is in the denominator for it, right?  Oh my gosh.  so how do I even like start putting things down when I don't know what's going on with the spread out is  so the trick here is not to figure out the exact location immediately.  But you figure out the location in numbers of standard errors how many standard errors above 500 will the rejection fence be you can answer that even if you can't pinpoint the exact location because you don't know what the standard error value is. So here's how you do it. You answer the question on the normal distribution if I plow through the normal distribution 95% of the area to leave .05 over on the right side for my rejection fence. The standard normal says you need to go all the way out to 1.645.  So in my picture, which is not a standard normal.  It means I could draw the rejection fence at 1.64 standard errors.  The question answered on the standard normal has wiped away the spread. So if you go back and do the question on your picture just reintroduced the spread.  So there's where the rejection fence is. Okay. I still haven't exactly been pointed it but I drew it and I have some knowledge and the next thing you want the power to be the Shaded area and you wanted to be .9. So how many standard errors below 5.5 * 505 which is where the Red Carpet Center. Do you have to go? Well don't answer it on the red curve just go to a standard normal and say like okay if I want a standard normal and I wanted this big hunk and area on the right side to be 90% What would I go calculates? How would I look that up? Okay, so there's 10% left in the left tail over here.  And you can see -1.28. It's how far you have to go that way.  So did the area here is 0.9 is your desire they said there's a few Norm calculation. It's happening on the standard normal because that's the easiest way to do that place to do this. Okay. So now you can draw another little segments here if I started at 505 and I went to the left 1.28 standard errors. I would get to the rejection fence see both of these calculations were just trying to get to the rejection fence you starting at 500 and working away out to it. That was the first calculation and then we starting at 5:05 and working your way the other way.  It's because all the numbers that you're giving him the problem have to do they center around where the rejection fence is.  Okay, so now we can actually finish the problem because you'll notice something.  when you add together one point  2/8 standard errors here and you had these 1.64 of them. It's supposed to spend this distance of 5 so you can write an equation based on this.  Here's what it looks like.  2.92 standard errors has to be V. I just added 1.64 apples + 1.28 apples.  And that's how I got 2 .92 apples and now you can go substitute in what the standard error formula is.  I noticed it has a sigma in it.  Hi, what's that?  and as the end which is what we're trying to find right now, so you have to go look up on the Internet how spread out MCAT scores are  The job with your experience of MCAT scores and people crying and screaming during the exam.  So when I took it, the first section was the verbal at like 8 a.m. And after the verbal section people got in the hallway in their lives are over. They failed the verbal section blah blah blah. Did I happen to you?  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah, it's pretty like unnerving. If you're not one of the crying people like the emotion around it. Okay. So anyway, and it's sitting there waiting for you to solve for it.  Now when you exactly fell for it, you can get some horrible decimal. Obviously. You can't have a decimal number of human beings. So we are always going to round up.  If you round down and you slightly fewer than your supposed to have.  Then all the things you want will be slightly below the threshold your desire. Your power won't be 90% of the be like 89.6 cuz you really needed 30.78 human beings and you only pulled in 30 so round up and you will always get  What you want in life?  now in truth  You can see this is super complicated right lots of steps visualisations not actually with human beings to do in the world figure out sample sizes. I don't do this calculation when I want a sample size.  I have a little midget do it for me. So I'll show you this widget. Is it a stockbroker LG power?  It's fine powers and Sample sizes like we've been doing. Okay. So all I have to do is type some stuff into it. You can see it draws two little pretty pictures, right? Okay, it's doing exactly what we just did so I don't know. What do you do here you feel like typing some something called the effect size.  What you don't know what that is. You have to type in what your significance level Alpha?  type in the power you want  Okay, hit the calculate button boom boom boom and it spits things out and here's the answer 31.  Once you learn about effect size, is that the only thing you're missing?  There is sort of a complicated area. But anyway g-power you can go download it for free on the internet if you want.  You can use it to sort of roughly check answers on the homework if you want to see if you're in the vague vicinity, but you have to like choose a lot of things correctly in this menu hear some of which we haven't really talked about. But anyhow, there's another problem here at the end if you want to practice some more cuz these are tough.  But good luck and have a nice weekend. "
