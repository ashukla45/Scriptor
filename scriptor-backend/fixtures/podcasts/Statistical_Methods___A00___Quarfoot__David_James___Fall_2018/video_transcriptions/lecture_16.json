The central limit theorem most important result in probably all of Statistics at this level. So just to recap what we did. We took some population and millions of people in it that was too complicated to study. So we started a small sample of some size and I just fix it end Styx from now on.  When you cut your sample, maybe you find the mean in it. Maybe that's the statistic you care about now. If you imagine repeating this process infinitely many times. We got this thing down here. This green thing called the sampling distribution, and it's actually nothing more than the distribution of xbar which itself is a random variable that changes from sample to sample it varies and some weird random way.  Okay, so there's that now all this time I've been saying but that green distribution is normal.  And it turns out that it basically always is and here's a cool thing. It's normal in the green Universe regardless of whatever is going up on up here in the population. That is one of the most important facts because all the analysis happens down here in the green curve.  And if his green curve is only normal when the thing up in the population is normal. Well, that's pretty limited. But more importantly you never get to know what's going on on the population. So we need some sort of infrastructure that works regardless of what kind of disaster is going on in the population.  And the central limit theorem says basically the same thing distribution of xbar will basically always be normal regardless of what you start with.  Now it becomes more and more normal and is a better approximation for what's going on. The bigger your sample size is and what you're about to see in a second if we don't always get normality.  We do as long as the sample size that you're taking.  Is big enough?  In order to deal with what's going on hidden from you up in the population. So I'll show you some pictures here and it is a pretty convincing. So here's what they did. They took a population population that uniform on some interval the IQs of some aliens on some IQ scale and they're just likely to get any scores any other basically, okay, and you could say I'm going to go take my two favorite aliens. I'm going to ask them their IQ and I'm going to average it you could have value for x bar. You can imagine repeating that many many many times you get lots of X bars and when you make a histogram iPhone, okay, you get this blue curve.  Now the red Dash thing is what a perfect normal distribution would look like they look pretty similar. Don't they? Okay, it doesn't matter where these two people are five people or a large number of people.  Now what happens if you start with a population with a very skewed they all these aliens want to have very low IQs. It's very hard to get high IQ aliens on this planet for some reason. So now when you take your two favorite ones averaging together get the mean and repeat that many many times you get the blue curve doesn't look super normal does it?  But if you were to take more aliens like five average amount of gather get in X bar.  Repeat that process many many times with different groups of 5 and take all those X bars and put them in a histogram. Now, the blue curve is a little closer to being normal cuz you can see in red what a normal curve look like.  And by the time you're asking 12 or even 30 people suddenly the same thing distribution is starting to look really normal.  If you take this log normal, this is one of the most skewed distributions there is  Okay, it's fights against you for a very long time. It doesn't want the sampling distribution to be normal. But by the time you get to about 30, even it or lense.  Something that you never know what's going on up in the cloud. You can never actually see your population and take of the uniform they could be normal. It could be some exponential or log normal some crazy thing but all of them relent and give way to normality in the sampling distribution, as long as you start asking enough people.  That's pretty slick. I would say.  Okay, so as the sample size grows the sampling distributions going to look more normal. That's just you looking in one column and noting it the blue and the red or converging to each other.  But also what's important here is it's okay. If the population is weird that you're trying to study as long as you counteract its weirdness with an appropriate sample size so that you can wash away its tendency to be strange.  Okay, so people say things like no SKU small SKU moderates view as long as you're asking about 30 people in your sample, you're fine. The sampling distribution will be roughly normal and all the things you want to do with that like build confidence intervals and hypothesis test. You'll be fine. If you got some queasy thing you're studying and you happen to know in advance if it's going to be crazy like income inequality in the US.  Then you might need large or samples.  So that you dig your way deeper into this column and so do you actually get a blue curved it's normal, which is what you want in order to do all this inference.  So whatever you do inference that is your building confidence intervals or running hypothesis test. Those are the two kinds of inferential statistics that go on.  You should always check some conditions and these conditions are designed so that it makes the sampling distribution pretty pretty normal.  May 1st the day that you fill your sample with they better be independent of one another  Now sometimes you doing something like flipping a coin and that's generating the data rolling a die. Those are always independent cuz the guy doesn't remember what happened last roll.  Sometimes you're going out and asking human beings and it's very unclear to me if your weight is independent of your weight. Maybe you're both on the lacrosse team and all you do is exercise all day. And this has some effect on your weight it so It's Tricky with human beings cuz you can't see all the connections between them that are subtle.  So instead of checking for Independence, there are two conditions that sort of imitated one's called randomization. If I choose people that fill up my sandals sample randomly. It's very unlikely you'll both be in there. It's okay if you are.  But Randomness will take away those sorts of things. The other thing is the 10% condition. You don't want your sample to.  Be too big.  Because then what happened is you start filling it up at the end.  You start to know what's about to happen. So we had this exact thing. I think earlier we're talking about it.  I Take 5 people in the room and I give him the special token, right?  Enamored are sample. I'm just start asking people if they have the token. Well if I plan on asking basically everyone in the room, that's how big my sample is after a little while. I will have found all those five tokens. So when I keep asking people already know what their answer is before they say anything.  What is less than 10% sort of keeps you from digging too deep into your universe?  And then the rest are just whatever is left over from the first 97% of it that you talk to or something like that.  There's a certain condition population distribution must be nearly normal.  So this is about the blue thing.  Now I said just a second ago doesn't matter what shape it is, right?  So it's okay if it's not nearly normal as long as if it's skewed you have a pretty big sample size. So another way of thinking about this bottom condition, which I know right? If you want a nice Harmony between the skew of the population which you probably can't see and the sample size.  As long as those are harmonized appropriately it will make the sampling distribution normal, which is what we're trying to get.  So perfect world. Your population is normal, then it doesn't really matter next best thing. It's starting to get skewed. Okay. Maybe you have a sample size of about thirty. Now. You're going to meet this condition. Okay, next best thing. It's horribly skewed. Sorry. You're studying something weird. You're still okay, as long as drawing huge samples 6800. There's no perfect number here. So Harmony between the school and the population and the sample size.  What's dry conditions in practice? How will you do Susie Q is going to create a 95% confidence interval for the average salary of all us CEOs.  That's a lot of CEOs.  Make a million.  I don't know. I can never talk to that many. She randomly chooses 8 and finds the mean of those particular eight salaries. She build her confidence interval and feels satisfied.  What is wrong with her approach?  What's pink for 20 seconds?  That's only 15 seconds.  20 seconds  No, say they were all they knew you were going to answer until then. They didn't think so. We can calling you.  Are you independent?  Are you guys independent or do you share a mind hive mind? Okay, go ahead what's wrong with this?  So stop you said the possible average salary is skewed.  That's not what I want.  population  possible that the distribution of the population which is two CEOs and you're measuring their salaries that could be really really skewed. Okay. So what?  Good see you in a larger sample to counteract. Okay, when you build a confidence interval you been drawing this pretty little normal distributions and finding the Z stars and all this nonsense. Right? Well, it requires that the sampling distribution to be normal. Well, the only way to get that normal is either start with something beautiful.  And do whatever you want in life or if it's horribly disastrous counteract its disastrous be with a large enough sample. So I'm guessing that CEO salaries are not gentle enough and it turns out they're not so we need to check the two conditions.  Now she did meet the independence condition because she chose random CEOs. I don't know how she did that but whatever that's a different problem and she didn't choose too many of them.  Okay, there's more than 80 CEOs, which is 10 times the number she chose that means the 10% condition but these n equals eight is probably problematic in relation to the skew here's the picture of CEO salaries on the x-axis is salaries in hundreds of thousands of dollars. So most of them are making about 300,000 but you got all these people way up here.  Making millions and then there's people making even more the Google's of the world. Oh my goodness. She knew how much so much money is crazy.  So this is pretty skewed now, that's not the population. That's so you know a hundred or so to 70 or I don't know what's in there but it gives a good sense of what the population looks like. So usually the only way you can tell how skewed the population is  which you can never see its to look at the sample.  And if a sample with biltwell, it should be representative of the population. So it's weird. We want no malady of the sampling distribution that's determined by what's going on with the population, but you can't see what you look at. I'm looking at the sample that you have in front of you.  That's how this ends up working super complicated.  Socrative in see how you do today and if we can break the internet  Oh, we can't make the internet today.  The weight of quarters in the u.s. Is normally distributed not all quarters weigh the same here. I'm using weight and mass dirtily interchangeably even though they're not  but that's okay.  Standard deviation of quarters .07 set up a random variable.  What does it represent?  Why you getting so Fancy? No need to get fancy. The weight of quarters normally distributed mean 5.7.  Standing Ovation .07 wrote that sentence in symbols  Okay for something to be a sampling distribution first, you have to talk about taking a sample that's done know we're here then which of the sample of to do something with it calculator statistic X bar maximum. Median, whatever you want. We didn't do any of that here.  Then you have to imagine repeating the process infinitely many times and exploring all the different Xbox you could ever get we didn't do that here. That's why there's not a sampling distribution.  That was the population.  What does the probability X is less than 5.67 equal?  Select all that are correct.  Are you gaming the system yet?  There's a gaming system. Try to select every single one. You can it will stop you at some point when it  Maybe never tried to select more than the correct number of answers Socratic shut you down. So then you how many answers there are.  Then you should read things. How do we do?  Oh.  Some were chosen more than others.  Probability that a random quarter weighs less than 5.67. That's what this means. The sex is the rate the weight of a random quarter and its probability is calculating that likely to happening probabilities and percentages are the same idea.  Best distribution happens to be centered at 5.67 and be normal so half the areas below and half as above because of symmetry.  Now people are never going to stop selecting D. No matter how much I try.  The particular quarter in my pocket that is not a random event.  It's here, right?  But either does or doesn't weigh less than 5.67. It has no probability associated with it or if you want to associate one inside their zero or 100% it either does or doesn't  only random things that probability you pick five random quarters  you haven't to the weights.  Which random variable y represents what you have done.  What happened?  Drv3, that's great. That's called learning.  If they're easier to take them away also, so it's never going to feel good.  Okay, there we go. Now look at all you people choosing D. You were trying to get super fancy you realized there was some sort of.  Been going on.  Sobe obviously we'll do the right answer. It's so simple and maybe you didn't want to choose it.  Now sometimes you can actually find the distribution for why.  Which is smaller.  Pxs in fiber p y less than 5.  How conceptual things?  So you saw the complicated explanation, right?  The first one is asking. What's the probability of rain in quarters less than 5 grams.  The other one saying can you get an average of 5 quarters?  To be less than 5.  so if the original picture looks like this 5.67 tears 5 and you want to get it less than  Five that's doable. Right and I saw someone just doing something with their hands.  You did this talk to me about that.  Curtis kind of crunching in  Yats of any Mark V right here and there's a lot left area. How'd you know the variance of this was smaller? What is the variance of this?  They took the squirt. You took the variance over here.  You understand a deviation that easier?  So this is Sigma over the square root of an right. We're sigma's how spread out the left universe is. Sorry people at home. You can see the pictures.  Okay. So when you averaged together five people, it camps down the variability in what's happening cuz in your sample you already have heavier and lighter people averaging each other out or coins or whatever is going on. So if you used to do that soon as you have five people hold my arm it does that.  So there's the metaphor that was tricky which of these histograms would have the smallest spread.  populations and samples and sampling distributions Galore  There's two thirds of the room.  Okay, the weight of a hundred random quarters, that's a sample when you graph a sample. It looks like the population.  At the point of a sample to look like its population has fewer members in it, but still looks like it. Okay 10000 quarters. That's a sample looks like its population.  The average of sets of 10. That's like what I just do on the board you're starting to do something with your samples and it hands down the variability that can happen. Obviously 100 will be better than 10 in tamping down variability average together a hundred people use to get the truth of what's going on, basically.  Okay, that was pretty hard it all this conceptual stuff is tricky.  Are you tired of averages yet?  You know, there's a whole world out there of other things you can do in life besides find the average of something. It's time for us to face other parameters besides Mew.  Okay, so here's we've been doing so far. We've been using meditation music and X bar.  And what was cool about this is once we got X bar, we should have lifted it back up to help us figure out things about Mew.  And we had this little formula.  I need to know what you got for X bar. I need to know how spread out X bars could be in life. And I want to know what confidence level you would like cuz I could send coded and disease star guy. So that was the procedure. Now, we're going to go change these things and you'll notice that all you have to do is Alter what's going on is Formula so X bar. Well, if you want to change to some other idea like proportion that will be now a proportion there and here we would just need to know how spread out the world of proportions could possibly be but the infrastructure will remain the same.  Okay, so maybe you want to study what percentage of Americans identify as LGBT there's population and there is some parameter.  Okay. I'm a nice letter P for the rest of time or population proportions.  Right now I have to choose some letter down in the sample.  I guess I'll put P hat is the way you say this. That's what everyone in the world uses. So if xbar and P hat  As things going on in samples.  So there's lots of parameters out there and you might study you can also do correlation. If you have two variables going on your measuring how related are Twitter follower counts and Facebook friends do people have lots of Twitter followers and have lots of Facebook friends and vice versa small small.  You probably believe that might be true, but you can measure through this statistic known as correlation that we have to study standard deviation.  How spread out is this universe that you are studying?  It's not as common question, but it's pretty natural spread in the number of selfies that celebrities post on Instagram.  Today all post tons and tons or some celebrities like I'll give you one every five days and other people are like I'll give you 17 per day. Those would be much different spread out in this is of this experience. So you can try to measure a sigma we don't do in this class because it's a little harder but in 181 a for example, you will do that kind of thing.  So let's think about changing the infrastructure over.  Infrastructure for confidence interval for now and will always look like the following this is what actually in my head.  You take a point estimate. That's what you got in your sample for whatever it is. You want to study that your best guess of what's going on and then you want to pad it. Well, you have to know how spread out is weird statistic is that you're excited about being an average or proportion or something similar.  You also have to know something about this is you star here. That's a star is a number that's coming from a normal distribution.  That's why I hit the letter z.  So if the sampling distribution of whatever it is, you're trying to study happens to be normal, then you can use this formula but not all sampling distributions are normal.  No matter what sample size you draw. There's some crazy ones out there.  Okay, so what would I do for the rest of the class is basically  think about what the sampling distribution is four different statistics.  And use these formulas right here.  We also have to figure out how to spread out the sampling distributions are and where they're centered.  And when you see the infrastructure happen the fifth or sixth or seventh time will be a moment or like this is so easy. They're all the same nice pattern to life. You've built in infrastructure pesos. Let me show you what a problem looks like. It's a different infrastructure.  You do a sample for UCSD students. You want to know what percent use that beautiful app Snapchat?  22 say they do.  Would you admit to using it if some researcher came up?  Maybe I don't know. Okay, what you have to do in order to make any progress in these problems. Well, here's me telling you. How spread out.  the possible sample proportions are  for the world of normal distributions and means this formula right here with Sigma / \u221a end. It's right here on the board.  That's something you just heard of getting your soul and will be tattooed there forever. But if you care about proportions, it looks different. So I'm curious if you can go build a 95% confidence interval.  For the true parameter that's being studied in this this will feel very uncomfortable. You're in a totally new world renown with nothing except the infrastructure of what you been doing before carries over. So give us a go see how you do Brave New World. You just landed on a planet.  You're walking around.  So I think I can choose.  whoa  How do I get that?  free  he's got a TI-84 on his cell phone.  wabbit emu  Okay.  I don't know that's super cool on it free.  Yeah.  Okay, so what's going on in this problem?  First of all, what are you trying to measure the proportion of all UCSD students?  Do you Snapchat? That's a parameter The Faculty? What did you do? If you got a sample and 22 of the 40 did that's P hat now. You have to realize there's variation in P hat ja new sample. You're going to get a slightly different result, right?  So that's what this SE is trying to tell you trying to see how spread out those peahats could be.  Now first figure out your best guess I just divided that 55% if I have no other option, I have to say a number. I'm going to scream that number right now here. I plug that P hat into this formula and it looks like it's quite common to get results that are about 8% higher and 8% lower or maybe even a couple 8.  That's what could have happened.  So according to the formula now, we're going to have to go figure out how to make a 95% confidence interval. Maybe you have memorized would see stars for that. If you don't you can go dry yourself a picture do it on the standard normal but 95% of the area there and then go figure out these bounds using some Q Norm or whatever some table whatever you want. So hopefully you just plugged everything into the normal confidence interval formula started your best guess and Pat it.  So between 40% and 70% of you use Snapchat if we trust the 22 people in our sample.  Another way you can say it. We're 95% confident in this thing. We're putting forward. This interval putting forward is from a family of possible confidence intervals 95% of those service will capture the true thing p  I don't know if mine does.  I sure hope it does but I'll never know because we'll never know piano us. We talk to every single one ever.  So you should get used to notation here parameters are going to use certain letters and their equivalent versions down in the sample known as statistics will use their particular letters. This will always remind you where you are.  It's always the population parameters that were excited about studying.  Time for the weekend, right?  Here's an interesting question.  This is important in society to notice do men and women have the same weight. So first equalize weight.  Okay have different blood alcohol content. BAC is  when they drink exactly the same number of beers.  That is do men and women have different body processes about flushing out or retaining alcohol. This is super important to know for all sorts of reasons that you can dream up one of which being  you're the DMV and you're trying to decide how many drinks people can have before they're too drunk or something and you can make some table for people look at its useful.  Now, how do you how do you figure a question like this out? Well, here's our plan. We're going to pick 10 UCSD Men Who weigh 180. Sorry, if you don't weigh 180, you can't be part of her study and we'll give them for beers.  You'll decide how fast you're going to require them to drink them. There's all sorts of variables here that you have to sort of control, right?  So then you calculate their BAC if you'll do it like 10 minutes after they've drunk them or an hour, whatever. You said sometime, right?  Okay. So in those 10 you get this average BAC .13 is above 2.084 legal driving probably can get in the car. Now. You do the same thing for 10 women who weigh 180 and you get .15 now. This is our first time ever where we have two legitimate populations men and women and we don't know anything about either.  Before if I painted the picture of two populations like Game of Thrones and bachelorette tweets. I completely summarized one of universes and told you what me was so effectively banished but here I no idea what's going on with either Mysteries.  Oh my goodness. Well, how do you exist in this kind of world? So first let's figure out what we're actually trying to study.  Now we have two different universes and they each have an average.  News of app is the average BAC for any UCSD female who weighs 180 that you give for beers to.  There are many many people in that population. I can never talk to them all there's 37,000 students are okay. Now, they don't always want 180 but the same idea over with all the men who weigh 180 if you drink 4 beers, I don't know either these so they're both unknown. So one thing to do is just say, oh they're both unknown. I've two different Unown the others to subtract them and a great one cookie. That's unknown.  It's a little easier to deal with right.  And this is what we're going to do later in the class. They said that's the difference in the BAC for 180 lb people who drink 4 beers and go to UCSD.  Okay, I chose females might as males. If you do the other order everything is just the negative version which is totally fine.  Now we need our sample statistic this way if we know cuz we calculated two different samples one from each population. We got our values.  I even put bars over them. That should feel statistic e  and I use Dex. Okay, so here in our samples when we started bring them together. We see that the women are .02 BAC higher than the men.  So it appears that women get a little drunker from 4 beers than men do when you equalize the weights.  But that number has variability right draw different samples averaging subtract. You get a new number draw different sample average.  Subtract you would get another number. So in order for us to figure out anything, I'm going to have to tell you the variability of what's going on in these subtraction of averages. I need to tell you how this expression right here x f bar- XM bar varies. So here I'm just going to tell you a number that equals.  So it's hard to figure this out. We're going to do it later. Another thing that you have to know is what distribution.  Attract subtract when you look at all these subtraction these differences. What do they look like? Well going to turn out that's going to be normal amazingly.  Isn't it so convenient when you get normal things? I love it.  Sampling distribution of the difference of two averages will turn out to be normal most of the time. I'll later teach you with the spread out in the Seas of all those sample differences, but she will use .01.  That's how much variability we would see it. Now. We got .02. So if it's .01, we would expect things like 1:03 or 4:01 or 0 for reasonable things or things in between. So here we can make our confidence interval with the same approach take your best estimate of how men and women differ that's going 0-2.  Add a certain amount of standard deviations based on how confident you want to be. I want to be 95% confident and then put her spread out all of these.  difference of averages are  Who is confusing right?  Two Worlds samples averages subtract make a number  repeat  that's what we're really studying here.  That was kind of interesting this interval. You notice these are our best guesses for what new F minus Mew M was  And this interval has only positive values in it.  So it sure seems like on average women will have a higher BAC than men.  And it turns out that's actually true when they weigh 180 and you get them for drinks.  It's different for every weight and all this other stuff. It gets really complicated.  If you wonder where I got my numbers from cuz obviously I didn't feed beer to people. I just pulled them from this little chart. You can get this at the DMV.  Pick your weight on the left side pick which gender you like on the left side.  And outside weights up here on the left stick. How many drinks you want to drink this weekend? And then this will tell you what your BAC is going to be. So there's no I got those numbers.  This will also tell you how many drinks you can roughly have and still get behind the wheel of a car. If you dare ever do such a thing. I want to point out this little thing down here fewer than five persons out of 100 will exceed these values. Hopefully when you see this now, it should feel like some sort of confidence level thing with 95% confidence some probabilistic statement.  That's what's actually happening here.  Oh good. I love this.  So let's think about this normality stuff a little more.  Is the green thing as you start studying different statistics always normal?  So the central limit theorem is specifically about X bar the average now you tend to do most things in life are about averages.  Probably next most important after that percentages.  So I would guess that 98% of the questions you've ever asked in life about samples. I probably been about averages or proportions related to them.  Sometimes I say things about like the maximum value or the minimum of the median of the spread out and it's okay. So we've seen that P hat.  In our little Snapchat example, I told you is normal and I told you that X1 bar - X2 bar. If you have two different worlds in your averaging and subtracting that turns out to be normal, but the standard deviation is never going to have a normal sampling distribution. There's an easy way to see why.  The spread out nest of something can only be positive.  So when you drop a sampling distribution of different possible spreads, you might get as you draw different samples. Those valleys will always be between 0 and infinity last time I checc normal distributions go both ways.  That's one way to know it'll turn out this something called a chi Square distribution after some fancy manipulation, but that's later in life where you don't really get a normal distribution one is very frustrating. That is if the statistic you're studying just doesn't have a normal sampling distribution guy. There's no way to ever fix that.  That's the second one down here. That's who sampling distribution really are not normal ever.  The other thing is if you have a set up it's about something that's supposed to be normal like X bar or P. Hat or X1 - X2 bars.  Glad your sample just isn't that great. Okay, so maybe of a population distribution that's really skewed.  And you only go talk to three people in this really weird skewed universe.  It going back all the way to the beginning of class. We all those pictures you saw. Sometimes it sampling distribution wasn't normal.  Okay, so it's not a perfect little Universe if you're talking about X bar, you're usually going to get no malady as long as there's a nice relationship between the population and the sample size. Now we can do hypothesis testing for other stats your Dexter again.  Dexter had surgery yesterday  he's doing well.  Hit his own Tramadol.  Everyone does well on tramadol.  I try hard to get the Vets to give you Tramadol cuz people like to consume Tramadol.  It's a pain med. You know how people are with those.  Anyhow just have to beg and eventually give you drugs.  So what's going to change as we start changing things?  What would change in each of the blow steps if the tests were about a different parameter? Okay, so I'm going to set this up like we've been doing it normally about averages.  Let me be the average stress level of UCF students that have dog therapy sound familiar.  We just did it right the other day. They said that was the old setup.  So what changes about this statement if we're going to do something with a different parameter? It's not about averages.  Go ahead.  Okay good.  So the first thing that changes is the thing you have to ask people to care about proportions. It's not on a 0 to 100 scale. It's like you do you feel stressed or not, which is a course or measure of what's going on. And you know that you mentioned proportions are going to start happening. So we're going to fuse a different letter here and the way we measure it will be different but fundamentally you were still set up.  Some sentences are the defined your parameter.  Okay, the next thing we did we stated some null and alternative hypotheses. What happens to bees when you use a different perimeter?  You can't save them anymore. They will save themselves.  Go ahead.  How do I have to change them?  Okay good. So you said first of all there better be proportion showing up here?  Second of all, these numbers are going to change. They need to be like What proportion of people are stressed? You don't go to Doctor P. And in addition the numbers that you see will be different. Okay, you can have a proportion equal to 81.  Cuz proportions are between 0 and 1. Okay, so what the structure will remain the same but the letters and some other things about to change what happened next when we're dealing with averages. Well, it turns out that the average at is X bar has a distribution that's called the sampling distribution. It shows you all the different Xbox you can ever get its supposed to be centered at Mew and have a certain spot out of signal over route end.  Okay, so then all the stuff pushes out with a particular number is no problem. So what changes if we use a different statistic?  You can't save them you've done it once.  Other voices glad take a chance.  What would this mute range to?  If I go back here to help you.  Yes, okay. So the mule is going to change to whatever the proportion is in the problem. So instead of you being 81 you have pee and whatever P was what else will change.  Okay. See you like everything else to say the same does anyone disagree?  Go ahead.  Okay, the standard errors this thing after the, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution you claim is different. How do you know that?  Call Allison 4000 it's a proportional to Sigma even make sense for proportion.  No, it doesn't Okay. So Something's Gotta change here. We don't even have that idea anymore.  What else might change?  Go ahead.  The kind of distribution is on that may not be in anymore. Now when we did the SnapChat thing I told you this was in that was close. We almost had a non-normal distribution for a second. I also told you what this was right here after the, that was the square root of p q / n or P. Hat you had over end if you remember that. Okay. So a lot of things might change the distribution where it's a nerd how spread out it is.  Okay, I guess it's time to stop.  I'll give you your 1 minute freedom.  Have a nice weekend. "
