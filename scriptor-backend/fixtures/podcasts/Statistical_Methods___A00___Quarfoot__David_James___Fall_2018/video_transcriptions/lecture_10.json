    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back to thoughts before we begin the first I would strongly recommend you go to discussion section tonight. They are going to be talking about some things in our that we haven't had time to talk about.  That will be very valuable when you were working the our problems at the end of homework 5 and those skills.  Will be used on almost every homework sat for the rest of time in this class.  Are these are the way that you Generate random numbers and are the ways that you do with probability distribution. So you now know geometric & poisson and so on so I was trying to do that. Are you texting as you may have looked at the exam solutions by now?  One thing you should think about is you look at those.  Is if you didn't get things right what really held you back was it probability and statistics kinds of ideas or which will be true for some people or was it things from other classes that you really supposed to know when you just don't really know. So for example in the last problem. I got the TA who finished reading the last problem. I said how many people could actually get through the probability stuff and get to an internet sensation when she said most people could  And she said that's where things fell apart. They just had no recollection at all about how to do anything with infinite series. Despite the hinge being right there telling you what to do with the infinite Series, so you should really look honestly about what's going on and why you miss things in life, you're starting to get really really high up and education. Right? And what you're going to find is you really need to know all the things from the past 16 years or so.  And if you don't really know those things it will hold you back moving forward and you don't want to be like that. So analyze why you're getting things wrong instead of getting emotional about it and then go fix us had a great turnout. I've no idea. They're only halfway graded. So  Tomorrow I guess we'll know it's time to have a continuous random variable. This is something you probably did not see if you took High School AP Stat or something like that because calculus is definitely a prerequisite for this and so AP Stat doesn't have a few rack.  So I think this is where things get most interesting actually if you look at what you were missing out on before and what you could have learned. So the book doesn't talk about this in a very good detail. We have this supplement online on trading at that. You can go pick on and read if you want sort of 10 or 15 pages talking about this sort of stuff. So here's where we are right now all you know about or discrete random variables using machines that you hit a button on and they spit out a number and that number comes from a finite list of possibilities like this game right here that we played the other day or possibly infinitely many things but they have space between the values. Maybe it's just a positive integers are the positive integers or 0 + 0 something like that. So what is continuous random variables they take on numbers as well, but she was through a smooth Continuum on interval like on the real number line.  So you can get decimals. Absolutely 2.7. You can get weird irrational numbers like the square root of 2 coming out of this you can get anything.  Having trouble with this is we're going to rethink everything we've done because our architecture and our framework doesn't carry over to this new setting very well.  Natural wonder where this might actually come up in like this and this example is here how much water you drink in a day that could be almost any number right? How long you wait for a bus how far you live from the nearest grocery store is infinitely many possibilities and there was smooth continuum.  So here come the awkward questions when you try to apply our existing framework to this new universe. How do you make a probability table for such a situation obviously has infinitely many rows. What what row do you put after x equals 1?  There is no number after one in the real number system. Don't say it like 1.0 Infinity zeros and then one at the end that's not even a well-defined idea what exactly some amount of water. Oh my goodness. And so far all our probabilities have been this ratio. And the number of outcomes in the sample space has been finite. So what are you doing? The denominator is infinity. Also the numerator could be Infinity 2  So we can have to build a whole new framework continuous random variables. We have to change how we present the probability model cuz I can't make a table for you. We're going to change the kinds of questions we ask because our old questions don't really make sense anymore.  Andros going to change with probability of 0 meetings are making the transition as you can see I said we're going to do something 16 x and the probability of success is 1/2 then maybe we're flipping the coin 16 times and you can actually draw a picture that represents all the different probabilities of the things that could occur and you nice things that can occur here on the x-axis. Those are just the integers between 0 and 16. What's the possibilities right?  Okay. Well when you look at this picture you say what really matters to us in this picture?  So here are the three things that you definitely want in this picture. First of all, the bars better not dipped below the axis that would mean a negative probability. Okay. So whatever I'm about to do as I transition to The Continuous Universe, we better never. Garoppolo. Okay. Another thing the more likely something is to occur the more area you see related to it. Okay, so it seems like eat  Getting ate successes. When you flip the coin 16 times at the most likely thing and it's cuz the bar is the highest but instead of thinking it's the highest it has the most area underneath the or within that bar is a safer way to thank the sum of all the areas must be one guy something has to happen, right?  So those are actually the Salient properties that I need to make sure I carry over as we go to a continuous universe.  So, how do I do this?  Well first I draw a better picture of what's going on with binomial instead of those big thick rectangles. Let's just put a. At the appropriate height.  Okay.  now  you can probably guess what we need to do. If we're going to transition from these 17 discrete values 0 through 16 going to transition and use any possible value. It's screaming at you.  Maybe we should just connect the dots or draw some smooth curve and that would be the sort of continuous version of something not binomial anymore. Cuz I don't know is definitely just be a thing, but we're going to try to Model A continuous random variable. We're probably going to need some sort of picture like this to help us.  Over in the binomial world. It's just a bunch of. Sexually.  Now the tricky thing is when you make the switch and you draw a nice smooth curve now, you can least got all the possible X values down here on the horizontal axis. You have this whole range and you know, what's going on, but now the trouble is that this axis is no longer probability like it is on the left hand side now, it's something called density.  the reason I can't call that probability is because if it were probability and you started adding up all the different heights all these Heights here at up to 1 if I start putting in more.  I'm getting lots of additional values and it already adds up to one when it's just the dots over the smooth curve. It definitely doesn't add up to one anymore. When you got up all the Heights. In fact, it adds up to Infinity. Okay, so somehow the idea on the axis has been shifted and we're going to figure out what density means and think about this in a sec.  Okay, so when you have continuous random variables area is still going to be linked.  To How likely something is but we need to develop a framework around that because our access system is changed here. So let's start the development of the universe. This is hard the first time you see it. It's very counterintuitive for a lot of people. The first thing is if you have this random variable called X, you need a function to help you think about it.  It's called f of action is known as the density function and I just drew an example of one of them.  Now we also had this a deal with the speed things. It was those formulas like when it was binomial your something like in choose x x. X x 1 - P Diddy + - x  Okay, that was a helper tool that help you realize the probabilities going on. Okay. Now we need a very complicated function that tells us something at every single possible value of x and the density function will have to have two properties. First of all of better never dipped below the x-axis and what's that that pertaining that idea?  That you need positive Heights or hide zero is also allowed.  The other thing that you need the integral from negative Infinity to Infinity as you look over all possible values of could take on the area underneath the curve better be one.  Okay, so that's just saying when you look underneath the density graph got to have area one before was the sum of all the rectangles at it up to 1 or if you wrote the rectangles that just died. Then it was the sum of all the lights across one. So it's the carryover that idea to Super complicated continuous universe.  Now it's not crazy when you first see it if you remember 20b.  And the end of 20 a U or adding up some rectangles. They were called Riemann sums and then someone said what if we did infinitely many rectangles and you put a limit in front, so now I have a limit of a summation and what did that turn into?  An integral so the interval is always be sort of continuous version of adding stuff up. Where's the sum is the discrete idea.  The interval is nothing more than a sum sign that's been sort of elongated.  That's where it came from.  Now that will retain two of our date ideas for third is probability somehow being linked to area. Do you make this definition?  if you have this density function  related to some random variable called axe Nexus Louisville machine and you hit this button on accident should give me values. Well now exit spitting out all sorts of crazy things almost any number possible to make this definition of probability. The machine will spit out something between A and B is nothing more than the area under the density curve this helper function.  between a and b  and what this effectively does is make that connection between probability somehow being linked to area.  Now it's not the areas of rectangles at the areas under curves.  Okay. So here you go. You can start asking questions when you seen this definition. So here's a natural question to ask what the probability someone drink between 2 and 3 oz of water on some random day.  The reason this is a natural question is because it goes straight to this definition here which wants you to specify an interval.  And then you just going to integrate whatever this function f is depends on that human being and their drink Enos.  You just go in a great. Okay, might say something. Like I want to know the probability. They drink more than five. Well, the other band is unspecified, but guess what? It's Infinity more than 5 is just anything bigger.  Now some of these possibilities for X the person may never drink that amount. Okay, so sometimes FFX could be zero.  Is another example where the shows up person drinks less than 1 oz well hear that you've given one bound that's b and a is implied is negative Infinity.  So this is a case where the density function would definitely be zero for certain values of negative amounts of water.  Okay, so this interval actually collapsed and just go from 0 to 1 which will see later.  it's a diesel two kinds of questions that you ask and you look very different than the kinds of questions for discrete models or just like isn't going to spit out to is it going to spit out something greater than to those are the kinds of questions that  that one thing one consequence of this definition is the following which is very important the probability the machine spits out a particular number you have in your head called a  is 0  and the reason is you can just go back to the definition. You need the random variable to be between a n a that's the integral from a to a and guess what there's no area under a single point.  There's a little line segment on that curve, right that has a length.  but it has no area if the width is 0  So this is so counterintuitive the first time you see this we've got this machine. We can hit a button. It'll spit out some beautiful number the chance that spits out pie.  Zero chance that spits out 2-0 the chance of anything you're thinking zero and yet somehow it's still spit something out.  now this is only counterintuitive if you think about the probability being with zero this meaning something can't happen and we're going to rewire that in your brain to  The other important observation is this this function f of x is not telling you probabilities. It's not P of x.  It's a helper function that is designed to help you find probabilities by finding areas underneath it.  So when you move to the continuous world you need this intermediary to do things for you.  Last every question you ever going to ask about continuous random variables. It's going to be about intervals. If you ever don't ask about intervals, then your answer is probably going to be easier, So you're going to get tired of asking that question quite quickly.  So this is so counterintuitive, but maybe here's a way to help you back when we're doing the old version of probability and our sample spaces for nice and finite. This was our definition number of outcomes in some event divided by the total size of the sample space.  And if this is going to be 0 this fraction is 0  Can you know the denominator is finite there's only one way for that to happen. The numerator would have to be zero, right?  Same as not true when it comes to the infinite universe. So imagine a very big bag full of infinitely many balls.  Infiniti of them are white and there's one extra red ball in there.  reaching to the bag  What's the probability of pulling out the red one? Well according to this definition if you want to use it. It's one over infinity or 1 over infinity plus one or whatever and most of you will probably say that zero and you should okay. So even though you get probably the zero.  You can still do that thing as possible, right? I could get that red ball.  So probability zero you should disentangle. It doesn't mean something's impossible is used to when they're only find out how many things but as soon as you allow for infinitely many probability 0 just means that's pretty unlikely.  But still possible. Okay. Now here's the trouble basically everything about a probability 0 right?  Put one red ball and into green balls to those infinitely many white balls.  What's the probability I pull out a red ball?  0 or 1/2 infinity + 3. What's the probability of pull out a green ball?  2 / infinity plus 3 also known as  so both probabilities are zero and yet something feels wrong because there are twice as many green balls is red, right you should be twice as likely to get the green balls the red one.  And yet they both are probably 0.  Oh my goodness.  It's getting super complicated. Well one way to fix this is not to talk about their probabilities anymore cuz they're both 0.  But to start talking about their relative likelihood.  Compare them against each other.  Instead of against the universe of all possibilities sort of so when it comes to What's called the density function that we've been talking about. That's what it's doing. This access is not probability. It's missing this new term that I called density and what that's doing is trying to tell you the relative likelihood of things happening when the graph is really high. It's saying I really want to give you that value 8.2.  I want to go out to the Lord saying I don't want to give you 5.7 as much as I want to give you a point to another probably I give you any of those is.  0 but somehow things can still be relatively more and less likely as the green and red ball thing indicates.  So telling you the relative likelihood when you divide the length of these two segments is telling me something is twice as likely or three times as likely or whatever. The ratio is of those two lengths even though individually, they're all still probability zero.  What is a hard thing about infinitely many options the probability of anything is 0 and yet some things can be more or less likely to occur. Then other things. Do you need a function that sort of help somehow it encapsulated that and that's what the density function does where the graph is high. The random variable wants to spit out those numbers. I could desperately trying to give you numbers around 8.  It doesn't want to give me numbers around 13 or -2.  So, let's see how you do. Here's a little example.  The concentration of iodine in some random chemical sample is modeled by this density function.  I gave you the function. These will often be piecewise-defined. Sometimes there's only a very finite range the could actually occurred here. So this is about the concentration of iodine so I can only be between 0 and 1 which is 100% by the graph only really exist between 0 and 1 everywhere else. It just has a height of 0 it says I really really don't want to get that value ever.  Find the probability random sample has a concentration between .2 and 45 notice. It's a question about intervals.  Find the probability. It's at least point five.  Let's see how good 20b is up here.  Well, that's enough time. I think.  so it's a Hyundai sure notation is  did you write something like this the probability that your samples between 42 and 4 and 5 if you want you can use an uppercase X hear you're still thinking about the random variable. Sometimes he believes the lower case tax for particular example of it. But since I know nothing about it, it's still sort of random to me. Okay, so these days I'm sorry letters for this. Anyhow, we have three x squared from point to 2.5% the definition of probability. You need to find an antiderivative.  Hopefully this one with gentle enough.  It doesn't get any Dental ER but you realize right there at that Angie differentiation step. That could have been a nightmare function integration by parts U substitution trig sub partial fractions trig identities reduction formulas.  00  Point 117 at least five. Well, what does invest mean? Well, it means greater than or equal to you see me using the capital x here. So sometimes I go back and forth now, I went to Infinity. Did you start at Infinity?  Tell some people will jump straight from the first statement and will be like, I don't even need to waste my time in a greeting past 1 cuz guess what? There's no area past one because I had a zero. So if you'd like to jump straight to point five to one that's fine. If you want to go .5 to infinity and then take a step to reduce it. You can do that too. I do both it depends on how complicated the problem is, whether it's slow myself down or not. So here you get .875 there's a pretty good chance that your samples going to be above 50% Iodine for whatever is going on here and you can see that like most of the area under the graph is to the right of point five.  So one way to think about this picture right here is the following.  You have the graph write the density function drop a penny on it somewhere underneath the graph drop the penny maybe it dropped right there near the bottom of the F go down to the x-axis and that is the value that the little machine wants to say to you. That's the concentration of your particular sample. And whenever the graph is higher, there's a better chance that any will land under the graph there. The graph isn't very high as I'm difficult chance of Landing there. So there's another interpretation of what this is all about. Okay, so there is our first example, we've got to make things harder. Of course when we make it harder to move making the density function more complicated the distance of freshmen.  Progressive UCSD lives from the center of Campus. What's a measured in miles is modeled by this density function.  5 * e to the negative 5 x you'll notice the density function is only positive.  When were talking about positive distances and the values on the x-axis make sense? You can't live -3 miles from the center of Campus.  Cuz that's just like living three miles and turning around the other way. I suppose or something.  Okay. So let's ask a question first. Is this actually a valid density function? I just threw something crazy thing up, right?  What does it take to be a valid density function? We defined want a couple slides Argo.  First thing I better not drop below the x-axis can't have negative likelihood or densities. The other thing is you need to area under this big cookie to be one. Is it possible for the graph to go forever and still have finite area?  But you recolor did you ask that question to a bunch of 20 B students and they're like no it has to be in fit if the graph goes ever forever. That way it's got to be Infinity area. But you've done plenty of improper integrals another crazy things and I recalibrated your intuition. Let's go college. So let's go figure this out. How do you do this with first? I just say let's go find all the area under I'll start to negative infinity and I'll go to Infinity. The function is called G. No G is zero a lot of the time so you're not going to get any area particularly in all those negative values. So you can just refine it immediately and go from 0 to infinity and then put the actual function in now, you have to be a little careful. It would be very naughty.  to say negative Infinity to infinity and instead of G of x to write 5 * 80 to the negative 5 x  that's not easy because the function G is only 585 X on the positive values.  So if you're going to go negative Infinity to Infinity, you have to just write the name of the function G and then he should refine the bounds also or find the function name to what is value is.  How do you do something like this? Well, if you want to earn all the points, you can on every future assignment in this class. You need to take this improper integral with an Infinity bound and make it proper just like you did in 20 be true some letter of the alphabet.  But it is the upper bound and then push that bound off to Infinity.  This is how you do improper integrals. Once the bounds are both sort of finite fixed ideas. Then you can focus on the antiderivative.  So here the antiderivative is e to the negative 5 x with a negative sign in front.  If you don't believe that just take the derivative of what I wrote you still get eaten and -5x back but the chain rule spits out an extra -5 when it combines with the negative in front you get positive 5, which is what you're supposed to get.  Are taking this integral probably?  800 times in my life maybe more so it's pretty easy for me at this point. But I remember the first time ever took it it was a little awkward because of chain rule annoyance.  So you'll get better. This one's going to come up all the time. It's actually something super special which is why I've done it so many times now, it's all going to bounce this minus sign. I bought out in front of the limit. So I didn't have to get overwhelmed and eventually a limit problem has to be done now is that goes to Infinity the exponent? He Ronnie actually goes to negative infinity or negative 5 Infinity which is negative Infinity.  And eat it a negative Infinity if you think about the graph is just 0.  Or you can think about it just one ovary to the positive five Infinity, which is 1 over infinity, which is zero. So lots of ways to get yourself to realize that that term is going to be zero.  And we could eat at the zero with a couple minus signs on it.  Which is just Uno.  So this is actually a valid probability density function PDF.  Know whether it's useful or not whether it's accurate and is really what's going on at UCSD is another question, but at least it's something we can use the model stuff in life. So, let's see how you do on these questions.  Probability of freshmen lives exactly 3 miles from school probability lose less than one mile. How far on average?  Will a student live from the center of Campus?  See if you can do this in two minutes for sure self.  Are you bothered by that?  Okay, that's enough time probability that capital x equals 3 equals 0.  There's no probability that you actually live exactly three miles. This is back to this what we've been doing all along, right? Okay less than 1 mile or did you spray tomato? Grow? And you skip this. About the random variable part you get better if you write this thing on the left hand side and you'll see why it matters here. You're the one you probably push them things through. Okay, you can either write the exact answer 1 - e to the negative 5 and guess what? He's can show up in answers. It's quite natural pretty clear in the thing starts with n e a minute you want to round up some decimal to give people a sense of what the answer actually is.  Okay, that's helpful here 99.3% chance. Basically you within a mile. Everyone's nearby why you going to live 20 miles away?  Doesn't make any sense.  Now there's one little issue here. It's this less than or equal to and less than business.  So it turns out it doesn't matter whether these symbols right here have equal signs underneath them like a less than or equal or whether they're strict less than signs.  Okay, when you went to write the interval you rode zero to one right? You didn't like who it's like I can't really include one.  Cuz I'm not supposed to okay, if you're thinking about an equal sign here, you're worrying about the exact value of the random variable being one or not being allowed to be one how much probability is going on at 1.  No probability. So stop worrying about things that have no probability behind them.  They don't change the answer.  Now this last 100. What did you do?  You start throwing things up in the air. Like I heard people trying how can I use derivatives? Can we take some integral of something like you don't know how to do this question yet. It's about how far on averaged about the value of the random variable X.  It's not about probabilities. So none of this infrastructure is going to help so we need to figure out how to find the expected value of a continuous random variable you seen discrete ones, right? That's what that questions about on average. Would you expect to happen?  So here is what the discrete case look like. You just summed up x x How likely X was to show up. It was a weighted average.  and you do this for all the possible values of X the trouble is this definition doesn't generalize pretty  Because summations what are you going to do? What you going to run the summation over all real numbers, but I have some Nations work is it?  In fact, if you never realize this summation want discreet values that they're going to run over. I equals 1 2 3 notice all the spaces or you  Summations are not designed for a smooth range of possibilities. But you know, what is  That pretty thing they're called an integral. So all I did is I generalize the definition my summation turned into an integral.  My X carry down and we don't have a p of X function anymore. But we have a thing that helps us think about probabilities called identity function.  And some maybe if I put that there that's a reasonable thing to Define.  And it turns out they suggest the definition of the expected value whether it's a stupid definition or not is another question. They will turn out to be incredibly useful and it makes sense given the discrete case going to the continuous case.  Okay. So there we go. Somebody came in and roll probability became density seems like a reasonable definition to make now this is not an easy interval to evaluate usually first before I can even start and you can see how complicated it be, because now they're multiplying through by X. So if we go back to the problem that we was working on and you really want to do Part D.  Go from negative Infinity to Infinity Okay, g of x is 0 most of that time right? So let's just go from 0 to infinity and G of X is just 5 x e to the negative 5 x and you can see this Senegal is not so fun integration by parts. Let you be the polynomial X.  Letv B5 each of the -5x.  UV - interval of EDU  Now you laugh you're like, oh my gosh. I don't remember anything right? See this is the thing. I'm talking about. You can't keep moving forward in life when you don't really know anything from what came before eventually catches up to you and you can speak your way all the way to college. It's true. Okay, you cannot actually know anything from high school and get into college there a lot of college is out there.  They will take those sorts.  But you want to go to graduate school. If you don't actually know what happened in undergrad you get destroyed fast one weekend. You want to quit.  Anyway, either quit or you like I really got to go back and learn a new everything from graduate school. I remember this moment myself. So I know this I was not as well prepared as I should have been. Okay suck once you do the expected value the next natural thing you might wonder  Let's talk about measures of spread how spread out are the values that this machine spits out as I hit the button on it over and over and over. Okay, so he was the variance definition when we had a discrete random variable X only take on finally many values or if it took an infinitely me neither or spaces between them.  So it's not hard to figure out what to do to generalize this. Let's turn the song into an integral.  Let's change the probability function, which we don't have any more into the density function.  Seems like a reasonable thing to do.  So this is the definition of variance.  This isn't even more complicated integral to do for a lot of reasons first. See that me right there. Guess what that is.  That's expected value vacs, which is itself an integral. They must be done first before you can begin to do this interval seconds x squared appears in this order difficulty up one.  So it turns out this isn't the easiest version of the variance formula that you can find.  Oh my goodness. We tend not to use this because it's a little too complicated and there's a simpler version.  It's the following if you want to find the variance of some random variable is what you should do.  You should have been here with this expression of x squared which we'll talk about in a moment.  You should also find any of X. So there's no way around finding Evac to have two. Does it matter what version you use?  Okay, once you found it squared subtract those two.  Okay, so you proved in a 188 class why these are equivalent. It's just a bunch of horrible algebra is not fun.  And it turns out this is a lot easier to deal with and the reason is because this eve of x squared is not that hard to figure out compared to what you were going to have to deal with it right there and I'll show you in a second. But once you find variance, you can split a square root on it and you can standard deviation. So that works the same, but that's nice.  Okay. So what is the city of x squared that is an expression? That means you need to go find the cynical right here. It is an x squared in it and has an f of x.  Okay, when it was the evax on the previous slide that was an ex right there, right? Okay. So that's just the definition of what you've asked where it is.  Now I think most people would agree that doing the cylindrical right here is a little nicer than doing that one up there that also has Mew involved.  So it's the tiniest bit easier don't think this is ever going to be a piece of cake anytime. Someone asks you to find a variance. It's going to be hard work. It takes a lot of steps. I find them almost every day as I like work through various books and think about things and I always know so to brace myself emotionally.  You'll see in a second. We'll do one and you'll be like, oh my goodness. Okay, so let's try an example fidget spinner.  You flick a spinner and measure the angle. It makes from East.  In radians, you're only going to get an answer between 0 and 2pi when it comes to rest. Just sitting there, right?  Assuming each angle is equally likely find the average angle and the standard deviation of the angle.  Queso here. It's not a machine. It's a little spinner and you flick it and it comes to rest and you can measure the angle and that's the random variable. That's the thing that the burying sort of randomly and unlike the flow of air in the room in the speed at which you put your finger in like how long your fingernail is and all these other things that just added together equal perceived Randomness. Okay. Here's how we'll measure from East and you can't get something Beyond to Pi.  So the first thing that's hard about this is we need to make our own density function.  So what we need to do is take all the possible values and put them on the horizontal axis. And then we need to decide how high the grass should be.  And a higher it is it's saying it's more likely than the ones that are lower.  Now in this problem, what's interesting is your told to just assume that all the angles are equally likely.  So you might guess that the density function you should draw it's just a horizontal line. That's what usually likely would mean.  Now I have to find it to be zero outside of 0 and 2pi.  She want to make sure you think about that also.  No, we're not done because  you got to think about like how high is that grass?  How high is that graph?  Can be like a billion High?  What do you think?  1 / 2 pi a person agrees if two people think it's true that forms a trend.  I'm hoping that when you made your decision, you said the area under that thing better be one.  one of the two requirements of every density function  and you know the area formula for a rectangle.  Geometry from high school comes back by which you can see on the bottom by so that the products one.  He said facts from the pastor useful.  Okay. So here's our density function. Now. I'm writing it sort of in a algebraic notation 1/2 pi as long as you're between 0 and 2pi definition guy who really cares like  you're worrying about zero probability things again. Stop worrying about zero probability thinks yeah.  A single event actually has a value.  the probability of getting pi equals the integral from PI to Pi of f of x  Which is 0 if you do F of Pi which is what you just did you just found that the height is 1/2 Pi above this. Right here. Here's pie. You just went up and discovered the side of a graph. That's not the probability. It is so tempting to do what you just did, right?  So tempting, it seems like we finally had a positive probability for a single event. No, you never will give up on that.  So let's start doing the expected value the problem about this right now before I do this.  if you just look at the picture and think  Can you tell me what angle you think is going to occur on average? That is if everyone in the room came up here and spend the thing. You all took your numbers your angles you gave them to me and I just average them together. What do you think? We're going to get you say pie?  You think that's true?  Nazi you can't, you know, I'm going to do this, you know, I'm going to use the tone of my voice to inject doubt into you the point of doing so is so that you stop using all of my shoes and stuff and start believing in yourself.  You done the first problem on the homework yet?  Chickadee disgusting tiny near-zero answer were you bothered?  Why do you think I did that?  To break your Reliance on answers looking a certain way to believe that they're right.  Think back to first and second grade. We can even do this easy to do what do dancers look like in first and second grade integers a negative thing would be crazy, right? Okay, by the time you got to like 9th and 10th grade. What additional possibilities did you allow yourself to feel for an answer?  Directions when you got to calculus you allowed yourself to feel a little more didn't you?  You could have a square root an answer. You were a little worried.  So stop playing this game and just trust yourself cuz you know, I'm going to use every chance to exploit this mental nonsense you have any how let's go find expected value.  Now this one is super cool and easy because the function f of x is just one of her to pie and it actually comes out of the integral.  So all you're left with is a text right there. That's nice. I can integrate x I get 1/2 x squared.  I can plug in the upper and lower bounds and subtract them. Skip all that stuff and you get pie.  believe in yourself  and sometimes dangles come up a little short of the halfway mark and sometimes they go a little past the halfway mark Wright.  So that's the easier thing now, I'm guessing most people in the room have no intuition about what the standard deviation should be either very hard things to predict. So let's just go find it. It's right here. It's called pie.  If you want to try to get back there, that's fine. Also, whatever you like. So we need to find any of x squared and I told you that that formulas are given as x squared x f of x with an integral in front of ex is still this nice gentle function 1/2 Pi which is comes out.  So let's antidifferentiate get 1/3 x cubed and plug in the upper and lower bounds.  the one danger  Here's some metacognition for you this archive mission, right? You're doing steps procedures. There's metacognition. When you do a variance calculation, you will have already done an expected value calculation backs to get Mew you will also went and did ye of x squared this will feel lots of time and lots of page. Right? So you are most likely to forget to actually go back and actually calculate the variance and take the two pieces and put them together in the formula at the top of the right side.  So notice about this procedure that is dangerous and that your bandwidth get so overly overloaded with all this other plaid that you forget to do what you actually asked to do.  So when you bring any of x squared together with Eve X quantity squared and subtract them that gives you the variance.  And it's probably wanted the standard deviation. Did you already forget what measure of spread it wanted way back a long time ago.  Time is an interesting variable in solving problems. So it turns out the standard deviation here is pi over the square root of 3, would you have guessed that?  Okay, that's about 1.81 RADS. And I've drawn if you remember what one radian equals 59 degrees or something?  Then I drew about 1.8 of those so you can see like we're going to get the blue on average but values through this red span and that red span would be quite common.  So you've done your first expected value variance standard deviation density function will learn.  Later and 181a. Will you join me for having taken? 180a?  I guess you won't join me for 181 am in the winter. Anyhow, here's the density function for the chi-squared df6. Whatever that means.  I don't want to show you where everything is. So the expected value is still the balance point.  Okay. So for this graph it happens to be at 6, so if you cut this out of cardboard and student on your finger now, that's not the same as where the highest point is. They could overlap. They don't have to the highest point called the mode. So here it's for  And the standard deviation sorta gives you a range of what the reasonable values are along the x-axis that you get most of the time.  There you go. Have a great weekend. "
