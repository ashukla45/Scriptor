    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back everyone.  I'm a little sick today. So I'm going to do my best but I didn't have time to shave all pretty for you this weekend. Sorry cuz I was too sick second part of chapter 7.  So so where we at we done correlation coefficient from weird number to measure the strength of a linear idea. You have a regression line, but we don't know how to find it yet. We just pulled around a bunch of points within the last class right? So, let me set up some notation first. So the regression line is just a normal line from Master y equals MX plus b, right, but I'm going to write the vision first.  And I'm going instead use the notation be sub zero plus be someone.  The value of doing this notation, is it this generalizes? So if you ever going to fit a quadratic model, you can immediately guess what the next term would need to be that you would out on b 2 x squared.  If you don't start subscribing things you quickly run out of letters letters of the alphabet for your coefficients, which is foolish and model is making a prediction. So why have always seemed like something that was on your actual regression line?  Okay, and that's what station that means now b0 here is the intercept and every line as an intercept and you can figure out what it is by just plugging an x equals zero the weather in intercept actually makes any sense for your regression line is a different question, which will see in a moment. The be one here is the slope of the line one way to think about it is if I change one unit on the x-axis, how many units will I go up or down on the y-axis? So does a nice interpretation when you simply know what's on the axes which is kind of fun.  Okay. Now none of this helps me actually find the regression line. It just gives me a new variables and change the problem to tell me what b0 and B1 are and they don't know what they're Gresham line is so when you get to a class like 181b.  Or maybe even higher you will finally prove how to find the regression line. It turns out it has a nice closed formula believe it or not and it just depends on a few things. So be one will always be equal to r x s m y over a sub X  At this stage like I'm not going to prove this for you, but I can give you some intuition why you should believe what I've written here.  The first is that the slope might be positive in might be negative and ours effectively getting the correct sign on the slope you remember there are as positive if the association so it goes up as you read from left to right and vice-versa for negative ours. And what does s o y n s o x r which of the standard deviation of the Y ideas in the essay ideas the units on the idea, correct? Slope should be a change in y over change in x  So it better have y i y units over X units as its units.  So this is how I remember B1. Okay. I remember the horrible derivation through some complicated Matrix calculus that does this which is what you do one day. It just makes a lot of sense, but all the pieces have to be there.  Okay. Now how do you find b0? Well, the cool thing is if you find B1 first, then you could find b0 if you just knew a single point that the line went through that you were sure it went because then you would have everything in the equation except for one thing. Okay. So be one is known and you have an XY hat the line goes through you can solve for b 0 by just moving things around and it turns out that the regression line will always  Go to x bar, Y Bar.  The line is trying to summarize what's going on? So it sort of has to do with best job and getting the average X idea right paired up with the average. Why idea would be very weird for the line not to get the averages parotid map to each other now. It's also not easy to prove that that point is always on the line.  Maybe believed it when I told you it was intuitive. If so, great. If not,  Weight for a horrible proof one of these days if coming up in your future if you do more stuff. Okay now obviously you can see  In order to find b0 and B1 you would have to know are horrible nightmare sysx Xbox Live all horrible nightmares. So you went up to doing everything with technology to find is anyway, but the cool thing is that technology can basically do it in a very quick time just have to calculate all of these numbers for you and call you computer science Majors. You can tell me the Big O of all these different operations. They're basically o of n where n is the number of data points roughly and so we're not talking about, you know, I need to try all possible lines in the universe which is an O of infinity, basically.  Okay, so let's go to Old Faithful here.  You saw last class, right?  Look familiar to anybody about a good someone check their head. Yes, that must be in the whole room is fine teacher mistakes 101. So if use technology, you can figure out that the time you have to wait to see that next eruption is 33.83 + 10.74 times the length of the last eruption.  So I need someone to help me understand what the slope and intercept of this line mean.  And I'll make it even harder by you have to use units as you talk to us.  Is that  Go ahead.  What kind of minutes?  Minutes I can hold my breath.  someone clean that up a little  go ahead.  The first eruption this is been going on forever in life.  Go ahead clean up.  What kind of minutes?  O minutes of waiting. I hate waiting minutes. I love minutes of being on my snowboard but I hate waiting minutes good and what is so what is represento?  impossible good  That was very nice. So if the length of the last eruption was 0 minutes.  Which makes no sense?  It would take about 34 minutes of waiting.  Imaginary eruption was like instant Escalade short, then you'll be sitting there for 34 good. So it's waiting minutes.  the other number  go ahead.  for every minute of eruptive action  You will wait roughly 10 minutes before the next eruption happens on average the model predicts blah blah blah.  Okay, good. That's what all those things are. Going to be. Very careful like minutes not all minutes are created equal.  No, it's not unitless minutes over minutes for a child cancel and give you nothing but eruptive minutes and waiting minutes are different kinds of minutes.  Say to be very careful about the cancellation. It doesn't actually occur. Okay, anyhow, and then hear minutes until next / minutes of last.  It don't want those extra pesky words attached a minute to be exactly right.  That's did you ask me that because of something on the homework you were worried about.  Oh, well, you just help some people on the homework get something a little more correct? And they might have that was very sweet of you. Yeah, you're welcome everybody raising your grades and stuff. So back here at let's do this example. Now, these are hundreds of UCLA women. They we are looking at their heights and weights who were part of the UCLA women's study.  Guy so you can build a regression line here. I'll give it to you -111 + 3.51 * height. You can tell what being predicted what's on the y-axis by the hat. So apparently were trying to predict weight based on Heights. So immediately, I know from The Intercept that if you happen to be 0 inches tall and your UCLA woman your weight will be negative 111  Guy that has the interpretation. Obviously. It doesn't actually make any real-world sense, but you should think about it is sort of a starting place for the model.  Kind of model wants to start at 0, negative 1:11, and then it's going to build and it will build through a lot of nonsensical values, but it's still the way to interpret it. If it makes no sense. The other thing the slope is always a change of my Ever Changing acts. So if you want you can think about the 3.5 s / Island one. So for every inch you increase our UCLA women Tight Fittin to weigh on average about three and a half pounds more  You could also think about the other way. What if you decrease by 1 inch they should weigh less so there's lots of ways to rethink the number 3.5 if you increase your height by 2 suddenly, they weigh 7 pounds. So the slope has many interpretations questions. You might want to ask at this point is  why would I ever build a model?  And for some people it's really obvious because you've dealt with things before in life that models are helpful with but I'll show you some examples here perhaps why is really hard or expensive to measure but if it is tightly linked to another idea called acts which is cheaper Easy. Why not measure the cheap easy thing and then extrapolate out to figure out what why is roughly going to be in if you don't need a super precise measure for y,  Then you can use in XY relationship to get you what you want. They may be why can only be measured after the fact Damage Done by tornado? But guess what you're the president and something bad is just happened and you have to decide how much money should be allocated how many human beings should go there? So if you had some model of the last 5000 disasters you can use that to predict what you should do in the current one. That's just under a hurricane is on its way. What would you do?  Hopefully the model to help you decide okay move from your data set to a larger universe ever wonder how much you weigh if you were seven and a half feet tall.  Don't you think about these things?  Well, there you go. You can use a model to extrapolate or even interpolate two values. You don't have and there's a last one. I love this the most parts of the model might answer questions you have about some issue.  So, for example, we just saw it the height weight graph. It tells you roughly would an inch of human being should weigh.  But why would you ever care so I'll give you two reasons why you might care. So here's the first.  If you are in the military, there's this thing called maximum weight chart when you go above the maximum. Goodbye. They don't want you anymore because you're too heavy to perform the duties that they've decided need to be performed and somehow they have to make this chart, right? Okay. So you just list all the heights down the center and then maybe you have the forethought to separate it out by gender because maybe an inch of human being ways different in your binary gender Universe. Okay, great. So basically all you care about is the starting value. You just need to move forward and keep adding roughly the same amount on that's what an inch of human being ways.  Okay. She look over here in the women's side a lot of these additions or numbers around 4 or 3.  Sometimes a five will get thrown in for some weird reason cuz of rounding issues. But anyhow, there it is every inch of human being for UCLA women.  It's about three and a half pounds. Now. This could be really fun. For example you and your best friend. Love going to the gym and getting huge.  And you always want to compare and see who's more. There's just one problem you and your friend are different heights.  So how do you decide who's more jacked will first do we calibrate your hat Heights? So they're the same by adding or subtracting the appropriate number of 3.5?  If you want to see you see like woman's number or you can like figure it out based on what you want to do. So now you can decide who's more jacked you or your friend. Okay? Let's see how you do here.  Here's the model, right? Let's see how well it predicts you so plug in your height. Hopefully you're in inches person cuz that's what the model set up as sorry centimeter people.  Then find a residual then try to explain why it was wrong or not.  Need a calculator.  Wow, you weigh 96 lb.  Okay, who wants to tell us about your data  Someone is comfortable sharing their rates data.  I'd like to know what the model predicted for you and how much you actually weigh.  118.9 lb how much you actually weigh?  135 hey, that's kind of terrible.  So why didn't the model sucks for you?  the other hemisphere  this is a very particular data set.  Which state is that was it?  I can't even you're just saying exactly what you're saying.  What was the status at?  No one UCLA women dude, identify that way.  I don't know which bits of you.  I mean I never went to Harvard but maybe identify that way.  All my best friends teach there. So, you know know so here's my number. So I'll put mine in 6-speed. That's how tall I am today. Oh my goodness, I should weigh 141 but sadly, I weigh 170 actually weigh 170 8.3 but you know, whatever change the Flies based on the day I wake up.  So the residual take your true value and subtract the models prediction so mines positive. So that means that I weigh more than the model which makes sense because the model is doing 3.5 lb, but that's not really what describes me very well. Maybe if we didn't like UCLA men it would have been closer.  Okay, let's go to Socrative 1 through 5. How do you do?  Can you get them all that's the question?  Oh.  Oh, okay. Someone's in the room C scatter plot on screen. What might each. Represent?  Can you hear my heartbeat?  I like how that's the conclusion you drew.  I'm dead-ass clearly what it is. How do we do?  Okay, so we are measuring two features about things whatever we're trying to measure should have a percent poverty rate and an annual murder rate per million. So a metropolitan area is probably  the wisest choice for this answer. You probably would have chose chosen per million people if using a small town, although you could have it would just be a little strange America's 20th richest city.  They probably don't have these kinds of poverty rates. If you look at the data around cities, you'll notice that okay.  Oh, no.  Guess the correlation coefficient of the sky. Oh, my phone just came in an hour ago, by the way, it's waiting for me at home. I can't wait.  Have you been what?  My friend sent me a text. It says if you need my help learning how to do Android stuff. I can help I was like I sent him text messages a day and make one phone call a week. I think I'm going to be okay.  I hate cell phones so much.  How do I been playing the game?  How do we do nothing playing the game enough? I guess guess the correlation coefficient. Com.  It said here .84, right? Yeah, okay, if we change the y-axis, so the units are now annual murders per hundred thousand.  What will the correlation be for our scatterplot now?  On the test. Will you have guess the correlation problems?  It'll be 10 pages of nothing about that.  When that be fun, I love you. Terrible. Okay, good most the classes. It doesn't matter. If you change the scaling multiplying the y-axis idea by 10 changes it to 400,000 instead of million that does nothing you were told. This is the regression What annual murder rate per million people do we expect based on the model 20% poverty rate?  Etsy  can you do it in your head?  Are you ashamed of using the calculator now?  You should eliminate shame as an emotion. You feel life is so much better.  imagine what that would be like  No more shame emoji.  No more shaming people.  But yeah, how does a citation shame people if the concept of Shame doesn't exist in it? Interesting 22 digit numbers. Boom, right? Okay, finally Mark the statements below that are correct interpretations.  There could be more than one answer.  Oh, yeah, the final were also kratom.  A new question is released every 2 minutes for 3 hours straight.  Stampy Crazy  Oh my goodness.  Okay, you probably saw what she isn't right amount of Billtown metropolises. You probably don't want to plug in any City.  Oh, yeah, I know such a key the only values and you can do whatever you want with a tool. I can take a screwdriver and use it to knock and nails.  Doesn't mean it was a good choice the good choices to use it based on the values of the model was built on you can see the models built between 14 and 26. So that would be a reasonable collection of values that you might plug in if you want to extrapolate and go outside those Balance. You're welcome to but it's dangerous. How do you know the line doesn't change and start getting Kirby?  Thereafter that's the danger of extrapolation.  yummy data  Okay. Now we have to talk about this weird Trend with someone noticed Once Upon a Time.  So let me show you something first.  You been thinking about be one as a number and wanted to number you can think about it is if I change ex-spy won the changes Why by that number?  guy, but you can also think about D1 based on how it's what it actually has two equal r x s y a r s x  So what this says if you think about this way is if you change the X idea by one standard deviation.  Then the line will change by our standard deviations in the y direction.  Interesting. So if your standard deviation above the average height, do you think that's you?  Then you should be our standard deviation. There are times 1 standard deviations above the average weight and you can also do the same idea with X Constance and going to Below on the X idea and standard deviations moves you two are  Standard deviations down in the y direction now. So what what's interesting about that you say?  Well as soon as you recall that are as a number between -1 and 1 and usually isn't -1 + 1.  when it says if you move one standard deviation in X is supposed to be moving our standard deviations in the y direction, but ours less than 1  you would think that moving one standard deviation and action also movie One standard deviation and why but it turns out it's simply not the case.  So what happens is you try to move out in the X Direction thinking about standard deviation moves?  You move out in the wind direction using standard deviations, but it all gets scaled down by a factor of whatever our is.  When people use the phrase regression to the mean to describe this the points as you spread out in the X Direction want to pull in toward what's going on in the Y Direction More than you expect they should.  So here's a little picture that shows what's going on. So let's say you have two tasks in the quarter in the first test just happened and you go and you look at all the best students on test-1. Can you identify them and then you follow them and you watch what happens on Test 2 and here's what happens all your top scorers sort of spread out.  I just happens when you look at the data they regressed and pulled toward the mean when you look at them the second time OU Sports people might even noticed this or felt this in your soul guy. So you look at sound like previous season the tap and the last season's a and you look at the worst batting average people in MLB, like look at all these terrible Players. Let's follow them and see what happens in the upcoming season. Well, once the upcoming Seasons done and you wash where they go all the people at the bottom shirts pulling toward regressing to the red line.  And it's just a phenomenon whenever you measure something and it already exists and then you follow those people who are extreme examples. They start being less extreme when you re measure them.  And it's really weird. The reason that started is people used to think that if your parents were tall you should be tall and then they just started measuring Heights of parents and their kids and they noticed it really really tall parents. Don't always give rise to really tall kids. Sometimes they do. Okay, that's like the bar the arrow going straight across but then the children seemed to be a little less tall for some reason they regressed on their height. So that was the historical beginning of this and you might be like and how could this possibly occur? Will the mathematics say it should if you take people that are way crazy on the height Spectrum the parents 3 standard deviations away either high or low and you go watch their kids height on the y-axis. You could pull then toward the meme. It's not three standard deviations away here 3r.  And ours lesson one, right so far. We're like .7 now. It's 3 * 27 or 2.1. So now the kids are only about two standard deviations above the average. So here's the explanation to be exceptional on some measure the first test the last batting average season exceptional either good or bad exceptional and you need a lot of luck. You need elements to be in place. For example, you need to not have any injuries That season  Okay, you need to come up against the pictures that you just happen to be good against her bad against.  This is a lot of elements that make it up. So when you go read measure people they still have their ability either good or bad, but maybe the luck elements are not there anymore. When you look at people that are super tall. Well their parents probably gave him great jeans and everything just came to be genetically and epigenetically, but then when you look at their kids, maybe the kid didn't get all the perfect jeans and all the elements about making Hyatt weren't there maybe didn't have the right nutrition. Maybe the world ran out of food.  For your kids. Sorry not going to be at all. Just looking at statistics.  So it takes a lot. So when you re-measure people they won't be guaranteed to have it again is all this going on.  Okay. So regression to the mean it's just a phenomenon that's interesting to know and you can see it sort of through data or to the formulas. Now, you might wonder actually allowed to build a model. We just been doing it. But what about those?  pesky conditions  Why?  So here the four conditions if you ever want to build a straight line for some data number one.  The data should look roughly linear. Don't put a line through something Kirby.  Obvious, right?  You should see what people actually do out there in the world.  Seawright. Okay. What's  this picture event has like a shading to show the trend pattern of the data. So it doesn't feel any air at all. Next thing histogram of the residual should be nearly normal. We'll see that in a moment. The next is something called constant variability around the line. So if there were a perfect line to draw through this you don't want the data sort of fan out away from the line As you move from left to right or vice versa.  The reason you don't want that is because you're still missing something in your analysis. If it's Fanning out you're missing the fact that the variability keeps changing.  So while a line might be the best thing to put through the fan.  Maybe you want to also think about the variability and do something about that which you do with more Advanced Techniques later. But anyhow, so right now we don't want any variability around that line and finally independent observations. Okay, if you're going to study height and weight  And you want to generalize to the whole world don't go to UCLA.  Maybe UCLA feeds people strange food the ties their height and weight together, but the rest of the country doesn't or something weird like that. So as you're choosing people that you're measuring the two things on the go on the axis, make sure they're just would have randomly chosen.  Okay time series data often violate this so if for example, let's see here.  How exhausted I am and the temperature outside after 12 noon.  Okay. So as time goes on after 12 noon, my level of exhaustion just keeps Climbing doesn't it? But it's not because of the temperature. It's actually because the time I think it's later in the day. I get exhausted and I have to wait for 17-18 hours. That's what's causing it. So if your data are somehow tied to time then what you could actually be measuring is the defective time.  And what it does to things so you want to avoid data that are strongly dependent on time. Now, what's the histogram of residuals amount? So we have to make one of these so here's a graph of all the different items at Starbucks - seasonal items like pumpkin spice lattes.  Standard menu items calories you can have something to do with how many carbs are in it.  No, we can eat infinite carbs and it doesn't affect the calories. Okay, so are all the items, right so it put the line through.  Now one of the line down every single point will have a residual the distance vertically from that point. Some of them were positive that lightbulb summer negative what you can do as you can take all those residuals and create a residual plot here. It is the same distances have been mapped over here and you notice a zero on this axis is the residuals. Okay. So that point tied to that point the way I think about it sort of is take the picture on the left and sort of  Like that, sir, drop it down. The problem is like it's not exactly because then you know these things would like the residual little thing turns A Little Priest imagine like it all falls down and it's like  I thought  like I said the line and the Sea here basically becomes this x and x axis a20 there. So that's one thing to do and we would really like this residual plot to be just look like noise to have no pattern. If you still see a pattern in the residual what it means is you took something you should try to wait a linear idea from it and it is still see a pattern it's cuz it wasn't linear to start with.  for example math  Who's your data? Follow x squared plus 3x - 4  And you say okay. Let's subtract away a line and you subtract away 3x - 4 well with your left over with his x squared you still see a quadratic pattern and things so that's why you don't want to see a pattern there.  Cuz it means you missed the idea in the first place. It wasn't really linear to begin with.  Not if you want you can go drop all those residuals.  Those numbers those distances above and below a bunch of positive and negative stuff. You can go drop them into a picture if you want.  And we would really really like to see normality in this picture.  Okay, histogram of residuals is nearly normal. So that's how you could see normality to the blue thing. You'll also want to carefully check that there's no pattern in this thing in the middle called the residual plot cuz this would be problematic.  But as long as you really are something linear, you're going to see a bunch of noise here, which is great.  It's so what did you saying? It's basically.  How far the observations vary from the line, is there usually quite close.  Near zero residuals and it's becoming increasingly rare to see things kwesi below or crazy above the line.  That's all it's going on here. Okay, so that that's why I look for the nearly normal condition known as you can also see this Fanning out effect that we talked about earlier. You can often see it in the residual plot. Okay, if there's a fan here when you Tilt The Fan down it's still a fan.  So there it is, but that would be bad if you did that so.  another issue that comes up  when you're making the lines as what do I do if I have an outlier?  Well, that's super complicated. So let me show you.  Why is it so hard?  I get the connection to not fall apart when I move one in computer while it's so fragile.  So what are you about this?  There's a bunch of dots all the same pattern and then one little. Hanging out all by itself.  Should we build a regression line through this?  So I want you to imagine your head first building the line using all the points in the picture and then separately with a green color line in your head.  Just using the points and not the outlier.  Do you have it in your head?  See it.  To close your eyes. You can see things better.  That's because then you see all this this is like so much input into my brain right now processing all of your faces and all of your reactions and everything is going on but you close your eyes then you can see on the back of your eyes and you can boom.  Don't overload your bandwidth with visual things.  Okay. Anyhow, here's what you probably do, right?  Those are the actual lines if you just type it into our something and do it pretty similar, right? So you're so worked up about this outlier, but it really doesn't change the answer almost at all. So who cares?  Davis try another 100  Do you see it?  You want to show us what you see with the laser pointer?  So draw me push the green button right there. Don't even people's eyes.  So give us the orange one with all the points.  How and when just the non outlier points?  Okay, hit the advancement button. Yeah, so the right how'd you do?  I mean you did bad.  bad  Then basically what you said sort of you and the tilt of the orange a little off, but you're not a supercomputer last time I checked so, you know, I would have probably said something close to what you said. I don't know now, they're starting to look a little different right? So now you might be worried. So what you could do if you could run the analysis twice.  With and without the outlier hand them over to your boss and say it wasn't sure what to do about that because I don't know if it's real data or not. Maybe it's actual person and they definitely deserve to be in your data set starting amount would be bad. Maybe it's a troll in the room who gave you silly data by Socrative and they definitely don't it beat deserve to be there keeping them would be bad. So there's nothing right answer about what to do here. I can just show you that in some cases. It doesn't matter don't get workout or if you're super workout make a decision or don't make a decision and pass it on to the next guy or gal. Who's above you.  Let them decide. Okay. Anyhow, here's the last one.  cast of see the line both lines on the slides  hold the line right there and all the dance it and we'll see if your mental things lands on top.  You seem both.  Got them.  Hold it.  Hold them in your brain project them over.  You ready?  Is that the booze from this weekend?  No.  Okay, I just went to the eye doctor last week. I was a hot mess for me to tell you.  I have this new thing that like they want to dilate to any more of these take this like thing and it looks can the inside of your eyeballs some 3D picture.  And he's like, hey, you're about to turn 40, aren't you? And he's like it so it begins the degradation is about to start.  We have a very good like you can talk to me like that.  So it does you can actually show me in the 3D pictures like he said in your your left eye you can see the blood vessels clogging with stuff but in the right eye doesn't happen cuz left eye is closer to the heart. So all the cholesterol goes to your left eye first. I know it's crazy. So hopefully you're not saying anything everyone in the room with the green line, right? The orange line is very difficult to determine you need a computer basically to decide that  Now there's something different about these points, right? You probably felt this in your stall know. Maybe you don't have the language. So I'm going to introduce the language of Leverage and influence.  So a high-leverage point.  Warning big language ahead is simply one with the x value of the point is really far from the average of the data points that are going on in new dataset. So for example, this one right here, if you drop it down the x-values like 25 and the average x-values around 7 or 8.  So high leverage, you should think about a seesaw. It's someone who's going to go sit really really far on the other end of the Seesaw away from you. They can exert a lot of lever arm.  Now whether they do or not is another question. So in the first two examples, you see both of these have high leverage cuz they're really far away but to decide if they're high influence, you need to figure out both of the lines the green and the orange and if they're really different.  Whatever that means then you have something with high influence if it significantly changes the slope of the regression line when it's included versus excluded. Okay. So for example when my nephew sits on the extreme end of the Seesaw he has the potential to create a lot of lever, but does he actually influence things?  No, because he weighs like 40 lb and I weigh 170 8.3.  And I overwhelm what's going on in this picture the metaphor is that the point follows the trend that the Thousand other points already established, so it doesn't influence it. It just lives with that Trend but in the middle here, it was very high influence example. This is a point with less leverage. Okay, it's pretty close to the center. Like it has an x value around 4 and looks like it's about 6 on average right? So it's not that far out doesn't have a huge lever arm to it. Now it can still damaged things.  Put a 20000 pound elephant one in from the center of the fulcrum. Goodbye. You're gone, right?  So I can label this as low leverage moderate influence. So now you have some qualitative things to describe what's going on.  Okay, so I don't do regressions when I have high influence outliers. I go talk to a boss and say what do you want to do? We have a hot mess in front of us.  And then together use your wisdom.  So I can show me how to do any of this in our yet. Why don't we try that back to Old Faithful back to the Hutchinson data set from our good old geologist.  And time until next and time of last.  First thing should we actually do a linear regression here? Can we meet those pesky conditions? Well, here's some pictures to help you decide.  First to the dots look straight enough for you.  You shake your head. Yes, we'll just keep going then.  One person thinks is true, right? Okay. Next thing does the histogram of the residuals? What kind of normal ich will keep going with you? What do you think you say? Yes, what's the next condition?  Which we just said that one.  What's what's third?  Equal spread throughout the problem. So look, if you look at how much you have to go up and down. It's kind of the same the whole way right?  And then that last one independent, what do you think?  Do you think our old are Hutchinson just said? Okay, I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll just collect 20 data points in a row and guess what he did or she  Maybe Old Faithful is only faithful on Tuesdays.  And on Wednesdays, it's crazy insanity.  So you have to know how the data is collected in order to decide this Independence on the same day. That would be very bad. Probably now. They're all tied to a Tuesday in Old Faithful only works on Tuesday something something something but let's just you know, whatever. Let's just hope it's fine and just move on you said yes to everything those pesky conditions. So what are you doing? So first I tell em, I'd like to make a linear model. That's what LMK stands for over here. It says what's the name of the dataset? This will be a data table. Do you have in our Old Faithful?  And then this will look like what we did with a Nova sort of what variable would you like to predict?  The time you have to wait until the next eruption and then you put the tilde and it said what's on the x-axis. What's our predictor variable that's helping us make a prediction and that's length of last. Okay, then Archer and stuff out if I had the line of best fit and so on okay and then spits the results and I stored in something called model and if you just do summary of model.  Then it will go and it will print out this beautiful little table.  Oh, he was table of numbers. What could it possibly mean?  So there's the word intercept next to 33.82.  That's probably the intercept right length of last. It has some coefficient estimate on that. So what is trying to do in this column of numbers is give you everything you need to build not only b0 and B1 but to use those to effectively build the equation of the line.  okay, so basically  the intercept  You should think about as The Intercept of the line is named using about the next ID listed as the X idea. What's on your x axis?  And if you were going to build a quadratic model, then the next thing would be the length of last squared it be the x squared idea and a coefficient that should be in front of that.  Okay, so that's how you pull out of the equation from this guy and all this other stuff will use next class.  We got to stop.  I'm going to my phone.  I'll see you guys. "
