All the homework Store now done. So it must feel good.  And so that means all the old homework from last quarter have been released. If you want to go work a hundred pages of more problems cuz you love working problems. Like I do anyhow, so it's time for us to start making inferences about linear regression last topic.

I want to measure are there height and their weight the UCLA women's study. Okay, so you can put a beautiful little straight line for the data, assuming that they're straight enough quantitative variables and all those other conditions, right?  And when you do this you get some line.  Now here's the thing. I got to think about that line is based on a sample of data.  draw different sample  get a different line.  Oh my goodness. So this particular negative 111 here. Yeah, that's the intercept for this data set, but we could have gone a different dataset.  So that's mean to the population. What did you took every single woman ever that went to UCLA?  Or that ever will go to UCLA will go into the past and the future and just grab everyone right?  So if you took everyone and you drop those billions of data points or however many, I don't know how long until a will survive for a college education in general but shopping mall in the whole population. You could put a line through those and you would get the True Values.  for the intercept and the slope  When you know, it's me to sing the Greek notation.  that should feel population in so there's beta 0 and beta 1  Now to remind you, this is what we were doing. We were just this little thing that pulled from the cloud people.  And we got busier on B1.  Okay, they might wonder how big is Iran D1 could very if you keep drawing more samples, so you could imagine that process happening in just a little rate it for every single window get a different because you're going to be one.  I've written her same expression here.  Cuz I didn't want to double e subscript things.  But you can imagine those different values for b0 and B1 committed to have different samples from all the different possible things that could ever happen dump them into a picture of a sampling distribution.  I beautiful.  If you do the same thing for all the bee ones you would get a sampling distribution that shows you how the slope of the regression line varies as the data set that build the slope varies.  That's what it's doing distribution for B1. These used to be things called like P hat.  And X bar, but now it's just a more complicated setup. So what I want to do today is think about what their shapes are.  I'm guessing you can guess it already.  Where they're spread out how spread out they are where they're centered and those pesky conditions that make sure we actually get the beautiful picture that I say we do.  We're not going to do it for both the red and the green because who really cares about getting the intercept super super precise.  I mean usually intercept is a silly Valor you anyway, right?  -111  do you really care about figuring out the weight of a 0 inch person wheelie carefully?  that's what the negative energy negative 111 is doing so we're going to focus on the slope and  And almost everyone studies be one who does anything with linear regression.  Tell person where do you think it's centered?  That is when we build linear regressions and we look at the slopes what value does the universe desperately want to give us?  R. X formulations y r x s y over x x that's the exact formula will get from the sample now depends what you mean by Sy and SX do you mean the standard deviation in the sample?  Show the universe.  There's one great answer.  Is there an easier? Yep beta 1?  If 81 is what happens when you use everybody if you just use a small percentage of them, you want to get a value near Bay to one Universe wants to give you something, but you're not what you said is also true, but just more complicated OK Google.  Turn a better one. Now. How spread out will this universe be now, you're not going to guess your way into this stuff. We're talking 181b horrible disaster.  Kind of stuff so the spread of this distribution.  Turns out to be this formula.  Oh my goodness.  So this is this is SME as a standard deviation of the residuals when you build some particular line based on some particular data.  You could go have a bunch of residuals. These are the small amounts above and below. All the points are from the line.  Those are just numbers distances and you can figure out their standard deviation.  What S Sub X. Well you have all these data points, right? And if you just drop them down onto the x-axis, then they're just numbers on the x-axis. So they have a spread out.  So that's what is fx's and finally \u221a n -1 and his number of data points. So this gives an approximation for house, but out this green picture is going to be  it tells you how much variability could possibly come.  out of the sub approximation when making for B1  The last thing I have to know.  Is what career best approximates the screen universe?  Now you can take normal look for New Normal, doesn't it?  But by now that you have a little more caution.  I don't look exactly normal.  Maybe some T distribution right T distribution circle out like normal distributions and those tend to be more accurate. So it's going to turn out that piece of N - 2  Against some artifact of some 20-page proof or some dimensionality thing is lost from end-to-end -2 in the middle of an argument.  Very hard to give intuitive understanding for that actress point.  This is something I have memorized.  And the last thing is do we always get a beautiful t-distribution not if you have a garbage sample not if you don't meet those pesky conditions, so anytime we meet the four conditions are necessary to build a regression model.  Then you also get an iced tea distribution here and you can use it to do any kind of inference you would want.  so  this will tell us how the slope of the regression line could possibly very  Okay, the universe wants to give you a better one or something near it but it can go a little higher a little lower. So this will allow you to be more precise about what's really going on with this. Hope of your line.  rose fine example hair  figure out how much an inch of an American ways  Warriors and status to every person. That's an American whatever that means.  Cut the height weight and put that 300.  40 million points and a picture of the answer  The other option is to not go as 350 million people what they believe and what they are.  I understand. Do I to 250 simple random sample so conditions?  necessary to build a regression model  And for doing inference, someone talk me through the conditions and if you think we got him or not.  Number one doesn't look band out to you. So that means there's a consistent variability across.  great enough  interesting thing right after you put a line through it. I can put a line through anything right if you say it.  Go ahead.  Histogram of residuals witches show nowhere is nearly normal. What do you think?  This is the residual plot is different than a histogram.  So what you need to do if you need to take this picture.  Rotated 90\u00b0. So the residuals are not on the y-axis, but instead of the X after it's rotated let the points All Fall Down.  And it'll keep me late and do a picture the histogram.  So, how do you see it? Well, if it's going to be normal, you need most of the dots near the dash line near zero and as we move out a way to crazier and crazier values, I need to see fewer and fewer dots do you feel like that's happening?  independent something something  dating site can't be garbage.  Observations observations are human beings. Don't call them observations.  Notify everyone does so what do you think?  Did we do it to an independent?  hiring now  10% in SRS. So there goes that some Randomness and there's more than 2,500 Americans.  I don't know about that any more than that. Maybe you can just see it from the residual plot like we were talking about. Okay, here we go. I ran out. We got this stuff.  Slope intercept that should be easy now where they mean. Go ahead.  You have to meet this condition before coming.  Yes, it's a chicken-and-egg problem in order to decide if there's constant variability around a line.  You got to draw the line and you're currently deciding whether you should be allowed to draw the line or not going to happen. So it doesn't change its just sitting there. Right? So you could imagine like what if I did draw the best line.  Okay, there's where it goes now. Should I agree on that?  Use it to help you decide.  Great question. It's okay. Don't get worked up.  My God is cough after so good.  If I don't keep eating them, it's going to get bad earlier.  I had to stop class because it was so bad.  I'm just too fragile for the world.  Okay, slope-intercept.  No one knows what they are and what they mean. It's hopeless give up.  Beautiful you gain 3.382 pounds for whom?  This is the key moment for whom what do you say?  for a theoretical predicted American  this fact  come from this lot.  this line comes from  this sample  So for a theoretical predicted person who would fix the current sample 3.32 lb to a person's weight in our sample as with the models predicting, that's the key moments right there that we were careful about before.  So why would it be inappropriate to make the claim you just make?  That is true for any American.  Sample may not be representative sample may not be representative of all of America. Okay, that's good and samples of variability, right? So even though you do an SRS, which should be representative of the whole thing. They're still variability when you draw srs's  So we need to be a little more subtle if we're going to make the claim about America versus to start sample and the theoretical people that might fit it.  Okay.  So we're going to use in Frontier to help lift our results from what we found in our sample up to a greater good.  Oh my goodness. That's what insurance is all about. Right so our best guess right now for beta 1 which is a fact about All-American sets with beta-1 does  Rpac be one is for a 250 people. That's our best guess. So what we can do is we can use the fact that there's some t-distribution going on to lift it up and give a responsible Zone 4 beta.  I don't know about America businesses owned that can cause a pretty good chance of talking about America. So we're going to take it.  The particular distribution wear on T 7-2 and there's some spread out anise to that distribution that shows how B1 berries on it.  We got a particular B1 and we'll just think about the variation now, so you have to go and do this expression right? Here be one plus or minus and now I'm writing a c formula which admittedly is all dirty.  Arena are so dirty.  Is because it involves things like the standard deviation of the residuals.  And you're probably not going to figure that out by hand write. The only way you figured that out is by taking the whole day to said somehow fitting the best line through it after you've done that to all the subtractions above and below and then take all those numbers and run them through a standard deviation formula.  That sounds like something I'd never do by hand and backed I never have  Thank goodness. You live in the computer generation, right?  Now when you do things in our the cool thing is the print out that we saw the other day will not only tell you the regression line was right here the first things but it will also have all the other information you really need. So you've been using it so far to extract out b0 and B1 What's My Line with my weird date is that  all right, here are the standard errors for those ideas b0 and B1. So we really care about this bottom number.  tires SE AP1  so you don't need to go find S Sub standard deviation of errors or residuals. You don't need to find sfx. It's all encoded in the computers down it for you.  are not convenient  Now there's just a printout from our or minitab or something. I can't even remember where I got this one.  But you should be comfortable diving into anyone's print out.  Because you're going to find everyone in the world can't agree on a piece of software. It's incredibly frustrating. My whole life is nothing more than learning everybody new software and that's what your life's going to feel like to sit. I feel like that.  I'm imagining the Cs people by now.  I've done some C C plus plus some Java some HTML and CSS some bootstrap. Maybe now you've done some are picked up a little python on the side and then there's all the other visual graphical things that are particular to whatever.  Angular iOS whatever write your life. Sorry.  What?  well  Premier gets exhausting I can't handle it but you probably more energy than I do.  You can probably I mean you want to go to computer programming software design.  Tell for you, maybe always feels amazing.  And I can never get tired.  But I'm just too exhausted in life to keep going with learning languages is just too much and I don't want to push that on anybody.  Maybe I just feel really sick right now and that's why I see how you do. Can you take  Talked in our sample and inch increase Maps over to 3.382 pounds 250 people that sampled computer told me how spread out things were.  for the sampling distribution  Can you build me a 95% CI?  That's what these problems feel. Like. I'm going to hand you all the pieces and then say do the last step of putting them together.  Okay about to lots of time hopefully used it.  I just wanted that you learn JavaScript maybe Haskell.  Play everything into the formula, right? There's just that one pesky thing of tea stars of 248. So either you went to your table, you looked up some it was close to 2:48, cuz I'm probably didn't have 248 and your table.  undergone  So this is our best guess of what an inch of human being ways.  Sorry American into American.  3.12 to 3.6 bar. So every time we make an American one inch taller, that's my best guess of how much we're going to increase things.  If you want to ride some weird statement, you can say we're 95% confident that  What comes after the. A parameter the talks about a whole population?  The weight of an inch of an American that feels like a big population.  What happens after that you say I hope it's in my interval. Maybe it is maybe it isn't I'll never know but my interval came from a interval generating process that makes good intervals 95% of the time.  Hope they are just a good one.  Now talking about software.  It wasn't just a random interlude cuz there's a slide look like test.  remember to being in the class when I was like you have to learn R and some people like no, I know python what happens during our  And maybe you're frustrated or maybe to know any of that and it's like, okay, I'll do whatever you say.  so  people always ask me like which is better.  r or python  I actually think that's not perhaps the best question to ask. It's right on the subtle question like better for whom better win.  Better to teach people on better to use in the world better for your job better from my job. If you look at it when people write Journal articles, what software do they use if they talk about any software you can see SPSS are SAS and then finally python park somewhere around here.  Tell her python so you want to be an academic?  Most people currently do not use Python compare to fight okay job different in R and python.  and how they've grown it didn't really matter for 5 years ago, but  Python is quickly becoming more popular in the business world. So  and in the end if you're good at life, you're going to learn both because you'll spend some time in Academia sometime in the real world.  fyf rating  Okay, I am more than a sec.  Okay. Now what you want to do besides build confidence intervals. You might want to run a hypothesis test.  The question first is like what would a hypothesis test about a slope even be?  7 most boring value for slope. I could think up would be zero.  The question is how would one ever get a slope of 0?  Well the typical way you get a slope of zero is if your data set looks like Pure Noise.  If I have to draw a line through this the only reasonable line to draw is a horizontal one. Cuz if you draw something with a slope to it, then the point should follow that idea and you're the points don't do anything, right?  And what a slope of zero effectively says is the ideas on the axes are independent of each other. They have no association. And the reason it's true is look here. If you know the x value is 65 the y-values go all the way up and down. It could be anything if you know, there's probably 75 the Y values go up and down.  There's like no predictive value that X generates and helping you figure out why why is always just a big hot mess everywhere?  now so for example, let's say you put  Height on the x-axis and wait on the y-axis. Obviously the. Should Trend upward right, but if you put height on the x-axis, can you put GPA?  on the y-axis  Is there a trend upward downward?  sample America  Why does it go up in America?  obviously  How about this one?  height  salary  Well, I social justice people in the room.  how to color people do make more money even after you  so the jobs that have lots of money in life. Some of them have height restrictions.  basketball basketball pro basketball player  Okay, so and so that's one thing like the structural nature of our society and what a currently values tens and some cases to promote certain Heights.  There could also be social justice things were maybe we're conditioned to like people that are taller. I don't know. I don't know if GPA and height have relationship. I do know that height and salary do cuz I just read about it in a book 3 weeks ago. So I know how these things are complicated if that's Oprah zero if it goes up or down I don't care.  That'll be interesting. Right and I don't even care how steep it is.  If it's just a little slope that might make a big difference.  Depends what things are on the axes, right and what the units are and all this stuff. So anyhow, if we're going to test a hypothesis here, then we're going to do what we normally do take the best. Guess you got for the slope based on your sample. That's estimate hear some type of would be really born on a slope is 0 and / has spread out slopes going to be in life.  That does your number called a t statistic and you take that number and you drop it down on a curve here. I'm writing to 7-2 to remind you that it's the T distribution within -2 degrees of freedom is where we going to drop this and start shading some things here with numbers. Here's it's finding the T statistic.  If you got a slope on the height idea of 3.382.  And it will also tell you the p-value right next to it. Okay, so apparently the number 3.38 to 8 0.  And it's so far from zero. It's 25 standard deviations above what you would expect to get for a slope if you really supposed to be getting this load near zero.  So here you would throw out the null and move to the alternative.  And this software is designed. You can see like know where did I mention the alternative is to cited the soccer usually has that as a default. So probably you people don't want to do one side of tests in life. You just need to cut the P value in half. So I'm so shaking both ways and being excited about both ends. You're just excited about one of them so you can pull out what you need.  Now, let me see your nice example.  From an actual study where this gets used.  Does the attractiveness of a professor affect his or her teaching evaluations?  To find out they went to ratemyprofessor.com.  Maybe if you ask that, you can select how good you thought they were and their those Chili Peppers.  Where you can decide how hot you think they are?  Now this isn't just some crazy thing.  So first of all, I think the concept of beauty is incredibly complicated incredibly subjective. There's so many different definitions.  But everyone brings their own definition when they select those Chili Peppers, okay. So this sort of the average across all human definition  So I don't have any personal like definition for the stuff but that even means the average across all human beings what they think who actually go to ratemyprofessor.com.  Okay. Now why would you ever care about something like that? She might say this totally frivolous.  If there were a really strong relationship between these ideas you might be a little concerned if you're an administrator, for example, and you make a tenure decision case based on teaching evaluations.  You are just sort of pulling out how hot the person is according to the average metric.  I maybe even care about social justice things. You would want to be aware of such a thing. So if there are ways to fix it, you could go then trying to employ those if there is no relationship, then you're not worried. And this is just another variable that has nothing to do with attractiveness.  So, what do you think?  I'd like people to argue both ways.  You don't have to believe what you're arguing. It just has to be reasonable logic.  Why do hotter teachers have higher scores and why do how do teachers have lower scores?  Which would you like to do?  Okay. Give me the give me the logic.  Attractive that their traits are now equally attractive or at least attractive. So therefore when you have someone's tracking  Okay, so if someone is good on one category, you might suspect they're good on all the others and then you get duped.  You know if they're like really smart you get attracted to that and then your attraction number goes up. Okay, I can believe that to you want to argue the other way.  Is a parallel with liability?  Attractiveness is correlated to likability.  and if you like someone  you get to route.  Love it, Sorry the other way. Good luck.  Okay, so people get their jobs in life, whether they're hot based on whether they're hot or not not based on qualifications.  So  Okay, what did you want to add?  Good for you to write that so oh my goodness. This is so weird.  Turn off the side of a teacher's good based on how well they are doing the students and if the professor too hot they get distracted and they don't learn stuff.  Okay seems plausible. Right? I don't know if it's true or not. I don't know if you believe it or not all the things you said could be true. Right the question of course is like a trooper seconds.  How does a way that's what really matters maybe it's just a tiny bit true.  I don't know but  Now that you've already both sides. Hopefully you agree with me that we can write a two-sided alternative.  It was some reasonable logic that could excite us now. I don't know what you end up thinking in life. How you weigh it all out in your soul. I don't even know. So here's a no and neither with the nose will always be like for this the ideas on the accies beauty and teaching evaluation score have no association another way of saying they're independent. You can choose either phrase.  But it's really helpful to note that you're really trying to say that the slope of the regression movie Zero.  So that's how we're actually going to study this by putting things quantitative variables on axios and building a regression equation. You know, there was some Association. I don't know if it's positive negative big or small. I don't care.  So I know you're not something they did hear they took the average teaching evaluation and I left it on the original point system 1 through 5. They took the attractiveness Chili Peppers and they standardized so that the average attractiveness whatever. That means was given a 0.  I feel see why it's helpful in a second now.  Should we run this study?  Do we meet the conditions necessary for building regression lines and doing inference talk me through the four things and if you think they happen or not.  Okay, go ahead.  residual plot or histogram  Are you looking at that? Okay, I guess that's kind of normal. I'll give it to you what next?  Yeah.  Marshall fact SRS 463  call Rochelle many of us dime a dozen.  Santa's not real  Concentrate abilities are the kind of worried about that are open this picture or that one.  Bottom right? You know what you're saying?  A QQ plot your brother don't know what that is. Don't look at it.  Ebenezer 1  I like imagine like  is it changing to you?  I don't know something something so hard to say what's up. What's up? What's condition?  It's the worst one on this.  So does the plot look linear?  What's that quantile quantile plot?  If isomers of the normality of something that's trying to measure the normality of this cookie right here.  So these dots represent what's going on with the normality of this and some complicated way and if it truly is normal to. Should fall perfectly on the line.  Call you might be a little worried about normally toward the end. That's what's going on.  But I let him have it.  You're okay with me letting her have this normal now. What about your straight enough?  I look like I'm not annoyed, huh? Okay, so if you're studying something and it really doesn't have a strong Trenton to it.  It's going to start looking like noise.  So you can still put a line through it the line just might have slope 0.  So this is a tricky case where it clearly does not look very near to me. And the reason it doesn't look linear is cuz it's noisy and everything is noisy cuz there's something very weak going on here. But you can still build in your things for weak situations. You just don't feel very good about doing it.  All the things we just said let's get back.  There's a print out but computer screen broke.  now  this is the box for care about right.  That's telling you the slope and the slope is telling you how changes in attractiveness.  Are changes in teaching score?  How can we calculate that box using the others in the table?  Set the one number that we all want to know in the room.  What do you say?  I'm just very tired and you never was nope.  You're trying to do some calculation like SE / s x x squared + -1.  Maybe that's what you're trying to do that for me to find standard error of the B-1 terms, which is already displayed on the screen is playing 30322.  What do you say?  How'd you get 4.13 * 0322?  Okay good.  too far  There you go. That's what you just said. Right that 4.1 trees the t-stat the way you find it. If I'm doing estimate -0 / point or the standard error .03 to to hear to all these numbers play together in Sanborn understand. That's when you really care about in the table is like how does everything relate that shows that you really know what's going on?  Okay, so you said in the end? I can just multiply 4.13 * 2.03 to 2?  So we get the result Point 133 notice that's positive.  So what does that mean?  correlation  There is a correlation. There's a correlation between two ID any any two ideas on Earth.  Weather at small or big is a different question.  Precisely, what is that relationship?  Let's not use the word correlation. Okay at all correlation is of this value called are it's a numerical thing that you can go study.  So-net O'Quinn if you ever say the word correlations the rest of your life, you should be thinking about a particular number based on a certain statistic that between -1 and 1 blah blah blah use the word association. If you're trying to tell me these things are related to one another.  Okay, so precisely how are they related? How do I interpret the number? 1 3 3  Forever 21 cute to be okay. So everyone unit increase on the x-axis, there's a point 133 increase on the y-axis. Now the x-axis is beauty scores and they've standardized them. So moving one unit is like moving one standard deviation.  So for every standard deviation you make someone prettier.  Whatever that means 13 scores will go up 133 on this zero through five teaching scale.  That's precisely what's going on here.  On average based on this model Bubba block now. Is that number so different from zero?  Can you like to conclude there actually is an association.  You think it's pretty small?  If it got small.  How would we decide we'd run a hypothesis test, right?  And the hypothesis will test will say are you zero, or are you so far from zero that you can possibly be zero and I need to believe something else in life.  Okay. So here's a regression equation. We just talking about that 4.01 + the slope.  The 4.0 one means what?  What was saying people? How about someone new?  It's hopeless. Go ahead.  Okay, if your beauty score 0 which here means?  The ugliest. No, it doesn't it's precisely what it doesn't mean.  Didn't we standardize the beauty score is so is your Amanda average? Are you want to go back and see?  Standardized attractiveness score zero average negative below average selling. Okay. So so that's what this mean if your average attractiveness. You're already going to get a 4. Hey, that's pretty good, right?  R5 yeah.  Okay. So what conclusion should we draw from the hypothesis test? That's what we've been doing all along. We start out by saying there's no association the slope should be zero it be super cool if there were slow at 10. We got Point 133 you were like, hey that feels pretty small to me that basically feels like zero but  Is it?  Go ahead.  We should reject the null the P value as you can see on the screen in the table is basically zero.  So we should reject it there does appear to be some sort of Association going on between these variables and this data is suggesting is positive maybe a different dataset would have suggested negative. So all we can suggest. Is there some Association going on.  And the dead are pointing us to a new study. We might want to go do that shows being hot or get you better scores, but that would be a new study. Okay, so he value zero. You can't just look at the numbers 8.133 feel small. Okay statistics. What is trying to do is decide if it's statistically different than zero.  Okay, that's a statistical significance idea. What you were saying to me was more of a practical significance. Does it really matter?  Like how small does it have to be before you don't care suppose moving one standard deviation of hotness raise their teaching scores who units so the slope or two.  Okay, you're probably bothered.  It seems like a lot to move just based on the tractor, Miss. Okay. So this is only moving point 133. Is that enough for you? Practically to be like? Oh, we have to throw out everything we're doing in life. We can't use teaching scores to help decide how good professors are.  That's a practical kind of question and it depends on your soul and what you need out of things and how precise they have to be.  Okay. So for some people like if there's even a tiny bit here the social justice about it will bother them for other people that doesn't meet the threshold of where they say. We need to really start worrying about this. That's a personal thing. I don't have the right answer. I can just tell you statistically that number basically ain't zero.  Even though it's really close.  Okay, let's go to Yellowstone.  I want to go back. Have you been to Yellowstone?  So we are busy trying to predict how long you have to sit there and wait based on how long the eruptions last in that you just saw.  Okay, and we use 207 observations. So let's see if we can create a 90% confidence intervals for how each minute of eruptive time Maps over the waiting time. Let's get a good sense of how long you have to wait. Okay. So here's the table the printout will have everything we need pretty much.  We build some confidence intervals already, right? So what's going to be new here? The formula is the same as we're doing before?  We just have to figure out that pesky p star, don't we?  Now you can use technology to do it or you can go look in a table. I wanted to show you some of the pain that comes when you use a table.  Okay. Now we want to make a 90% CI so that all all we care about is figuring this out right here and the other numbers were pulled from the print out. So we need to go to roll 105. Here's an example of some table. I pulled off the internet so you could see different kinds of tables that exist out there.  Okay, so they go and go and go and then they start making Leaps and Bounds after a while. The reason I do that except the numbers aren't really changing anymore. If you go from 1 to 100 and 101, nothing changes, you can see if you go from 100 to 150. Not much changes. Okay, some things in the hundredths place on these last ones.  So anyway 105 okay, just go to one of the roads near it. I don't even care.  Find that row we wanted a 90% confidence interval. So there's 10% left in these Tales here. So the intersection is this 1.66. So there's our interval. So every minute of eruptive time is about 9.7 to 11.7 waiting minutes. That's a really good representation of what happens Beyond this dataset to all possible eruptions ever.  Okay. I'll see you on Friday.  You can. "
