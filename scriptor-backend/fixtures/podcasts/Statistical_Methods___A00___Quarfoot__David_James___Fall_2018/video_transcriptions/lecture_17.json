    "Full Transcript": "Welcome back.  as you can see from the calendar we're going to do a little reviewing today, and then Wednesday will be  Your chance to shine on exam 2 and then we'll head up a little before your beautiful three day weekend.  It exam is going to cover everything that's been going on since the last exam.  I've listed that has chapters 3 and 4 in the little exam info document, but I wanted to remind you that in the middle of chapter 3 we went and did some extra stuff in the supplement about density functions continuous random variables. That's all part of what's on this exam and you'll see that reflected in all the old exams will have stuff about that also.  Okay now the slides for today.  probably weren't up where they  yeah, that's cuz I wanted to see what people could do when you didn't have all the answers in front of you.  So first of all, a lot of people have trouble choosing which probability model to use and you now know many of these about 7 to be precise.  So what you should do first when you're trying to figure out what to do.  You should decide whether the idea is being talked about is a discreet idea that has spaces between it.  In which case you wanted to play one of these top four models or whether the idea could take on basically any value in some nice span?  And then you're talking about a continuous random variable. This is the most important stuff you can do immediately because it cuts out half the models and it keeps you focused on what am I actually trying to measure and study here?  And that's the most important thing to think about.  So if you ask that high-level question, you'll get yourself into the right macro category. And then once you're in that category, then you have to break out more specific micro knowledge about how you knew it was this discrete model VS. Discrete model.  We're going to try this in Socrative.  There will not be any answers listed there because we're going to call him people and you're going to tell me how you knew what to choose what the words were that connected with your soul.  I'm glad you in the right direction.  Hopefully Socrative will not break today.  Which model best summarizes the blow idea the amount of time before the next volcanic eruption on Earth.  Pro tips get yourself into the correct macro category first of discrete versus continuous.  Half the room is not in the right macro category as you see someone who got this right tell me how you deconstructed this.  Go ahead.  Time is continuous.  Unless of course we round.  But there's no indication, right? Okay. So then what's an hour in the continuous? How did you choose exponential?  Keep going.  Sounded like the washers you mapped it to a similar washer dryer dishwasher problem.  Hey someone else who sell certain words that make them feel a certain way.  Go ahead.  Generally when it says amount of time it tends to be exponential. That's actually true.  Unless of course, I'm going to play on that thing in your soul.  You'll see that in a moment.  You're waiting for something to occur. Right? It's the amount of time until an event occurs that exponential.  That's what the definition of it. Okay, half the room lights to round time a continuous idea to a discrete idea.  The number of emails I get today.  I don't know what size comes up so slowly.  Okay, what percentage of the room is still a continuous 13% of the 15% of the rhombus insisted continuous. You think I can get one and a half emails?  Someone got this tell me how you approached and thought about this. What were the words what happened in your soul?  Go ahead.  I agree. The number of emails is just read half. The models are gone. Now. What?  a real meal  Okay, so there is some great hidden here right? How many miles I get per day? I didn't say it, right?  And I made you feel like this on.  Okay, if it were going to feel binomial, first of all, there has to be some value of n it's fixed that we can't go beyond.  What do you think that is?  Trust me. I've got 932 emails in today. So at this number can be big so I know this make any sense. There has to be like an upper bound.  Please don't send me an email.  The whole number of days we must wait until a politician next tells a lie.  Can I someone talk to me about geometric and why negative binomial doesn't make sense to you?  Go ahead.  number of Trials until first success  How many days trial teller I thought time was continuous?  All I said whole number of days.  What do you think about all the negative binomial people in the room?  Are they wrong?  No.  So negative binomial is you want to get our successes and you want to know how many takes and they're setting are equal to one when are is one negative binomial the same as geometric? So these are both technically correct other one is a bit.  Heavy on its sophistication when it didn't need to be still correct, though.  The number of times and Archer hit the target when shooting a creeper with 10 arrows.  What are the possible values that this random variable can take on?  No, those are the possible values be Bernoulli trial of a single arrow for take on hit or miss this is about a quiver full. What are the possible values?  cr210 integers  Once you decide that I instantly know the answer all the other discreet models go off to Infinity for possibilities by binomials. The only one that has a finite on the possibilities that also is the appropriate logical thing here next.  The moment during the day that a meteor enters Earth's atmosphere.  Counting up very slowly.  Oh my goodness.  Someone talk to me about what you were thinking who got it, right?  Go ahead.  First of all, it's continuous why the moment of the day is kind of like time which is kind of like continuous got it. I agree now, it's continuous. Look at all those discreet people.  Okay. Now what?  Are you rounding to the nearest second that sounds discrete look at all those continuous people?  Nanos that you rounding to the nearest nanosecond best discreet  moment moment.  You feel like every moment is equally like it is every other moment.  I don't think the media or is going to care if it's day or night is right.  The instant any instant is just as likely as any other instant. The meteor doesn't have a watch on and show up at some time just shows up when it does write some random nonsense.  I'm just going to pick on little things people say that are false the number of chocolates. You must be removed from a huge box of chocolates. If you want to discover for with fruit filling you love fruit fillings, and you just got to keep eating until you get your precious four.  Thank you. By the way for first focusing on discrete vs. Continuous. Hopefully the rest of the room will take your lead on that.  I assume this one's going to go quite well.  Okay, all you binomial people?  There has to be some upper bound on the number of chocolates that must be removed for you to say by no meal.  It could take a trillion chocolates to find those for it's a big huge box huge.  It's a Costco box that has Infinity chocolates in it.  Oh my goodness, okay.  Famous people choosing normal the uniform people there must be a lower bound and upper bound on your world. What's the longest nose possible?  Haven't you seen Cyrano de Bergerac?  Exponential people small noses should be more likely than big nose is everyone should be near zero.  Okay, most biological traits are normally distributed. The number of typos a student makes on a term paper.  Okay, someone talk to me about your thinking.  Go ahead.  Typos or discrete can't make one and a half next.  There's probably some raid going on even though it's not specified and it feels poisson. How do you know it can't be binomial?  You can have Infinity typos, right or work your way up to that binomial has an upper bound on what's possible?  Geometric, we're not waiting for the first typo to appear.  The number of people the TSA my screen before finding someone who forgot to dispose of a water bottle.  When you're standing in line at the San Diego Airport heading home for Thanksgiving.  You can think of this problem and every time you stand at TSA for the rest of your life.  There's two thirds of the room.  Someone tell me how you got to geometric and how you feel about negative binomial.  Go ahead.  How do I know if it's discrete versus continuous?  People there no fractional amount of people.  So then you're waiting for the first of something sounds geometric to me.  How do you feel about negative binomial?  It's possible if you just let rb1 it generates into the geometric. So they the same answer.  These are all the counterculture people maybe.  The average IQ of the three contestants each day that show up on the game show Jeopardy.  getting harder  Someone talk me through normality.  Go ahead.  How do we know what you're talking about?  When I take an average of three IQs, I would never around that.  When I take an average of genders and I sign people zeros and ones and I get about five 1.  51% of people are female. I'm not going to round that guy. So you should not assume rounding happenings is happening with someone forcibly says that things are going to be rounded like the whole number of days and that are there a problem.  Go ahead.  averages are continuous  It's basically true.  temperature averaging together draft venting together whole numbers for example  and you're doing three of them. The only possibilities are like zero 1/3 2/3 one one in the third one and two thirds, but you're basically right averages are basically continue. Okay, so it's in the bottom half. Now what?  There's no upper bound. So uniform is out. What about exponential?  The probability of a low IQ is not higher. I agree. So only left with normal now know the best answer here.  What is the best answer key or something best answer in the universe for example normal allows four- averages?  Are there any negative IQs?  So sometimes you have to wave your hand a little someone else talk to me about why you really think it's normal. Go ahead.  now is this  IQs  yes or notices to well said  Waukee timer IQ  add-on  aren't sampling distributions always normally distributed and didn't I just take a sample? Okay. So together you have two nice pieces. You are basically saying when you do nice things to normal distributions, you get a normal distribution that was on one of the Hallmarks write the sum of normals is normal while the average is also normal. Okay. You also gave reference to some Central limit theorem blah blah blah fanciness from the other is a sampling distribution the average of 3 people could you doing so that is also normal now. Always normal, it's going to get more complicated, but it still normal for you.  I noticed something here. A lot of these 2% correct was like 60 to 80%  This is just the first step in a problem. Then might have lots of steps, right if you can't pick the right model everything stops. So that's why you want to make sure you get this right? I'm definitely going to take that and all the easy ones are going away.  Sorry next time.  Ready for more time for you to work on things.  Here we go. Let's just put some problems up and see how you do.  the median of a continuous random variable  It's a fine to be the place on the x-axis which all called tea or half the areas to the right and half the area is to the left.  Find the median of the exponential distribution.  Good luck.  After room seems good and half the room seems what is going on. What's an exponential distribution?  Okay, here's a picture of one.  I'm telling you. I want to know the place on the horizontal axis here for half the area to the left and half to the right. So that's what we want to find so you could set up this and I'll go right here. I want to go from 0 to the your place. This density curve is Lambda * e to the negative Lambda X.  I didn't tell you what land is it's just going to show up throughout the whole problem and be in your answer.  Make sure you don't have.  This x here and I can also put an X up there.  You don't have to be different letters. Okay, then some problem happens.  As some of you probably went from T to Infinity, that's fine. Also, you just had to do a harder problem.  Let's see if it's half that way. It's at the other way and 0 to T is a nice finite bound. Don't do the improper integral unless you have to yeah.  If you make that around Infinity do I expect you to always use the limit process? Absolutely 100% - 1/2 guaranteed if you don't  I can't be any clearer this problem had a way to subvert that.  Just tastefulness that I know you'd like to avoid any how go find the lower bound and then just go sell some problem. You need to take the natural log.  I actually took the reciprocal of both sides.  I noticed it would make the negative exponent positive and the horrible decimal it would turn into the nice integer to wasn't that sweet of me.  If you have negative natural log of .5 over land on your page, it's equivalent to that.  The negative sign can go up.  Into the natural log and turn your 1/2 into a dose.  How that go.  Okay, try this, you know that 68% of the normal distribution lives within one standard deviation of the mean of the normal distribution.  What percent of a uniform distribution?  Lies within one standard deviation of the mean of the uniform distribution.  Was it a lot easier once I put the picture up?  All I have to do is draw a picture of situations that makes a dramatic.  Dramatic improvement over things you need to find the area of this weird box. Right? Will the standard deviation helps you figure out how wide it is and the density function. Hope to figure out how tall it is.  okay, so it's two standard deviations wide so that's why I did b - 8 / root 12 * 2  and the density function is going to be one over B- a  best to make sure that the area is 1  turns out it doesn't matter where it's entered or any of that nonsense.  So you get one over the square root of 2 or if you like to go over Route 12 or if you like.  .577  So the uniform distribution does not have as much of its area crammed into that first standard deviation. Each way. It has a lot out at the ends where the normal Peters off and stops having lots of area.  Picture is worth so many words.  Okay next.  We make it harder egg weights normally distributed mean of 2 oz standard deviation of 2.2. Oz a carton of eggs has 12 that's known as a dozen.  Your goal is to find a carton with a total weight above 25 oz.  How many carbs should you expect to go through before finding one? That is heavy enough?  List any assumptions you had to make along the journey.  In order to actually solve the problem.  Difficulty just went up.  What you need here is the distribution of the carton weights all 12 eggs combined. That's why I made C4 cartoon is just the sum of a bunch of eggs. I didn't even see here cuz that stands for expected value and I didn't want to reuse that so he's W-4 weight. Now there's two ways to get to it. This distribution is 1 is due to Central limit theorem and they say, okay. Well, let's let's first focus on the average weight of an egg and are Carton and come over here and get this formula. This is a sigma / \u221a end.  And then you can multiply both sides by 12 if you know what you're doing. Okay, so that's one way the other way. I start tons of people doing is if you know that the sum of normals is normal. You need the central limit theorem nonsense. You can just say I know that she is going to be normal and then you just go figure out its expected value.  Okay, it's just a bunch of expected values that add together and a bunch of variances or standard deviations or whatever. So there's there's different ways to get here, but hopefully you got this expression for the cartons weight.  Senator 24 while there's 12 eggs in there about 2 each and I'll think I point 6928 or some equivalent there of okay. So have you when I get there is fine.  Now what well, we would love to find one. That's more than 25. So what's the probability of doing that Rob is distribution, which is about the cartoon weights find 25 on it and then go do so if you want to use a table go calculate the z-score 1.44.  And then go look up the P value you get .925 one. That's the area to the left of 25 subtract that from 1 to get the area to the right. So you should get .07 for 9. That's a probability of getting a carton above 25.  Now what the problem wants it want you to keep looking through them over and over at the store?  Until you find one.  So I set up a random variable.  Which is how many we're going to have to look through that's a discreet idea number of cartons to find one that is heavy enough. That's a first occurrence of something. And so this is a geometric random variable. So it's expected value is one of her P 13.35 tell me what you're bothered by.  Yes, the final page of the midterm will be a table.  And everyone the first thing you'll do is rip it off.  So if you don't have a fancy calculator, you don't need one. I make the answer key with the table.  If you're going to use your calculator at some point you have some way of getting 2.0 for 9. You should write on the page what you typed into the calculator.  And then it'll spread out the answer and just tell me that.  As long as we know what's going on.  Anything else you're wondering about?  Go ahead.  Okay. So let's see here / 12 equals 6 normal distributions * 12  The question is how does one do this? Well, expected values, you know this formula that if you multiply something by 12 in an expected value, you can just move the 12 out front and X the expected value at time getting this 2 * 12 gives 24.  Well, it's on the next slide. You also know the standard deviation of a constant a * 2 thing is just a * 2 standard deviation.  So the standard deviation of what's currently going on is 2 / Route 12, and I multiply mat by 12. So the Route 12 in the bottom cancels with the 12 in the top.  And that's how I get that Route 12 right there.  But this is you don't need them Central limit theorem is way too much machinery.  to invoke air  now in order to do all this you need to assume the eggs are independent. They're making up the carton.  Which may or not be the true, right?  And then I have to assume the curtains flowing at you at the store or independent also, so there was a lot of Independence.  There's a couple more problems if you want to keep working. Otherwise, I'll see you Wednesday. "
