    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started on Wednesday. We talked about this new idea of predicates that let us extend the kind of logical statements. We could make two values from interesting domains other than true true and false. So we looked at some predicate silver numbers and all of them. We defined with these fixed-length tables. So the examples we saw four colors and for Abby's to compliment representations all had fixed size tables or a fixed number of elements in the domain and today. I want to explore predicate swear. That's not the case because there's lots of time where will have a number of elements that we can't just write down in a fix size table will get a bunch of practice with the quantifiers doing this because most of the interesting things we want to say about credit GIF often involves existential and Universal statements for used for all in exist. Two applications of using these kinds of products. I do want to take a minute to do a different kind of quick announcement just to highlight two two specific thing in general. I want to remind everybody that you do have to type your homework week. It's a we deduct if you hand write your homework and take a picture and hand it in and in the second homework, there's a problem that I asked you to draw some to design a logic circuit and we want you to have a picture that is generated digitally not hand drawn and taking a picture up. This is actually think this is an important point for the course most scientific communication happens through typeset work and work. So it's useful for you to just like develop the skills to Bilby things up is types that document so there's some nice logic gate images on Wikipedia. Navigate to Anza lures XRS, and they're all free they're all Creative Commons license. So you can copy paste them and use them. However, you want another, I want to make his wee-wee put out the aazah post after we finish grading assignments and give information about common mistakes and about things that we want you to be paying attention to in general because going forward a lot of how we grade things that you need to know so that you don't miss format things or do things in ways were asking you to not do them. And I want to make a point that we released solutions for all the assignments and the solutions are not the solutions are kind of writing. So we don't we really do not want answers in this class. Obviously, we don't want answers that are like just a number with no calculations or justification, but I also don't want it at all. If there's no English in an answer and there's just a sequence of mathematical statements, I as the reader have no idea what the claim being made it is or what the conclusion of that argument is. It's not an argument is actually just maybe five mathematical facts in a row. So if you skill that we want you to develop in this class is a skill of communication and communication is more than writing a sequence of correct mathematical statement that is not communication. It's only part of an accurate communication about a problem that we say things like using the definition of Home Marion binary expansion calling out that if you were to look at this calculation that's happening in part. You should refer to a particular definition for that to make sense. If we just run out this calculation who-knows-what definition. We're referring to use of one of the other definition. So we're always careful in our solutions to be specific. Phoenicians were using before introducing any calculations with you. If you're doing any kind of scientific writing or any kind of communication in like with your team, you can't just send the math or some contacts about why you did that math or why you produce that code. So this is what we're looking for justification the tizen calculations you do back to the problem statement under the definition you use So with that I want to get started for for the day just as a reminder the second home works out and is due Monday night. But then again there will be the next warm up in a follow-up to next Thursday. But the thing you should be focusing on right now is the homework due on Monday night. We Define predicate on Wednesday as functions that take an element from a given domain and map it to or produce the value. That's true or false or true or false producing functions. And on Wednesday. We Define the mall using these fix size tables, but there are many predicate that are interesting that work over. I saw in this table. I wrote it as a table, but I thought... And I want to be clear that there's no last row in this table. This table keeps going. We could always talk about having another number or another a bit string or another sequence of ones and zeros. The keeps getting longer and represents may be the next number in sequence so we can imagine this table never ends. There's no last row to this table. We can keep producing an extra row.  And so I have much like we had on Wednesday written in each of the predicate that were interpreting these in their base 2 expansion not a fixed with space expansion just their base 2 expansion in Ensign definition of the first first question. I want to ask her first thing. I want to fill in and talk about here is what how should we describe? What is the predicate talk about this? How can we describe it? What's the domain of these predicate? What should we say if I asked you to write down the domain?  What are some spots some thoughts on how to write down the domain of these predicate? How would I describe the domain? I'm going to try and write it down.  domain of these products  all positive integers. So one idea these are all some ideas we could have so when idea is positive integers.  Other ideas other ideas, there's many many times in the spices many representations we could use for something and some of them are useful in different ways other ways. We can talk about the domain of these products.  unsigned base 2  all the unsigned ways to representations.  I wish we could describe it.  So interesting, so you're giving some giving like a either maybe a what you what you said had two comparisons in it. And then Anne and some kind of logical expression. Maybe we could use to talk about this and maybe there's a way to talk about the positive integers in a different way by saying it's all that X is greater than or equal to one or something like that. Is this a maybe this is an approach to talking about it. What are other ways we could write down? What are other ways we can talk about the domain of this predicate of the ways we can talk about the domain.  I'm going to extend what you said a little bit maybe we'd want to use the set builder notation and talk about X such that X is greater than or equal to one. Maybe that would be interesting this whole top row talking about positive integers is a little bit. It's a little bit interesting to think about this top row because the exes we have in this table. It's depending on how we want to interpret this table in this problem. It's not clear to me that those are positive that those are supposed to be positive integers careful to say that they were interpreting. This is base to expand interpreting the x 2 expansion.  Or we could just say that it's some sequins P1 bien.  Where in is a positive integer?  and each  bi is 1 of 0.  And one night he let me get rid of these parentheses who typically haven't written parentheses around are sequences in this class.  Maybe it's just a sequence of coefficients beach one is 0 and 1 and it's some sequence of them.  That's interesting with that with that are there any missing like if I took that set of all of these be ones to be ends where the the bees are 01. Are there any there any in that specification of the domain that aren't showing up here?  Not description that don't show up in the table you have. Yeah.  Doing our best to representation. We are forcing the first it's always the one I don't free samples because of the Euro or zero one in this table on restriction. We need more restrictions if we were really talking about this domain that's only the base 2 expansions, right and really what I've written down in the table the thing it's a sort of most most accurate would be the right out the definition of base 2 expansion say it's all over but it's worth being precise about this because maybe I would have written something here with 0 + 0 1 and then maybe that we have to talk about what it would mean for the predicate to be true or false widows in Romaine here is just the number of the sequences with base 2 expansions.  And that's a set that does not fit in some pics. I disable this table keeps going on. But those are all important considerations for sort of figuring out exactly what these products are talking. So the domain is we're taking the domain here as the the bit strings of the sequences of 0 and 1/2 expansion definition.  Looking at these three predicates. El&m. How can we write them symbolically? Like how can we write them out in this gets have something something people are saying about greater than and less than signs and things like that. But if we wanted to write out predicates symbolically for E L & M sport question in this setting then it was on Wednesday because on Wednesday, we could always just draw the whole table and talk about talk about all of the volume. But here we need some representation that symbolic nautical really need to be able to sort of calculate this calculate this for any input because we don't have the entire table available. So it's going to become more and more important for medical or symbolic representations of these predicate. So, how can I write these down symbolically a little bit thinking about how we could write down these representations symbolically as an expression.  These acts equal some expression or maybe you have some other way of of writing it down.  Okay, so I want to talk through a few of these and there's a few different ways we can think about trying to trying to write these down so I could write e f x equals something and have something on the right hand side. There's something like that and I'm something  Something else that doesn't look like this.  Okay, so the books to write something down or something like that suggestion. What can I put on the right hand side here then what can I put on the right hand side?  X mod 2 equals 0  so we had this operation and we talked about early on and maybe we say xmod to is equal to zero. I'm just going to put parentheses to be really careful about where the where the expressions are you interesting.  One thing that I find interesting about reading it this way. We're going to be there in  Interesting. So I really like this idea of unpacking bits are unpacking the coefficients and I'm looking at something like the last coefficient under the least significant coefficients. What's the another idea would be the same? Well, there's some structure.  There's some structure to act right? There's some coefficients in their exes a sequin. And so if we want to talk about these these sequences generally well, maybe what this is is a sequence of fits under some property of the bits that tells us whether something is even and maybe one way to write this down to say that the least significant bit is equal to 0.  A significant bit is equal to 0.  I want to poke at this top definition for a minute, which is I want to highlight this part here using x-gear. Now if x is defined as like an actual bit string or sequence of coefficients here. We might want to be more precise than just saying xmod to we thought it might be reasonable to talk about this instead being something like doing out the expansion. I doing out the arithmetic for the expansion. So really this would be like to be 1 * 2 to the exponent + b 2 * 2 to the exponent not writing this out in all of it in of a base expansion.  Mod 2 is equal to 0.  Because if x is really a sick this sequence of coefficients of our domain is just these bit string we need to say something about how to get from these bit strings to a number that we're going to do arithmetic with we didn't say x is the number we didn't pick X's positive numbers. We said X's V's Pitt Springs so we get from there to a number that we're going to do arithmetic with we probably want to use the definition of expansion.  So I'd be hesitant to say this. First one is a precise enough definition. I would want to see a definition that uses uses respitech one other thing. It was mentioned as maybe we could write something using the set builder notation. So something like  equals  and something in here where maybe be an equal 0 and I'm being a little bit deliberately imprecise. This is not something we should write when writing a predicate. The definition of a predicate is that it takes an input and produces a true or false value in the right hand side. There is an entire set input and produce either true or false. It should not produce an entire set of values of the value for a particular input.  Ideas for those are some ideas for writing down with the Highlight that if we're talking about bit strings we want to do is go out the calculation before arithmetic and the idea that we saw before maybe the least significant 15-0 can tell us something about even this just I just say what I want to just ask. What about L&M what kinds of things might you write for L&M given this discussion what kinds of things might be right for L&M given all this discussion about for L&M.  All right suggestions for L&M and they don't have to be I don't need to hear entire Expressions. I want to hear some of high-level ideas for L&M. What kinds of things would you write for L&M?  things that you write for L&M  I'm just think so Pharrell you're saying there's only a few cases that can make this true. And so maybe for a levesque's a perfectly good definition is it's going to be basically the expansion of acts right. So maybe the doing out the arithmetic 4X you mean equals the sequence?  1 or x equals the sequence 107 interpretation is less than 3 so maybe we could just do that.  Yeah, go for a friend.  interesting  So you're saying look at the structure of this thing, and we know that we said the number is greater than 256 which is 2 to the 8th. And so that must mean that we needed 9 bits to represent it. I think we have to be slightly more clever than that. I think if it was to 55 like it was one below power of to that idea what actually work exactly what I think I think I just want to make sure it's something maybe folks out there can double double check me here to make sure that I'm getting this right but I think this is 257 and so it's something we can build with that idea now. I wish I'd made it safe to 55 cuz I would be a cool answer numbers between 2:55 and 5:11.  So what else what else that's actually really cool idea, but just for this constant doesn't quite work. What else what else?  Right. So be a 1 * 2 to the end. Actually. I'm going to write this one out our base expansions just to be just to be clear. Right we have written these out typically is K - 1 down to a zero. Sanitation was usually use for a basic pension. And that would be a Decay - 1 * 2 to the K - 1 + do this expansion all the way out.  When you're saying that has to be greater than 256 of her do the calculation.  Multiple ways we can write these out. We also could have written by doing the base expansion and asking if it's less than three, that would be a totally reasonable way to write out the predicate L as well. There was just this observation that there's only a couple values couple values that work and it would be interesting. I'm not going to have this discussion right now that multiple ways of writing that would be an interesting discussion to have an interesting thing to start demonstrating right that is exactly three given the representation. These are all conversations. We can have and strategies next week. We will be talking about proving some of these things need to be symbolic representations to talk about these predicate domains and there's lots of ways to write them down symbolically.  So let's get a little practice working with some existential in Universal properties over these predicate over LMA and can eat and then we'll do the demo actually get some more practice doing the same thing over.  over some DNA strands  So here's the first question. I want to ask what's a witness for this predicate?  Or I'm sorry for this existential over a predicate that there exists an act such that LFX implies. Anavex. So is the one that's four less than three times the 1/4 greater than 256.  Thanks for the first round 5 4 3 2 1.  Okay, let's begin again with the results of chatting with this for a second.  5 4 3 2 1  so for this kind of question, if you're asking if these specific values are witnesses or not. This means basically plug in the value and because we're asking if one is a witness for the if 100 is a witness for it and so on. So I just kind of question in for looking for Witnesses often times. What we can do is try some values and check them. So for the bit string of Acts is true that's definitely is representation is definitely less than  Lesson 3 and Emma's ex is definitely false because its representation is not greater than 256. And so the question is what's the results of the implication between these two things? Well, if we look up the truth table for implication if the part before the arrow is true, the part after is false that produces a false. That's actually the one that produces a false for for implication. The hypothesis is true. And the conclusion is false about the false prince location. So this can't be a witness because it produced false for witness were looking for an element of the domain that produces true for the start of the body of the existential of the expression in the existential.  4100  that is not it certifications not less than 3 its representation is not greater than 256 time. The hypothesis is false. The results of the implication is true. So this is a witness for this existential claim and same things true for the last example.  Where we have a false and the true and because of how implication works this also produces true when the hypothesis is false B application produces.  I'm so both of these are witnesses, which means be here is correct.  This is actually a bit of a I put this up as a bit of a cautionary example where a implications inside exists are a little bit. They're often true in a sort of useless way. It's true. But thanks for all the rows where Ella Vex is true. We would need Emma's ex to be true for that to be a witness. And that's not a particularly interesting conclusion to draw so often it's more useful to use something like a conjunction like and then implication inside an existential location gives us peace order vacuously true cases.  So I hear someone and and or for L&M, so instead of implication, let's talk about and and or and I also want to talk about this for all speakers. It's interesting to just think about these two these two predicates that are on different parts of the table and what it means for them to overlap in different ways. So let's think about it weather for all so let's think about which of these is a counterexample for the or case here, but not a counterexample for aunt  Something about this question from now.  All right 5/4.  3  2 1  where did some people go there were more who answered the first round?  No one wants to give a second opinion.  Okay, so, let's see. So let's think about these what we want to think about here is if any of these give us false for one of these cases and not for the other case is really counter-examples to give us false for these cases and what are things that Carlos was playing out to me in the student agrees with and actually going to go back and do it on this slide.  How many do you see the mistake on the sly? Where's the mistake on this why I made a mistake?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, it wasn't you heard us talking freely on I'm so happy about this. So the mistake here is this number if we were to add this up this position is 2 to the 7th not to the gate. So this number is 129. Not not 257. There should be seven zeros for it to be 257 are the basic Mansion work. So it doesn't actually at all. It just means the name of x's Falls for this value and it still produces true. We would need to put one more zero in here for it to be.  For this to be true for him and back. I just want to be clear about that the representation I picked with all these zeros is missing 10 to go above 256 Trigger 2.  So if we wanted to talk about so actually let me put up the answers and see if anyone wants to justify why they cuz he was very popular among the after discussion answer. Are you for arguing in favor of e are you in favor of e? Yeah, go for it.  interesting  Now you're saying how could it be false for an orbit true for an aunt? That sounds like a nice intuition coming from intuition that says if both of them are false, how can both of them be true and true that doesn't seem like it's something that could happen interesting is that you so we're so you're saying basically in every position where the old is part of it is also produce false. No matter what this is if we have those two predicates there.  Yeah, so you're saying that L&M form a contradiction so they're always false. So they're always fall because if we go back if we think about the the table for all these values we have all of the X values here.  And I'm just going to use here like 110 and in somewhere way down here.  We start to have True Values for the other predicate when this turns into a one down here.  And these are all false.  And this is false and these are false examples of the first claim. So it's hard to find an example here. That's a counterexample for the first but not for the second but not for this.  So I want to talk I'll see action when a skip this one for now and talk about DNA for the last couple minutes because there's some really interesting examples using one, and I want to make about your worksheet is that I put stars on the properties that I did on the slide the ones that don't have stars are just there for you to think about there are actually all kind of interesting to think about their on the worksheet. But the ones that are stars of the ones that that flashed up on the Flies are we talked about on the slide? So if you want more practice on this just a lot on there to look at  DNA for the last 10 minutes and some properties about DNA and I have a few different products. I want you to just take a minute to read these different feeling in a couple values for the different predicate on your own then we'll still some in together and talk about some interesting properties here at least by product gets here.  Okay, so I just want to highlight a few interesting things that we  See in what in the rose that are here in this table and start asking some questions. So first of all, the very first row is saying I'm the Strand starts with a and all these products are over strands of DNA by all these products are over these sequences. Each of the bases is 1 of 80 g and the definition of a strand is that it's a nonempty sequence. So we're going to have some number of letters in a row all of the all the letters are going to be from that set of four letters were talking about some properties of strands. The First Column is 1 strands that start with a in the second column is strands that end with t that end with T. So, for example, we have a true for the Strand it's just tea we have a true here. We have a true here and we have bosses in the other places.  Italic season of surgeries and pulses in monospace font is the basis. So if you see a t in both places like the code fonts tea and italics to use the true t  What's the weather this interesting call him that's called the product called P tag and says s, tag is a double helix, which means that s has to have the matching the matching characters with t a g to make a double helix, in an in the rose that I've shown from here to hear. These are all false because none of these are even three bases long to match with Samantha tag in part of the property of a double helix, is that the two strands that make up a double helix have the same number of bases in?  Similarly, we don't have any that we see in this table so far. There may be some further down in the table that start with a t  this last one's interesting. Are there any true rose for this last one in the table that we have? So far true rose for this last one in the table that we have so far just with what we can see here.  Estee Lauder, I hear people saying stuff out.  80eighty so if he was saying 80  80 this is a true over here.  The true and I'm just since the way I don't have columns row markers.  40a  set ideas when we reverse it do things match up.  So when we reverse the reverse the spring when you have these things matching.  So let's talk about a few properties of these because there's some interesting properties to discuss you. One of the first things I want to do is call back to our notation that we use when we were talking about some of these bit-bit representations and numbers which of these representations on the right hand side. Here is an accurate symbolic representation of this s starts with a t c predicate which one of these if we allow for  This is really a question about notation. So.  5 4 3 2 1 the answer is here.  in this answer  Which is I would say is not correct. We're forcing the length of strands to be three bases long free, which is this fixed-length three base sequence has to satisfy this property all of the Strand all possible strands of DNA which is why there's an important distinction between writing a and writing D that have a sequence of bases. We're just looking at the first three to say starts with  So another question here is how many elements in the domain make this true this particular predicate true that starts with a T see, how big is it?  five four  3 2  1  so first starting with a t see there's lots of elements that start with a t c and have more bases in them. For example, a TCA lots of examples we can generate there longer than 3 characters or longer than 3 bases long and set this a truce that that is also not just like some fixed size truth that the truth that keeps going to I'm so this is interesting because with the symbolic representations of predicate we can really have these sets that go on and on and on.  How about this one? How about representing that s, t a g is a double helix, which one of these are notations talks about this predicate one of these is a good representation.  5 4 3 2 1 so again, but this isn't important notational Point here again about B, and I'm making this point because I don't want you to make this mistake.  so be here we should still not use this fixed-length definition for "
