    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started.  Good morning, everyone. Welcome back. And let's just want to have a few quick announcements and I want to dive back into talking about number representation. The only reminders I want to make sure I give you are when we have deadlines coming up to get used to the sort of sequence of deadlines in the course. So the follow-up for the introduction of notation assignment for calling zero follow up tomorrow evening. And then the warm up for homework 1 is due tomorrow evening, then that'll be due next Monday. So Thursday is you should expect these follow-ups and warm up to me. And then Monday evenings expect the homework to be do and we've been getting some good questions, And remember that the follow-up to the follow-up you should be working on alone the homework so you can work with a partner and the warm-ups. Feel free to talk to anyone about those questions in the warm-up.  The one that have the sort of multiple choice check boxes text box answers on gradescope and the others you'll be typing up in summoning a PPI.  Are any questions about any Logistics before we get started?  Okay, cool, so I want to talk about negative numbers today we didn't talk about negative numbers on Monday and so I won't extend their representations to talk about those cuz if you interesting choices we can make with negative numbers and then I want to talk about representing logical operations a bit and we're going to have a couple representations for doing doing Logic on bits on zero and those are going to help us understand how computers are physically built so we're going to work through some of those things today too, but I want talking about negative number and I'm bringing up our definitions of the positive integers first because these are what we're going to extend we had this idea of a base B expansion of a number and then we will find it to talk about mixed with the big deal on Monday is the numbers being in a particular base  I'm leading zeros on the representation of the number for basically we had a fixed set of coefficients. We were allowed to use and this match is how computers represent numbers cuz they often have Beats fixed with binary representation of numbers that we use all over the place. So this fixed with representation is pretty important and the representation that are negative is to say we are going to use part with usually one bit worth of that with or one digit or one coefficient about with to represent negativeness for whether the number is it positive or negative number choices? We could make and how we choose to use that bit and what the rest of the digits for the rest of the coefficients in the number mean. There's a few different representations. We could try a few different definitions. We could try and three of those common ones and these are what we're going to explore and figure  Why some of these are actually I would say better than others are called sign magnitude ones complement in twos compliment, but I want to read them at you to take a second read these definitions talk about them for a second and then we're going to do a bunch of examples with really a full minute read these definition talk to each other questions that you have about them. Then we're going to do a bunch of examples.  All right, so I want to go through a few of the examples that are on on the worksheet. Now for the worksheet asks you to think about two specific numbers think about 15. I want to start working through those so that we can see what they look like. You need different representation.  Take me to First Row this road sign magnitude. This representation says we're just going to use the leading bit are the leading coefficient is positive or negative the digits. I'm so if we wanted to represent 15 in sign magnitude, and I'm going to pick 6, and then I'm going to use for all of these so we can use with wood sticks that also matches the example at the bottom is with six. Just means we have to calculate these examples down here just means we do the usual calculations / 15 + 4 + 2 + 100 in an eighth place before his place the tooz place.  In the ones place that would be 15 and sign magnitude the positive version and then if we had 15 in the negative version that's going to be the same magnitude of the negative sign in the front same magnitude, but with a negative sign in the front and the negative sign is represented by this one.  This is a reminder that one place to his place 4th Place 8th Place 16th Place in this number that zero and then that leading coefficient of that leading digit is representing positive or negative sign magnitude. This will be representations of a 15 + -15  Just a thought in mind with with with the wind sticks take take a couple seconds and think about what one's complement is going to look like before I do it. What's the ones complement road going to look like? It's going to be different. So think about both of these for the ones complement row 415 and -15 ones complement.  Alright, so is the first one the representation of 15. How does that what does that look like? What does representation 215 look like in this one's complement representation positive 15 look like  Be the same be the same any other.  Yes, actually this definition looks to be exactly the same for all of them right actually if the numbers are positive  the definitions are exactly the same -15 + -15  Inverted version of positive 15 based on their is summarizing the definition in English sentence.  What Pacific coefficients?  Is the first bit going to be 0 or 1 and shout it out one? Okay. What about the second? What about the second coefficient coefficient right after that one next one? And so this is what we mean by inverted right? We're going to take all of those digits in just 0 to 100 and representation complement representation of -15 complement representation. What's that going to look like? It's not going to look like  look like  What kind of talked about this one for a second just going to give a short amount of time for this to come up with? I want you to write down and come up with an answer that you think is going to work After the two's complement representation of -15 Hickory seconds really write this really trying to write this down into the store.  Alright any suggestions for the two's complement of negative fifteen suggestions who want to give it a shot?  What's the first coefficient going to be times that right? What's the next electrician going to be?  I heard one in there. That doesn't mean that so I'm going to put a load? What's the last digit and went and I'm want so there is something we can start a check this against the formula is given for two's complement. Now, there's a couple ways to go about calculating the complement more easily or with sort of a check now that we have a potential answer. So the definition says that we're going to have this equation satisfied of the bottom, which is 2 W - 1 - 10 whatever this Space 2 expansion represents.  -1 in this case, that's two to the five because mine is annwyl and is the number we're trying to represent in the number we're trying to represent is 15 and so that would be 32-15. So that means we want the base 2 expansion of 17 as the rest of the number and silver trying to represent 15 you want this to the 5th, which is 32 - 50, but we should get for this part of the number indeed that the one in the 16th Place and a 1 in the ones place.  there's another way to go from a to get a tooth compliment number which is an interesting trick that works out, which is you do the same thing you do for the ones and then add one to the number to do the same thing you do for the ones complement and add one to the number and that's another trick for calculating into this formula is enough to usually figure out what you want to do because if you have end provided it's easy to calculate if you are trying to find and you can use this formula to figure it out as well as formula is a really nice constraint to know about  So be there in three different representations of negative numbers sign magnitude to me at least is the obvious thing to try first and then other one teaches about what they're good for and why we might care about using one over another.  So the first question 0 we're doing all of this flipping of these coefficients from 120 were using one at the beginning of the number two mean different things useful to understand where there are zeros in this representation. So which of these numbers represent zero and what would 0 look like in each one?  4 3 2 1  Just got this one has a little bit of variety of answers that people gave.  Okay. I'm going to leave this open for another 30 seconds picking again with an updated answer for this question based on discussing with folks around you.  5 4 3 2 1  All right, so I want to just look at ABC in order and we can say something about each of them. So kind of uncontroversial E20. It's definitely just a binary representation no matter which one of these we pick actually this gives us the representation of because we're saying that we're not doing any of the interesting complimenting or flipping deaths and then the actual magnitude of the number is zero from so this is definitely at least one representation of 0.  0111 and 1 complement leading. The leading coefficient is 0 which means we're on the left hand side of the definition and that means that were using definition. We're real magnets in treating. Has the entire the entire value of the number. So the magnitude is going to be 7 for this doesn't represent zero. When is the leading zero we're just adding up the coefficients to the right power as usual.  Free is an interesting case don't see where he's talking about a leading one.  And then all zeros in the tooth compliment representation. So leading one and then all zeros in the two complement representation. So what is this? What is it mean in terms of the formula that we have for to compliment? We're definitely on the right hand side. So we're going to be using this equation is here the winds in all these examples.  For so this is going to be saying 2 to the 3 - n is equal to up whatever the rest of the represent after the sign after the signed. So whatever the rest of the coefficients represent and the rest of the coefficients are a000. So we're looking at this equation, which is 2 to the 2 to the 3 - 0 is what this must represent. So that means that n is equal to 8.  Stop supporting to this equation this number 1000 in base 2 in twos complement represent negative 8 deleting y means it's negative calculation to make we just we've checked these off as knowing what they are but these are not zero, so just to be clear a check list not not an indicating which ones are easier either of these represents zero only a represents there.  enter this interesting thing going on with with representing -8 that's kind of interesting compliments or complements with only four be here cuz I'm positive 8  compositing the biggest number we could represent would be well be actually kind of tells us he has is positive 7 and that's the largest number we can represent with zero as the leading coefficient the most negative one bigger than at least in to stop at least.  Another question is worth asking is what are the representation representation or representations of zero in one in Tucson Plymouth one and twos complementary saw it for just regular binary two's complement. We need to talk about this for a second. What what are they are there more than one is there just to complain if we wanted to represent zero about that for a second. What are the representations of 0?  Alright, so what are some thoughts here? What are some thoughts here about zeros and ones and twos complement zeros and ones and twos compliment.  And we can stick with wigs for from the last example.  Interesting, so it's actually worth pointing out that first example all zeros definitely works in both of these we have magnitude 0 and sine 0 any other suggestions for one's complement four ways to represent zero.  Let's try this right to one's complement tells us the leading coefficient is negative is complimenting all the other day. So that means it's negative 000 base base to which is negative zero.  -0  has two ways to represent zero negative zero doesn't mean much different than zero interesting to talk about the idea of why negative zero might be a different value than zero in the math. We do math were talking about where we're just using integers. There's no difference between a 0 * -1 + 0. There's no special value negative zero What's Happening Here is one compliment has two ways to represent the values 0 that number zero shows up twice in the one's complement representation the same as one followed by all zeros. That's also a representation of 0.  Interesting Lee in to complement this doesn't happen. Right? We saw in the last side. In fact that one followed by a bunch of zero doesn't give us zero and a one followed by a bunch of ones also wouldn't give us to euro into some point. If we do this out that ends up being negative one because of this.  Set to stun someone has the benefit that there's only one representation of 0 and a nice. It's like we get to represent that -8 instead of representing zero twice. That's actually what's happening between one's complement to compliment. Most negative number can be represented instead of representing zero twice.  I want to talk about comparing these it just in one example here to see why so that's one reason why it might be useful. It may give us this one extra number we can represent. That's nice. But let's talk a little bit about some other kind of comparison we can do here. So what I have at the top and what's on your worksheet is a little bit of arithmetic. So it's a binary arithmetic of these two numbers. We should interpret them as being in days to  And I wanted to do out the arithmetic for these to show what we get for a result for adding these two numbers in binary representation. We pick for them whether they're in unsigned sign magnitude one's complement we can just do we get a zero here. We get a zero here and carry a week 1  This is just doing the arithmetic based on these coefficients that we're seeing here and see what it means in each representation. So I'm going to ask you to think about the others little bit unsigned the first the first argument here the first some in the thing at the top. So this is 1 1 0 1 0 0 8 16 32 32 + 4.  So 32 + 16 + 4 VIPs together, we should expect that our answer is 57 and we can check that against so we have 32 + 16 + 8 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 that's equal to 57 in binary binary find with six binary representation of a binary.  When going to do this next for sign magnitude do this on your own for sign magnitude. What is the first time and represent? What is the second summon represent? And what is the sum represent? If we interpret all three of those numbers that we did in the arithmetic sign magnitude numbers on the question being does it still work out? So try this on your own for the sign magnitude representation of the translation.  If you want keep going onto ones and twos compliments will talk about next.  All right. So what is this top number the top number? 1 1 0 1 0 0 what does that represent in Sign Language. What's the what is the what number does that represent integer?  Raise a hand against the number to the top on represent.  -15 negative  photos of some seared in the bottom row. 1  Yeah, okay. So starting with -20 is the the top one and then we'll we'll get down to talking about those results. So the first time and was -20 and some place in the forest place that are adding up to that magnitude is 20 and then the negative because of the leading one.  So the second some and then I think it's positive. This is more straightforward again answer that we should get if we do the math, right? So I'm going to split this into two different ways of thinking about this. So this is the math answer right? We would hope that we produce -15 if we do out the math here.  What is the value of a result that we got by doing a bit? Why is arithmetic?  -25  oops  So this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what it means is that we can't just do the regular add and carry process for adding together to sign magnitude number that does not work to add to sign magnitude numbers. If you want to add to sign magnitude numbers, you need to do more work the first check was positive and negative then figure out if you're adding or subtracting basing up based on if it's positive or negative innocent fact, you can't just do this regular edition process does not produce answers that are faithful to what we would expect map to do.  So this means this just means that we have to be more careful. When we do arithmetic with these look like for one's complement just look like for one's complement. What's the definitely were going to have five and all these places for all these representation negative the first number in one's complement.  first number one's complement  one compliment  -11 of 11 degrees of this is that would be we think about the magnitude of that in one's complement. We're looking at 0 1 0 1 8 + 2 + 1 is that gives us -11 + -11 and 5 together the math answer that we would hope to get is -6 and then we should ask Autumn result represents -6 in 1 complement 0 1 1 0  That's 6 so the bitterest mistake answer for what we did above answers what gives the same answer is what we would hope to get.  That's pretty cool.  That's pretty interesting.  What is the top number represent in twos complement representing to compliment?  top number in twos complement  . Is up make sure we make sure we know what we're looking at here. We're looking at 1 this is the expansion for the magnitude part of it.  And we're saying that should be equal to 2 to the Innocence. Would 602 to the 5 minus whatever and we're trying to find who the five minutes whenever and we're trying to find the right is ones Twos for is 8/16 + 16 + 4 that's going to be 20 that we're representing with the magnitude there.  3232  is 20 + 20 + 10 + moving numbers around here while I'm due does not do what I expect.  And so this is -12  self is interesting is also related to the trick I said for you can flip the digits and add 1 so you'll often see these relationships when you look at one ones and twos compliments numbers to look like this.  So we should hope to get a -7 out of I want to cover lecture today. In fact This falls out as being the right arithmetic results as well.  Someone compliment and complement have the benefit that even though they represent a mix of positive and negative numbers when we do.  We can get answers that reflect what we want to get in actual math.  We can get these answers out that reflect the mathematical answers and that's pretty cool. And it's a good reason to use one compliments as a representation inside a computer because it makes implementing arithmetic easier inside a computer because the computer ends up not having to do extra work differentiate between his number is as to compliment numbered we can just do regular edition as a result of the two properties. We've talked about one property being at math works out and the other property being that represent compliment.  What we end up having is that this is used by computers.  Most most hardware and most low-level systems are built to use a tooth complement representation of integers when negative numbers are needed because of these properties.  That's really interesting. Yeah, they are asking if we had an example you're saying is  What if we had zero one and I'm just going to do it in four bits to be?  Temperature make it short, right? So you're saying we out of these together. No, definitely in the unsigned World totally makes sense. We're adding for in 4 and we would get 8 but in the signed world, what is this mean for the representation we get out what happened? And so if the answer here for the arithmetic is this week and see what value would get out in twos compliment. And in fact, you've shown by it with this example where this fixed with limitation comes in. So 1000 as we saw on the side with a trick question is the most we add it to the limit of the positive numbers we could represent and then wrap wrapped around negative or the positive side came back on the negative side. I lied a little bit when I say  Represent with those sort of w - 1 W - 2 part of the number and we're going to wrap around me about the mod operation and remainders and using them with the allowed range Falls outside the range it actually sort of switches from positive to negative. So you can you do actually get a consistent understandable answer. It's not nonsense. It's just you can't represent positive 8in 4 bit signed to compliment. So you end up with you end up getting another number.  the great buster  Some other questions about this because this is this is a move on to something else next to this is sort of the last the last night. I'm going to have up above these representation in the the punch line here is this is why we use to compliment.  I'm sorry why we change the first?  Great question. Why do we sing the first summon but not the second summon. So when the leading coefficient is 0 representations of the same there and so it could definition of the easiest way to start a reminder self about in the definition. Is it the Left End really is  Can you answer questions about these representations of numbers before we go on?  Why would the computer use a tooth come from in over the ones complement? It's nice to be able to represent one more number and it's nice to know that you have zero without having to compare it to two different values. So if you wanted to ask if a number is equal to 0 you might have to ask is if he will deposit of 04. Is it equal to -0 and there's more work to do there. Checking and so having the unique representation of zero is nice. You also get the extra representation of that most negative number so you can represent more numbers.  So I guess you saying that that like to check in with my behavior?  That's interesting. So you're asking about computers doing this extra operation to Inver bits and add one in this thing about this arithmetic. They do the same operation. Like we just did we did the same arithmetic operation and if we interpret it is to compliment we get the right answer and if we interpret it as we get the right answer the key thing about we don't do any extra work to do a representation and somewhere we would be forced to confront this to representations of zero all the time right into some point. We're not forced to confront that there's a difference between computer operation.  Programmers are we as algorithm designers would have to think about equality meaning.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Let me let me I'm just going to rearrange the this so that it's above here cuz these were the two Wright these were really the two parts here that were the the summons for one compliment. So that's why the calculation out for how I figured out that 12 was the magnitude here. So other people can write position to talk about the next time the next day and this is directly related to a lot of the conversations. We just had about representing.  File binary numbers in binary operations we need to do with a low level in a computer to actually build this.  And the high-level picture here is that computers physical machines represent bits or 0 and 1 coefficients in one of the fundamental building blocks for building up a computer. Is it taking circus that have voltage is coming in on multiple wires and cause different voltages to come out on otherwise, we're not going to think hard about electricity and voltages in this class. We're going to say that every wire is either carrying a 0 or a 1 on it from what it means to do bit by bit arithmetic we can start to think about what kinds of operations we want these circuits to be able to do and given some circuit we can build up some of these operations like arithmetic and interpreting numbers in interpreting numbers.  So the idea here is where you going to draw certain shaped boxes that represent particular operation convert incoming ones and zeros to outgoing ones and zeros in a bar model or a representation and what's going on inside Hardware.  So I want to talk first about I actually was the first example I want to do we're going to talk about circuits pretty generally in the course, but I want to bring this back to the example we've seen so far which is doing this bit by bit or one column at a time addition of zeros and ones and there's a few things that this relied on this relied on the ability to add two symbols together. So to add to single digits together to single coefficients together that are either zero or one and then also you sing this out in going from this column to this column. I wrote down a carry up here. I carried the one when I went from that third to Fourth column from right to left and implicitly and all the other column.  I was carrying a zero right? There was nothing carried over from the past from the last couple things involved in calculating. We need to be able to add single digits and then do this carrying operation. We as a people who learned in our lives.  But I had to start somewhere with sort of the ground Truth for what it meant to add a single-digit together. And in addition right there's a table and when we do addition this is actually getting a little bit back to the question of what if we add a number that's too big to represent the number of fits inside. But then in his box triangle the bottom half of this picture you get these interesting cases.  Where for example 5 + 5 digit you when you do arithmetic there would be zero when you do 5 + 5 + 9 + 1 + 0 + you keep track of a carry and we can do this the same picture for the binary addition table one if we had zeros and zeros or zeroes and if we had a one-and-one the resulting digital zero with a carry the same logic as what we learn to do when we learn to do digit by digit arithmetic in base ten just simplified and thinking about this case where we add together to ones and get a 0 and it is important for for building circuits.  I want to talk about what it means to add together these two digits and basically summarizes a bit of what I was saying screen care, which is in base 2 which is we can draw a possibility one out of two zero and so on and then I'll put swear i a s here is what we call the summer the result bit and then is the the Caribe it, Nancy is going to Stanford Carrie and this is all just a little bit.  Is what we're going to do is talk about a building of circuits that can do these operations. And this is what we're going to talk about look like so like I said, there's going to be wires coming into boxes and then wires coming out of boxes and we're going to talk about values of zero in one that flew across these boxes and produce results.  and this is  the set of we call them that's going to produce a one symbol some that are coming in and then use two outputs with some in the Carrie bit are coming out.  And we can show exhaustively what all of those things are going to be and I just want to highlight these shapes or shape for going to be seeing a lot. So we're going to do differently shaped boxes with a word in them that represent these different operations. And in fact, these tables are summarizing what we mean by a thorn. And so and this is the one bit exactly when the two inputs are both one. Otherwise, it produces 0 + x or produces one bit exactly when the different exclusive or logic gate that we use to build up circuits and these two together exorun and in this configuration describe one digit addition.  So one question I want to ask so this is going to be how I wrap up the class today. If I asking this question, which is a bit of a speculative question because we're going to talk about is how to do a large editions of many many bits like the ones that we did it with 6 is how many single digit addition do you think we need to do in order to add together to two digit binary numbers? It's a two two digit binary numbers. How many one bit thumbs do you think her involved here in out of me? So I'm just going to have you discussed for the one minute that's left and then I get answers in and I'm going to close it down. "
