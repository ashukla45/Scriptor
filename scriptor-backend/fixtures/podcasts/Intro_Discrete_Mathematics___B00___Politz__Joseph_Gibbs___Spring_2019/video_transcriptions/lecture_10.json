    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. Let's get started. Good morning. Everyone. Happy Monday. Hope you had a great weekend deadline reminders for this week. Are that second homework is due tonight. So Monday is the homework so do so today what we're going to thank you today. What we're going to talk about is refined product gets a little bit more today. And the thing we're going to do is talk about predicate that take triple as argument for their domain is a set of tuples because this is going to let us relate multiple values to one another so far all the predicate we've talked about have just had sort of one value as their argument like one one DNA strand or One number or one bit string representing a binary number eight multiple values in this is where we get some really interesting structure in problem. So we're going to build up what we need to talk about predicates that have a domain that's two bowls of value. So what are the main tools we're going to need to do this is this called Cartesian product which lets us take to Seth and then talk about a set the combination of the elements from those set and I just want to highlight a couple points in this definition. So the definition here in this is I just copy pasted this from the textbook says if a and b are sets the Cartesian product with is a x b or a cross B, sometimes I pronounce that symbol that's in between A and B Cross or X is the set of all ordered pairs a b, b 2 2-pole to refer to ordered pairs, but the book called them ordered pairs as well, But we usually have been saying to teufel in the assignment write ups with Britain 2 - 2 years in the SAC Capital B. And then there's a way of writing it out with that Builder notation. So the idea here is we can take two sets and build a new set out of them. And the news that is all the ordered set of ordered pairs of all the combinations of elements from those two steps. So we just take all possible combinations of two elements for a new set of tuples to talk about is going to let us talk about these bigger selection that are built out of smaller collection. I want to get some practice with this. So I've written out a set here that the set of two two poles in the question. And then what I want to ask is which of the uses of Cartesian product or cross product produced or equal to this set and do let me to do two rounds on this to please do the first-round quietly and then I'll have you discussed. So which of the options below tonight? I change my clicker frequency. Let me have to change it back. Sorry about that. In here, it's ba. 5 4 3 2 1  Okay Cricket again. There's a fair amount of agreement but not everybody agreed. So I just want to see what happens on a second round.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay. Alright. So the man is the main thing I want to focus on is if is it a works or not. So looking at a which is the set containing 0 across the set containing one or the second painting zero Cartesian product with the set containing one where we have to wear the first element in a tube corresponds to the lowercase a has to come from the first step and the second element that's the lower case has to come from the second set 01 is definitely two to full or an ordered pair that we can get from the cross product of these two sets.  And that's it. There's no other ordered pairs are no other to two fools we can get by taking elements from the first step in the second set and building Super Bowl all of the first elements in the temple that corresponds a have to come from the first and there's only one element in the first-set. So the product of 0 II painting zero and this is just this to Tuple continues Irwin one option that produces the set above and it's the only option I put them in a different in different orders here because I wanted to emphasize that I don't want to say doesn't matter but represents the same set the set written and set notation is one zero is equal to the set written in set notation a 01  Both of these two sets of zero in one available so we can generate all of these combinations 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 from the cross product of these two cents any other options, but I also don't work. Abby wouldn't let us generate either. So be is wrong because be would not let us generate either of these two elements in the cross product cuz there's no one in the first set and then D is actually representing sort of the same two sets just at the cross products in the order as a because when we write duplicates and set notation. We we just that doesn't actually ever have duplicates in it the really the set that we written in d-11.  Is equal to the sac containing just 1 and 0 0 is equal to the sac containing just hero. So some of this is reminders about set notation and also this new idea that we use in class at all before of these Cartesian product built up from his other sets.  Any questions about any of the notation in on this slide for sex really starting to use that's more in class. So I just want to have this is a reminder set notation and take any questions you have before going on.  Okay, so I want to use this idea of Cartesian products and related to products now. So I want to take care about talk about two numbers at the same time. So let's think about a predicate that takes her to to pull over and ordered pair of two values X and Y is true when X and Y are both even and the question I want to ask is what are some interesting domains or what are possible domain for us to use to describe this predicate so that it has a domain X. Is it to Temple X and Y has to come from some domain. How can we describe that domain in English or symbolically keeping in mind that we have this new idea of Cartesian products around you represent represent the domain of this predicate.  What are some domains we can talk about for the predicate?  Okay. So what are some suggestions from this section of the classes section all the way to my right discussions you had about possible domains for this predicate this predicate that's on the screen.  Domains domains from the front half of this section. So these fees for rose ideas for the domain if it's supposed to rain.  Someone from the front half of the front half of this section over here. What are some ideas you had for the domain of this predicate?  It's just going to get smaller someone from the right-hand side of the front half of the front half. What are some ideas for the domain of the spreading the domain?  all real numbers real numbers awesome awesome  How about somebody from the second? I just got everyone out over there. So let's go there this section. Tell me more. Tell me more. Are there other options is all real numbers what you wanted to use. What else did you discuss?  maybe two sets  see the real interesting candidate ideas. Do you want to say any more about which stuff?  So just that maybe one set for the x's and one set for the wise is that the that the kind of idea maybe some kind of other ideas?  coincide  the set of all even numbers  other ideas other ideas  So I'm writing the time symbol of the cross symbol here the Cartesian product symbol here and you're saying it we want the Cartesian product between integers integers and we often write the integers with the double thick line in the middle notation with a little bit interesting ideas.  All of these are reasonable things to be talkin about and the set of all real numbers is another one we can talk about we can talk about for example, we often write the set of all real numbers as a fake leg on the big leg of the are although I do that or the domain of ordered pair the suitable of number so it might be interesting to talk about this having a domain. That's the cross product of all the real numbers with all the real numbers that would give us of to to folder a set of ordered pairs doing the cross product hear the set of all even numbers is interesting to think about again, if we just had a set of numbers that sort of doesn't match the input to the predicate so we might have to talk about the set of all even numbers cross the set of all even numbers in order to be talking about a set of tuples the key thing here is that this kind of description  The domain these two things talk about sets.  of  in particular to two bowls and hear what we're saying when we right now and pee and then this stupid is that  must be a set some set of tuples and we can talk about what numbers were interested in talking about in terms of even this year. Whether were interested in the integers or positive integers are real depending on the problem. We might need a specific set of number that we want to talk about. But the main point here is we would have to talk about this set of tuples to two bowls of numbers for this to make sense with the earth rotation. There is no reason why in this problem managers vs. Reals is particularly more right than the other but we have to be talking about that the two to bowl for this notation to make sense another example of going to have a similar flavor with two positions in the predicate. So let's have this predicate but I wrote It's called keelin and the meaning of teal Ln on a two-pole s&n is that the DNA strand s has links and so it's true exactly when the DM  How's the length of this input? So when I asked the same question again, what what is a reasonable domain for us to describe for this predicate? How would we describe the set of tuples that we could use as Arguments for this product or as inputs to describe? What are domains for this predicate?  alright, so what are some suggestions here for the domain would use to describe this predicate peel n this length predicate maybe someone from the left hand side of this middle section hear some suggestions for domain of this predicate the domain  domain  maybe there be some kind of to playing some kind of people within a two-pole talk about the structure of this strand plus the structure of combining with his number other ideas other ideas of this middle section other ideas for the domain of this domain of this Friday like we had four other ways you can you talk about representing a domain.  So maybe there's some sort of structure especially we talked about double helix has that makes there be some kind of even number and this year has been just the single strand of one American thinking about the structure of the Strand other ways people thought about the domain of this domain here.  Turn on negative integers cross the set of non-negative integers. So again, we have these two these two two numbers put together an ordered pair.  Maybe the cross product of all possible DNA strands with all non-negative integers is all of these are useful ideas look like for the predicate in the bunch of tables for predicates now where we have an input, and we talked about what all the inputs could be and then we talked about having these predicate columns It produced true or false.  And so if we have inputs that are strands and numbers friends number two bowls, that's what this predicate is talking about. We need to refer to a DNA strand and it's length is a number then the inputs are going to be things like the DNA strand a and maybe let's say the number one.  That's an example of something that could be an input to this predicate and this particular case. We would expect that to produce true because this  Here's another example in put another example and put is a and I'm not doing this in any particular order. I'm just coming up with some ideas of what example inputs could be here another example and could be an actual. It's just my handwriting doesn't do the font differently. So let's not use it. See here could be a G1 and bases in it. And the input is saying it's like there's one that's not true. That's not true for the predicate to produce false there. So the first thing is a DNA strand and the second thing is some kind of number that relates to its link. So in this case what I would expect to see as describing these to Seth well, we can say something like that.  Of all DNA strands, which we've defined a few times now.  And let's say is the set of positive.  integers  and ask cross Z Plus  is a good description of the kinds of inputs we have here but it definitely makes DNA strands of the first elements in these two poles and some kind of number as the second element needs to be some kind of interesting other ideas that came up like maybe nothing to Apples or maybe talking about the evenness of the length and I think I might decide truth or false based on like if it had to be even length of the predicate the kinds of values the predicate works over are these ordered pairs of strands and then some number that's what's described here. And then we can talk about each pair of a strand and a number.  the predicate true or false  So this is what this is a kind of predicate we'll talk about. I want to make one other point based on what we've said here, which is that this particular predicate doesn't have a fixed size table for it cuz we didn't say anything about how long the strands can get. One of the first students said this is an example of a table that doesn't affect size about this list of tuples is just going to keep going we can talk about all the positive integers such interesting about this predicate.  I want to make one notational point before we go on in the book in life in math. And in this class. There is an abusive notation that happens. We often write this thing on the left.  To avoid the extra set of parentheses. When we write this thing on the right that I've been writing on the last two slides P parentheses parentheses that the predicate is taking a tuple as an argument and working over the Tuple the notation on the left sort of makes it a little easier to type and maybe a little easier to read by omitting a set of parentheses. But what it means is a Pisa predicate in X & y's is a tuple there. So I just want to be clear that when we write predicate uses a predicate and we just use a single set of parentheses with, separated values. They're usually going to mean this to full bass interpretation on the right notation that happens all over the place in math functions are often defined to take two bulls when they take multiple arguments and people don't write the two sets of parentheses around them, but that's what it means.  Unemployment start using the notation on the left without the extra set of parentheses for the rest of the lecture, but we're going to understand that this means that he takes a tuple.  So let's talk about some examples of this. I want to talk about a restricted example here where I'm going to take this. In this example. If it's on the front of the worksheet says that's what s to S Sub to be the set of DNA strands that just have lengths one or two and then let N be the set 0 1 2 and some just picking a really restricted set a subset of what we talked about on the last side where we talked about all DNA strand and all positive integers. And so we can imagine listing use out since I have the zero Rose there for a t g c and then I started listening out of the Rose a question I have for you to think about as you're building up an understanding of this this domain.  How many rows are going to be in this table? If we take this input to be elements of the set s to cross and as I've defined up here, how many rows are going to be in the stable talk about this briefly. And then how many rows are going? How many rows will be here?  Okay how to do any suggestions for how many of how many rows you think will be in this table Yeah 60 other suggestions.  Suggestions other than 60 60 60. So for each one of these values of n we have to talk about all of the pair's we could generate with each one of the strands that are in the set and the strands that are in the are going to be a t g c and every combination of two letters. So all these other ones like aat and so on and this is going to be four bases and their two positions the 16 combinations of putting them in order. There were four that were one length. So that's 20 different strands that we can go to and then we'll have a pair that we create for each one of those strands freeze value of M will have this 20 appearing three times once for each value of n  Hang out with every possible strandedness set paired with every possible number in 01 to weed get a total of 60. And so the answer to can we lift them all is absolutely size table fits going to have six zeros in it.  Let's talk about some examples of using this of using this definition for a particular predicate. So there's this worksheet. So I want you to refer to refer to your worksheet for this which is that what are the days that appear in the Strand in if that number is equal to the input and then a predicate produces truth or otherwise, it produces false.  So the idea here is that we're going to be able to talk about Witnesses for this based on counting numbers at 8. I'm so I'm writing out this statement there exists such that the predicate for the count of Azor number of ace of tea is true. Which of these which of these is a witness.  5 4 3 2 1  just going to do a second round. That's really short.  Okay Quicken again Quicken again.  K 5 4 3 2 1  okay, so there were a fair number of people who answered a  And I agree with that. There is one a base appearing in the The Strand GI and the number is one. So this is definitely a witness for their existing a tuple where the predicate evaluates to true.  Once I get this next one.  So the predicate says that the number given is equal to the count of the number of A's and the Strand in the Strand Gigi. There are no ways. There's 0/8 + 0 equal to that count today. Is that appear in that strand? So this is also a witness for this property described by TV number of ace.  See you in a little bit interesting. It's the count is wrong. So we definitely can't use this as witness the value isn't he will talk about Seymour in the next question and be the account would have to be to for this to be so that the answer here is more than one of these.  Because this is a and b both a and b a r a.  Another question is what's a counterexample for this and I'm just using a little bit different notation in the for all here here. I named to the two parts of the two-pole snn. So I would read this as thrall two bowls of s&n PE number that he counts of a time about that is true. So I just go back and forth. I just wanted to show there's these two styles of the way. We can unpack the temple and talked about both parts of it this question, which of these is a counterexample  five four  3 2 1  Okay 5.  4 3 2 1  alright, so  On the main thing. I want to highlight here. We know that these aren't counter-examples because they're Witnesses for the other version of this essential version of this and know their true Focus here is on is on see which is interesting because why is see why is he particularly interesting fact about sea makes it a really interesting example to look at?  It might exist in another set S3 that talks about DNA strands of length 1 2 or 3.  It is not in the domain of P, right. There's two ways. Maybe we can build a bigger stuff that contains it but in particular GGG.  is not  ns2. So this example of GGG one that ordered pair is not in the domain of the account of a it's not in the domain of this predicate and counterexamples have to come from the domain of the predicate. We can make up other values that aren't in the domain and say I found a counterexample domain so I can't say hey my predicate works over positive numbers and then you say I found a negative number when it doesn't work, right that would really defeat the purpose of me carefully to finding the domain of the right in this in the in that thing right for things in your homework. You have examples where free where you have stay with 4 numbers are with 2 numbers. You can't say. Hi. I found three numbers breaks the property because that's simply outside the domain of discourse for that problem.  Sophie is not a counterexample see is simply something that cannot be an input to pee wee can't talk about the result of pee on GGG, It's simply not in the domain evidence for a counterexample. We have to make sure that the element were looking at is in the domain of the predicate we're working with so the only answer here is the account that's given in the ordered pair is only one and so that's the only counterexample out of these four.  Okay.  So actually let me pause here any questions about this predicate P count today or about the Cartesian products or about the new notation does newt start a new topic coming on the next line. So any questions before we go on about any of us?  All right. So the next thing I want to introduce is this idea that we can take these wanna fires exists and for all and we can mess them so I can go a quantifier expression or Quantified expression can go inside and for all their existing account services in assets equal to an that's how I would pronounce this is like the way I just read out the math for all ass there exists an N such that the predicate for counted on s&n is true and the second is their phone number so I can have that number base.  And so we can talk about what this means in a couple of different ways.  One thing we can do in this works for nested quantifiers where we have a fixed size table like we do in this example, cuz we're talkin about the domain of this predicate being just the strands of length 1 and 2 and just the values of n that are 0 1 and 2 we can think about this is saying for every possible we need this existential statement to be true. And so that means we need to write down as existential statement there exists an N for every possible value of strands in the domain and then and then together we have a big hand for the existentialist to be true when the stranded a lot to be true. When the Strand is the existentialist for each possible value all the way up to CC at the very end which would be the last row in the order. I was writing things down. We have to find an n  And we can find a different n for each one of these is one of the crucial things about the way this is written these different existential don't have to use the same value of n there's a different existential in each Clause are each part of the end and we could find a different value for each one. So one way I like to reorganize the table we had before is just think about the table we get for each value do we could have signed ass. So this is basically taking that big and up there and just using it as a away to reorganize the stable. So there's a bunch of problems here until possible assignment of asked and then all the rows in that column are going to be the inputs where s is fixed to that value of a strand and then we'll talk about all the values of n  So we can start feeling some of this end. So This Is Us on the back here worksheet the table for this and we can start feeling some of this in by asking when it's is true for this first spot here where we have the Strand a and the value energy equal to zero What's the truth value?  And the interesting thing about this way of laying this out.  Is that what we start looking for?  Is we're asking this exists question for each one of these smaller tables. So when we start looking for his can we find a true somewhere? He needs one of these smaller tables and if we can find a true somewhere in every single one of these tables then we justify the exists for every possible input and a true then one of the existing the big and up there would be false in the whole thing would be false.  No, it's interesting to note that this table doesn't have any new information is relative to the old table. We drew there's still going to be 20 of these big columns where we have because we had 20 different possible values for the strands and then each column has these three rows one for each possible value of end table total. We just reorganizing them and then we can talk about the same idea of finding a witness in each one of them.  So that's one order in which we can put the for all which horses are talked about this big and exist in each of those for each of those assignments to the first variable, but we can also talk about flipping them at some number such that for all strands. The predicate is true. So so the short English reading of this would be for some number of strands have that number of Ace for some number all strands of that number base. So I filled in pretty decent chunk of the table for this one. You've even more on your worksheet and the question I have is for the other one we had this symbolic form.  What was the symbolic form be here? Like, what would what would the symbolic form look like for putting this together? Think about what the meaning of the statement is whether you think the statement is true or not. And how you how you write this out? Symbolically. That's the talk about this for a minute. What's the symbolic form of this ordering where we do the exists and then for all  Okay some suggestions. What's this? What is the symbolic form of this look like related to the in the same sort of spirit is the symbolic form of the last example look like  Big yeah, they exist for the existential.  With the upside down a the for all of the universal.  Okay. So on the last one we had it would have been exists and for all and then we have he of the number of days and then we had these different strands in here. And then and then you said and then for all and number of A's and then we have the next thing in order and then.....  Interesting. So you're saying that you want to make this from the different Clauses have a fixed value of n not a fixed value of the Strand interesting interesting. So that's like asking a little different and it says we're going to not pay for all in here and not say a, in here, but instead we're going to stay for all s s, and maybe 0 for the first value of N and not for All In  But for all of us and then we're going to have a sin the next value of n for all.  s + 2  so the idea here is that each one of these Clauses is saying we need to we would have a witness. If one of these Clauses were true because we're asking for an exist for finding some end. So if there's some value of n when we can make all of the answers true then we have a witness for this existential of the thrall.  Each of the four alls and I'm saying every values true because in each of the four alls we would need to have the entire result column be true for the four all to be true from this table that each of these columns for n equals 0 in equals 1 + n equals 2 has a counterexample already. So this is not true. We can definitely see that this is not true. There's counter example, for example here for an equal zero here for any plus one equals two and there's many more and so this is not a true idea of listing things out and getting a counterexample quantifiers on fixed sized domain is we can still use all the strategies reviews for listing things out.  I want to talk next about let me skip this for the moment. I want to talk about doing this for the more General predicate. So talking about what these properties mean when they talk about all DNA strand and all and all positive integers instead of restricting ourselves to be short DNA strands and just being 2012 every DNA strand. There's some DNA strand that can be paired with it to make a double helix. What predicate do we need here? If we wanted to turn this into a symbolic form and what's its domain and then we'll talk about how to write the quantifiers what we need. And what is a domain any suggestions right off the top of your head to go to this a little bit faster than giving funds of discussion times.  What predicate and what's its domain?  Suggestion for the predicate is some predicate maybe we call it H & H needs to take two strands when I call them as one as too and it means that S1 and S2 make a double helix, and we can copy the symbolic definition of double helix from the definition if we wanted but that would be the predicate we need and it still mean would be all all strands cross also has the set of all DNA strand which one of these symbolic forms at the bottom for these nested these nested quantifiers would match. So as soon we have this predicate in each domain is as process which matches this description of the predicate for every DNA strands. There is a DNA strand.  5 4 3 2 1  Just got this. This is actually worth worth a little bit of discussion.  Okay quick and again and again.  5 4 3 2 1 Okay, so  The answer here is C.  And it's important to distinguish T from what some of the others might mean. So in some of the other ones what this would say is for every DNA strand.  it makes  a double helix with every other DNA strand.  And that we can definitely think of counterexamples for off the top of her head and doesn't match this statement that we were going for right? It's for all where there should be in exist in this position in Indy would be saying there exists some strand as to such that it is makes a double helix with every other DNA strand that exists to fix this one DNA strand and then try to match it against every other one. So see if they answer here and the main point here is that we can convert these things from English into these statements, but the different ordering that we picked for the quantifier really change the meeting they changed the way we organize that table "
