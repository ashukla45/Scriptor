    "Full Transcript": "Actually, would you mind just calling the number on there and telling them the projector doesn't work for me while I get started?  That's frustrating.  List all of the numbers there.  Oh, okay.  Okay, let's get started. So I'm going to try and run this without the projector cuz it doesn't seem to be working. So thankfully we have a worksheet. So a lot of the things we need around here.  I want to talk about today are two specific things. So one is working with negating some of the Quantified Expressions. We've been working with so we've talked about the existential Xannies for all and we haven't done a real investigation in front of them and I want to start talking about how we can prove or demonstrate Truth for referrals and having these tables that aren't fixed size around 5, and we weren't able to talk about all the rose.  Recap a little bit.  Just by saying there are two proof strategies. We know pretty well already. I haven't called them proof strategies, but we have been able to say that we can I prove statements like this for all x p of X we can prove these false.  with a counterexample  and statements like exist sex  Pfx, we've been able to prove.  true  weather weather  and those are two ways to give evidence that these statements are true. We've actually done a lot of these and we can prove that a universal statement is false by giving a counterexample is an existentialist True by giving these Witnesses.  The hard part for the thing that's going to become interesting is when we have to prove that after all statement is is true or an existential is false. So when we want to prove something like not for all X.  pfx or sorry  We're curious how to prove this true and how to prove this case false.  Is the two cases that are tricky for us these four cases out for you talking about when each of these cases is true or false. I want you to just just try and describe an English when for all Lexus true and when exist X is false, what does it look like right sort of what you think in English with no statements are true.  I think I'll just try plugging in again.  What's up?  Thanks for being with me. I don't know why this suddenly doesn't work today. So the demonstration we end up needing to do for the negation of an existential if we want to prove that an existential isn't true history in English.  There's no Witnesses. There's no Witnesses describe.  Contre-coup interesting, but it's a contradiction more ways. You describe it more ways. You describe it.  more ways  Yeah.  Every value of the domain makes TX balls you're going to say that while all of these are sort of reasonable things to use for discussion. It's helpful to say what's happening here when an existential is false as we want to say for all the values in the domain we get false if we ask we get false if we ask for that predicate on that value in the domain, there's no place where this would produce true.  That's pretty interesting. Now if we want to prove up for all three, what did you put for proving a for all troop? Would you stay up here for proving a for Altru?  proving a for all through  what's the things that you say?  Note that here we express this one in terms of universal when we have to exist. Is there an existential we can use to express this?  There is not exist the case where?  T-Rexes Falls description  do not exist in case  are there exist a case rpmx his fault that actually sounds like a counterexample there exists a case for this all sounds like a counterexample.  And went down.  So this is kind of interesting because this tells us that there are no this would be a statement that says there doesn't exist any counterexamples. There's some rules and identities for moving around between for Alton existential here to write all the answers for the quicker question until the slide work. So I'm going to move on to something else. One of the points I want to make here is that we are able to think of these as Duels of one another in many ways.  So you can see if we have tried to push negations through we might be able to find hear that these two things on the top row or equivalent. If every bit screw for everything been there doesn't exist. Any any element of the domain where is false? So simple rules for negation definition of other parts of the class today push through the definitions in the book, you'll see that these are equivalent statements. I want to move down. So I'm going to focus on stuff that's on your worksheet so you can see things that are on your worksheet. So if you look on your worksheet, there's a couple reminder is about a few sets the set of integers. I'm also it's worth pointing out that the set of natural numbers in his class always contain zero and then there's a notation for talking about a few different.  What's apps that? I've been abbreviating z+ so like the positive integers not including zero. I want to do a little bit of work with numbers today. So we have this definition at the bottom of your sheep in the idea in factoring is that were talking about when numbers evenly divided one another the definition of factoring says when A & B are integers a / B means there's an integer see such a b equals a times C. This is a statement about evenly multiplying things together to get another number. So the thing I want to have you tried for a minute is there's this definition of a predicate a b  There's two blanks there one is how you would write this symbolically, like what we would actually put if we wanted to have this be symbolic predicate and any other is what the domain of this thing. It's just for a second and then we'll fill them in together.  Let's go with the symbolic part first. What would you write for a symbolic answer here? How would I write this out? If I wanted an expression using the mathematical Expressions reviews and using any other symbols. We've used Emoji right here to evaluate this symbolically.  to represent symbolically  play something from this side of the room.  Man from the front half of the side of the room represent symbolically.  factorable of a bee  Wow, it was really looking away. There's no eye contact.  I'm going to look at your suggestions.  Come behind me in this section right here.  See something. Okay. So I see like a z plus talking about positive integers nice, okay.  Other symbolic ideas, I see for all that exists on some sheets walking around. I see for all of them exist interesting right part of the English statement here is says there is an integer C. There is an integer C is for all statement or an existing.  okay, so there exists some see if there exists some see  And I'm going to be really explicit about this see I want to be precise some cases when we use existentialism for all that's important to be pretty precise about domain we're taking the variables from so just to be clear. It says that there is an integer csoc oughta be some integer and what needs to be true once we've chosen some see needs to be true about that once we've chosen it.  History Sun C such that.  Some see such that what's in a definition?  I heard Whispers. I heard Whispers that look like the move sounds like people are saying something in the definition. It says we need be to be equal to a Time CNA NC right next to each other in the definition that the multiplication if you want to be really explicit we could use like the center. To talk about multiplication the p is equal to 8 times. There is some see such that we have this equation true is mathematically on integers this equation be true, but that don't mean  Set domain here.  see  OC Saiyan God like a such that something they're interesting interesting. I like this idea of using Z. I mean the definition says when A and B are integers and a is non-zero, right so we could say answer you're saying maybe we wanted to find that a minister says integer is not positive integers for example right now, let's actually now I might have a slide that's going to help us a lot.  There we go. There's one thing I wanted to make to the definition that Roseanne gave it's going to make our life easier in class today is I'm going to take this f2b over the domain of all the positive integers are the positive integers which rules out avian 0 which is a case that rosen's definition rolls out and also makes it so we don't have to think about negative numbers, which is just nice.  And let's see.  I want to symbolically we can talk about this factoring predicate and it's going to start to be interesting to talk about this factoring predicate over sort of these entire infinite domains overall numbers. That's that's the kind of thing. I want to be able to say going forward. So there's a reason that we care about this factoring problem. Can we evenly divide a number by another the I'm not going to order we might get to the details of this algorithm later in the quarter not going to have time to talk about it in detail today is not really the Intensive today's class, but there's an idea in cryptography and Herman who's pitching for photography right now can correct me on anything. I say that's a lie right now to make it possible for other people to encrypt data and send it to them one of the steps in the process of publishing a really big number like a really big number.  Two primes together any idea is the only entity that knows how to get that really big number and it's a lot of work for anyone else to figure out how to factor that big number into those Prime's. So I did the Amazon would publish the results of a x b and it would be a lot of work for anyone else to figure out what factors went into what the individual values of A and B are to get that result factoring is hard when factoring is easy when factoring is possible are useful useful questions to ask this turns out to be a matter a lot for basically why you can buy something on the internet without everybody getting your credit card number. So it's worth paying attention to factoring and I want to do some simple problems with it and then build up build up a bit of an understanding here.  There's a couple different uses of this of this predicate factoring predicate with an existential where I'm again being careful to say that in all of these cases is coming from coming from the plaster is one of the positive integer. So without approving any of these claims. I just want you to look at the which one of these are true which one of these which one of these statements are true and keep in mind that you could be looking for Witnesses encounter examples for these done to prove. They're not true.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick and again clicking again.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so I want to show I want to show the answer is here because there is we might be able to get some useful information from around the room because there's some sort of some votes for each of these and then some votes for none of the above. So we ought to be able to find so many people probably have ideas for counter examples for many of these and one of the things that we could do for example to figure out if this is actually none of the above or not is we could find a counterexample or find something that makes any of all of the first one's not true and figure out where we need to do some more sophisticated argument than that if we do.  So this first one folks it said that this was not true any reasons you gave for why it's not true reasons you gave for why it's not true reason to believe it's it's not true.  Why don't you pick pick something other than a  interesting  So let me write it this way. Let me write out what you said in English because often times this is an informal argument.  It can help us get a little bit of intuition. So you're saying there is some.  integer  that is not  it's all not its own factor or doesn't factor with itself or isn't one of its own Factor multiplied by a number to get itself.  Yeah, go ahead.  Pinterest things you're saying look I can always find you some evidence that * 1 that's a successful factoring and seems like it's going to be hard to ever find a number where that's not true. Especially if we're just thinking about positive integers. It seems really pretty clear interesting years. Maybe we can * 1 and we'll use that idea soon for all for all positive integers. It's not true that that integer is its own factor or factors contact herself examples of this is after all so we ought to be able to find a counterexample if it's not true. What's a counterexample for it?  So you're saying look I have I have an example for so you're actually making an argument from the first case you're saying if there doesn't exist something where this is true. It certainly can't be that it's true for all of the elements in the domain write. Another thing we can say is let's just pick a number is 2 a factor of itself to definitely a positive integer and based on our definition. We're asking if you two could be true. So we have to find some see such that 2 is equal to 2 * C or two. I guess I was. On the board. So we have to find some Cetaphil in here. And again, we could use a C equals one is some evidence for that for trying to prove that existential.  How about see how does c relate to and B C relate to a movie or how would you say si in English? Either way helps us answer this in English actually.  Skip practice turn to the person next to you and Stacy to them in English. To say it to me.  Any suggestions for how you want to read CI the way I want to read CD but any suggestions for how you wanted to read see the not before 4. I was a little tough to pronounce sometimes yet.  Who interesting you're saying it's like the same as a like the same as a that's interesting us actually using one of these identities about negating across a quantifier. If we negate across the floor all we can start a push it inside and talk about it being an existential of the negation. So you might say you might say for this one there exists such that not FFA. I mean that's it doesn't quite read that sentence in English, but it's right. You're right that it does. It is equivalent to a how about you read this out in English and describe it what it says.  There does not exist.  What causes static anything interesting? Yes, they're not all true is actually pretty nice summary. So the fur all says for all the staff would have to be true for each one of them has a knot in front and dinner is this predicate holds that's pretty interesting and we can talk about it in similar ways that we talked about.  4D again, we've got another use of one of these negation identities and D is related to beat by one of the negation identities. So none of these in Factor, we can find Arguments for or counter examples for Witnesses for all of them the arguments though. We haven't figured out how to make particularly formal yet.  These arguments like the argument for a where a is an existential and we're trying to show that it's not true. So it's not like we found a witness for a are we made this argument that there is no way we can possibly find this integer. So that's interesting about ways. We can make that argument more formal. And also we were saying while we were building up his understanding of the factoring predicate is really that it seems like the factoring predicate on the same number. So the statement for all AFA is actually true for all the numbers cuz we could always use this factor of Cedar X it and in find find some evidence for it. And so there's this idea of constructing this kind of argument example, are you in this is an argument that proved by choosing an arch proof by choosing arbitrary element.  We're going to call it neat and the only thing we assume about is that it comes from the domain with only the domain we have for that Quantified variable X. The only thing we assume is that it came from and we'll just use that information to show that so in the case of our the statement on the last slide that statement is  the positive form of that statement would be for all a  And being precise about the domain here just so we don't make any mistakes thinking about the domain that is in.  z+  this product should be true statement. We like to we like to show his true.  so we can  assuming arbitrary  e-myth in this domain  and what we want to show is that ffe must be true and all we know about e is that it is  In this domain of positive integers.  And then we have to look what we have to do. Next is we want to show f a v e and we have a definition for f here so we can talk about this using the symbolic form of this definition for f in order to in order to demonstrate that no matter the value of 4 positive integers. We can make ffbe true. So  by the definition  F we know that if we can show there exists  some see  such that we have and now I'm feeling an e-4 both A and B in the predicate just substituting in that value in the symbolic form of the predicate if we can show that there exists such that equals e x c then we will have demonstrated this and so we can find this Witness.  of C equals 1  that's a suggestion that was made earlier as well. We can fix equals one here. If we feel C equals 1 into this equation. Will you can just multiply 80 by 1 and see the equals and that makes the entire existential be true. So we found a witness of the existential is true. We've demonstrated that the existential is true which demonstrates the death of me is true and all we had to know here is that we could do basic arithmetic and algebra of picking C equals 1 in multiplying and all of that works for the values of either positive integers. So this is successfully demonstrated what we wanted to show  I want pop up table that relates to how we have looked at this before with cables because we just read what I just said is we use the definition of f we assume we had an arbitrary Element TV from this domain and positive integers and then we the definition of existential so we had to use a witness to show that existential was true.  Sun turns over the tables we've had so far the claim we were making is that for all a in the positive integers FAA is true and we had this definition of and we can think of this just like the tables we've been drawing where we have the input a counting up one two, three four and for each input there's this statement we have to demonstrate that every single time if we substitute that a value into the definition we can find a witness for it. It happens in this proof that we pics equals one and every single time though witness one works to demonstrate that this is true and we can demonstrate that FAA is true.  the thing the proof does that we weren't we didn't have a way to talk about before is now if I give you some arbitrary row of this table and I say  tell me about the row where a is equal to 547.  The proof tells us how to fill in this entire row. The proof will say well you will need to show this existential your pixie equals one and it'll work out because of how just arithmetic and algebra work on integers. We're going to be able to run this process through and end up with a true over here.  And so the the thing we get out of a proof, so this these statements of a proof.  Is kind of like a way to generate a row of our table for an arbitrary input. So anytime we have some arbitrary input to this for all statement something that's in the positive integers disprove. Tell someone how to generate the next row in a table or the row in the table for that element.  And this is the kind of argument we need to make in order to justify the true side of a for all statement. We really want to justify that aperol statement is true. We have to show how it's going to work for any possible role the table and produce a true net protocol.  So this is called proof by generalization idea. Is there any proof that start by saying we will assume some arbitrary element from the domain and it's a good way to prove for all statements. We basically only get to make assumptions about the domain and we're trying to generate all these rooms.  We need a big new ideas. I want you to take a minute to talk about talk about that idea with the person next to you and come up with any questions. You have any observations you have about that big new idea for a minute questions that you have then we'll do some more examples.  Okay questions observations about this idea of using this arbitrary elements idea to prove this statement the idea that the proof generator over this table questions here.  Yeah.  Waltz of the the key thing here is the thing that lets us do that is  That all we assume about he is that it came from the domain that we picked for the Frosty. And so if we don't make any other assumptions about be like I didn't say this works because he is even or this works because he is a multiple of 7 or something like that. I chose. I didn't make any assumptions are some positive integer. And what happens to work. Well as there is this property that if you multiply 1 by a number that you get that number, right if this property or something else like every number is equal to 2 times itself. We wouldn't be able to we wouldn't be able to demonstrate that still. All I use is that he has some integer. There's As Nice property of integers that if we multiply them by one we know we get that in at your back and if I didn't use any extra information other than it was from the domain, that's the guarantee along with making a logically consistent argument. That's a guarantee. It will always be able to create a row for any element.  Because any element that's in any row of this left-most column for a element in that column is it is something that's the only criteria for appearing in that column. And so we only assume that then that's enough information to push the whole argument.  other questions  Yeah.  not  That's a great question. So in this case in this proof, the witness is always one. Right and that's because in the proof we said the witness that were using evidence is this equals one case we could imagine other proofs of other properties or the witness might depend on the input somehow right? And then maybe this would be different if it would depend on the imagine that for that the witness might be different in cases where like we're trying to prove something is another number divided by two or something. There could be proved the witness call them changes depending on the input.  Yeah.  Right. So that's where we would need to say something. Like I'm trying to think of a simple enough example off the top of my head to demonstrate it.  You might want to say something like for every number there exists a number there exists a negative number right? That might be an interesting thing to talk about as a property and we kind of believe that about the integers intuitively right get a positive numbers is negative. You can add them together and the witness for that existential might be different for every row because for the number of the positive number three, the witness would be -3 for the positive number for the witness will be negative for and so on so that would change but we can calculate the witness call him from the input right before all would be over all the positive integer and then we would calculate and I would have to be a math expression that works on any possible positive integer. Do we know some of those end up working with the particular input?  And we the important thing is that the constructs that when this we only knew that the input was a positive number nothing else about it.  So I could imagine in some witness columns you would want to write to witness columns to think about this one, which is an expression that uses something based on the input in the case of that positive negative times negative one and then you could also think about the time where I could imagine witness Collins with a bunch of Expressions. There is basically what I'm getting up.  Good questions. Good questions.  The key idea here is one way to think about a proof or at least this kind of proof by generalization is you're describing a process to generate an arbitrary row of this table guaranteed to have enough evidence for a true in the rightmost column is in terms of the tables. We've been drawing so far and that's how it lets us extend. These arguments two tables that have that have tables over internet domains where a could really be taken from an Internet domain.  So this is mostly just a reminder of some of the properties that we we saw earlier that we have this relationship between negations of cool.  Sounds good. We have this relationship between negations of universals indications of existential the point in his bottom case if we have a interesting thing to note here is in the bottom case. We have a knot of an existential rewrite 2 for all statement that we need to prove with a general argument. But these are these are identities we were using in the beginning of class to talk about those statements synergist are interesting and useful things to be aware of I want to ask a question related to them. This is really sort of practice working with some of these definitions because they're going to be important when we  Go on to doing proofs that interesting implications and conjunctions in them. So I want you to use these to talk a little bit about some Quantified statements. So logical equivalence of these Quantified statements using these these couple of properties and you have these properties on the back of your feet. So it's not like they were just on the slide in there for a second. You have a slide. Do you have the properties written on the back? So if you want to use those to answer these go for it.  5 4 3 2 1 discuss this and it'll probably last thing we do to discuss this topic in a minute.  Okay clicking again with answers after discussing this.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay. So many people said the day was a was not true. What's a counterexample for a what's a what's some input values that clearly make?  Okay might make a not work. If we thought about different values we could have for p and Q. "
