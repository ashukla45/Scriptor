So today we're going to continue our discussion of sizes of sets is going to be consequences for what we can represent in programs finishing off that argument and that sort of punchline on Friday today. We need a little bit more mechanics and show up as a really interesting argument in proof. That'll tell us something about relating thing is like the natural numbers to the real number. So I will be working on this today and on Friday. I just want to remind you that next Monday is Memorial Day holiday, so we won't have class and the homework is going to be due on Tuesday evening out on Monday evening. So everything is going to ship and then the warm up in the follow-up next week will be due on Friday evening instead of Thursday evening for the whole week to ship sits deadlines by a day because of the holiday, so just be ready for that. Mom, and I know the last homework is going to be do a little later and we can as well paid for that is posted on the on the website. I forget if we pick Tuesday or Wednesday, but it do a little bit later in the week in week 10 as well. So if a little off because of Memorial Day, but everything is being shifted by a day. So it's kind of like you have the same number of days if you want to treat Memorial Day as a holiday, which holidays are let's let's get started for the the thing really been focusing on and he's our definitions are going to work within the homework and the definitions that we've been using for a few days are these ideas of comparing sizes of sets? So we've talked about 1 CET being no bigger than another asset being at least as big as another in two sets having the same cardinality and these have involve writing functions that are either one or both and we've had these symbolic definitions of these three properties really what we're going to be working with more today. I will be talking about it on Friday as well.  Answer one question. I want to start with is this question of do all sets have the same size one of the things seem to be happening on Monday 8 on Monday we talked about how the size of the natural numbers is the same as the size of all the pairs of natural numbers. The size of the natural numbers is the same as the size of the integers the size of the natural numbers is the same as the size of all the linked lists of natural numbers a Monday just seemed to say it one question. I want to start with is what can we actually say about sizes of sex. Is it going to be the case that just every set we ever talk about has the same size and we're going to approve some statement like that. Is there actually some distinction here. So I want to know what sort of refined answers to this question is for reasons for no and maybe it's true that they're all the same size.  Have you discussed this is an interesting discussion to have here.  Queso 5 4 3 2 1 and before I say this this very provocative statement. I want to make sure I'm right. Yeah only one of these is correct. This is not a case where it's like a trick question or two right answer. So only one of these only one of these is correct, so I just got  Okay Quicken again Quicken again.  alright 5 4 3 2 1  So for this first one for a I want to remind us of one of the definition so we had in the last line, which is actually all three of the top definitions on the last slider relevant here. The structure of these symbolic definitions is actually pretty important for understanding. What a is saying the statement in a is that we're trying to show that these two  These two sets have different sizes. So it's not the case that they have the same size. So we take the symbolic form of equality. Let's just pick that one. There's a couple ways we can talk about this could we have this we have this nice theorem, which means we could use different different ones of these properties to talk about this because there's this if and only if going on a property the direct one that would directly show equals and that property would be there exists a function from A to B.  I'm in and for all and let me just fill in assets and I'm not going to write down the whole property. I just want to get it started. So a would be 1 2 3 and b would be a t g c.  And then we have that for all little B exists and a and so on in that property for equality. That's just copying down the definition of the that's having the same size as having the same cardinality and then we have a not so we're actually trying to prove not exists that we're trying to prove not a quality means there exists a function. So we put this this not in the front here. And so that's that negation right there would be trying to justify would be there does not exist function from 12328 e g c such that exist.  And this argument says that this is a different argument than that this statement here says consider this one. It says consider this function f so, it's like it found a witness so I can pick one F and says given by this time since it's not on to it is a counterexample the problem with this is that this is saying there exists an F.  And it has the same type the type is all right.  Sites that not for all the existing a right it negated.  The body of this onto was part of what's going on in the body of that up there.  But that's not logically equivalent to not exist. We catch has moved and not inside the exists and decide that we're done. It's not logically equivalent to just take a note from outside in Augusta. Move it inside the logically equivalent statements and not exist would be rather.  For all functions that have to not be one-to-one or not. Be on to it for all possible functions from 1232 atgc give this justification. He says there's some function that's not on to between these two sets on to between two sets. Its we can certainly can stop them pretty easily by picking single values in the output set things like that. Lots of ways to construct functions that don't work and what we we need to show to show that they have different sizes is that there can't exist a function that works there or their can't exist a function is one-to-one in both directions. Nothing much different property anything one function doesn't work. So this is a mistake. We sometimes see and homeworks to where there is like a not exist to prove and people pick a witness say it doesn't work for that witness and say they're Justified the not exist.  But in all possible elements in that set the property is false.  The second one here five nights at my have different sizes, but all infinite sets have the same size is a tantalizing argument. It's a very sounds like man. Yeah, that's true. Especially based on what we saw on Monday and this is the big question for today.  Is basically is this true or not is it the case is a bunch of finite sets that might have different sizes. We can like count right in roster notation. We can kind of see that one two, three has a different size than a t g c a question for today. One thing that I want to find out about see is that we showed that this could work that we could have a Cartesian product with itself be the same could have a set be the same size as a Cartesian product with a product with itself. We showed that the size of the naturals was equal to the size of the naturals.  Cartesian product with a Naturals and we had this idea of doing doing that exponents with this. So we did this was the one where we did what we had a pair X Y we would talk about doing to the bx32 the Y and it was an argument based on prime factorization that that would be a unique number that was on Mondays at least show the disc in Workforce works for the natural so she can't be true. And so this definitely is not the case. The naturals do have the same size as the Cartesian product of the naturals.  And we're actually going to answer this will give us the answer to be.  And I'm not going to tell you what the answer is until we we look at it but this operation of taking a set and talking about the relationship between the size of asset and the size of death has power set turned out to be really interesting thing to look at someone you to take him and I think feel like there was a lot happening in just these four answers to take a minute to think about these questions or comments on what we discussed to justify these answer is in the question.  All right questions questions questions about anything we discussed here to get through these fees for options.  everybody's happy  When is happy?  Smile and in and look happy if you're happy.  lots of people doing this  All right, so I'm just a couple of terminology definitions and a picture to think about some of the things we've said.  That we use the term finite sets a lot in this class. That means we have a finite set means we can write it out in roster notation, even though take a long time. We could write it out and roster notation or is equal to the size of some fixed number of natural numbers. So from 1 to some fixed and we can talk about it being the same size as that set. And then we are going to use this term of countably infinite stats when we can take a sentence shows the same size as the natural numbers of the same size as the positive integers and the picture is here at the bottom are just showing us some ways that different sets that we've seen the integers the Cartesian product of natural and the positive rational actually a bijection with just the naturals. So we saw this idea by doing this multiplication and subtracting subtracting one that we could put the integer.  The integers in order so that each one corresponds to some natural number. So that was the multiplying by negative 2 and subtracting one made it. So the negative integers would produce odd natural numbers and positive integers would produce even natural numbers and there's this little picture here for showing how to sort of map out a way to put all of the  pairs of natural numbers to these arrows are drawing between  dots on the coordinate plane  and he's not on the coordinate plane is some pair of natural numbers sort of map out this way to go through them in order. And anytime we can serve go through this set of values in a particular order we can talk about this is the first one we visit the second one. We visit the third one we visit and so on and that also gives us a way to talk about the naturals in the picture here for the rational shows. We can sort of specific order pictures that demonstrate some of the stuff. We already talked about on Monday that we do have this relationship between these steps in the natural numbers. It's not a proof. It's a bit sort of a picture representation that the the same thing is happening and then sometimes pictures or give veteran tuition and many more believable from a high-level then seeing the details. So you seen a lot of town so far have been countably infinite.  and  Ideas, are there any sets that exist that aren't finite and aren't accountable meaning they don't have the same size as a natural numbers. They have some other size may be a bigger size than the size of a natural numbers that would tell us what's going on with with whether there are sets with different sizes or not better both size. And this be the sort of interesting things that we be able to say if that were true. Like there are different sizes of Infinities and there's some examples in the train work at 4.  So let's talk about the natural numbers in the power set of natural numbers. What are the options on that? First question was talking about a set and that's a power set and relating their sizes. So let's make sure we understand what I'm power set of natural numbers looks like so which of these ABCD are elements of the power set of natural numbers natural numbers.  Five four three two, one of the questions we need to ask for each of these is if they are a subset of an ISO the powers that is all of the subsets of these we can think of the question we're asking as is this a subset of the natural numbers. Is this a subset of the natural numbers subsets?  Subset and someone and all of these are true of the empty set a subset of all sets the zeros of subsets. This is interesting. This is all of the numbers that are natural numbers that aren't equal to 0 mothers that we know about it.  3 + vs B+ and B+ is also a subset of the natural numbers. So the only one here that's not true because there's sort of a there's a type error here is a zero is not a subset of the phone numbers. It's an element of the natural numbers. That doesn't work here b c and d are all  so just a reminder cuz we're going to thinking about this power set idea a bunch in the next few slides want to make sure we're on the same page about that definition.  So the central question that we're going to be asking about here is in this property that's on this like it's at one half of this witches.  Where we were kind of curious are the sizes of these two sets the same. That's the that's the question. We'd like to be able to answer to answer this original question. We started with one maybe Wonder maybe there's one direction of this that can be a little easier to show than the other cuz if we can show that the set of natural numbers is no Bigger Than This One Direction of the show and we can work on the other direction. I'm so which of these is a good witness for this property that the set of natural numbers is no bigger than its power set these demonstrates that  5 4 3 2 1 the answer is here. So, let's see.  I think this is another one where it's worth just pointing out one particular issue actually just really quick for like 10 20 seconds. I'm going to open it up right away, but disgusting at the same time. I think you all noticed one thing that you can switch.  Oh cool Microsoft auto-update. Answer f  Take 10 more seconds.  5 4 3 2 1  someone give me a reason why a does or does not work or it why a does or does not work?  justification one way or another for a  for a  yeah, go ahead.  X is not a set X is a natural number. So you're saying there's a mismatch between this part and the state of total made. This is just not a well-defined function based on what we said its domain should be the value of its produce needs to be set for its codomain to be the power set her not work. So I'm going to talk about B.  satisfyer not satisfy this  what are we looking for? What is a witness have to do in order to justify this direction? What is the function of to do to be a witness for this property?  What's the property?  Property do we need?  F must be what  play louder someone his phone just said something. So we're looking for after b121 which means that it should produce a different output for every natural number so we can ask if FB produces a different output for every possible natural number that we input not going to do a proof of this but it's what we need to be thinking about in order to justify this one way or another it's useful to think about a couple of the outputs for FB to see if this is  Might be true or not.  So let's think about some natural number so40 the output of FB is just the set 0 to the union and the set containing zero with set containing 041 if the set containing 0 1 1 4 2 at the set containing 0 into  and so on this without doing a formal proof really looks like it's 1 2 1 we're never going to have two steps in the output that are equal when we had different in what will always have distinct numbers similar to what we said when we were going from natural numbers to Cartesian products and natural numbers related exactly the same thing.  What's up? So be it works here. What about X and F C of X. What is this table? Look like for zero. What do we get? This is elements of the natural numbers where the elements aren't equal to the exit. We input elements of the art of the natural numbers aren't equal to the exit. We gave his input to this function interesting. So I'm leaving an intentional blank here.  This doesn't contain 0 contains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up, but it doesn't contain 0.  Is all the natural numbers other than one?  This one is all the unnatural numbers other than 2.  We can see here also that we're going to have a different set every time cuz it won't contain that specific number that we gave him. So this is also a one-to-one function. This also works as a one-to-one function from the power set of natural numbers. Now we can think about the other direction the power set of natural numbers being  The being no bigger than the set of natural numbers if we can find a witness for this voice. You can probably in the amount of time left in pi tell whether that's true or not, but let's think about these options.  And if you're thinking none of the above while you have a couple seconds left think of what examples would don't work for the one for all of ab&c or if you think one of a b and c works then what what are the reasons the others don't?  5 4 3 2 1  So sheer if we're trying to show them these are our Witnesses, right? We're looking for them to be one to one again. So we for each of them if we can find some case where two different inputs produces the same output will have Justified that it's not one to one and we can just started as a potential witness and move on to thinking about others. So in the first case for G of a RGA the input cities remember are going to be sets so we have if we give the empty set is input then this is equal to zero.  If we give other sets is input.  Macbeth that's equal to one. But all of these other sets are going to be also equal to one output is 20 and C is a little bit interesting because we have to try to sets that aren't just one element which is kind of interesting. But once we get to two sets that have two elements will quickly see that we have multiple multiple zeros here. So this can't be one to one that demonstrates the same outfit.  Samantha Harris. None of these work and that might make us want to say that the power set of Naturals is uncountable point, but maybe maybe it really is and maybe we can justify this maybe we can say that this really isn't true and there's some proof we can do. That'll get us there.  It's worth thinking about what this is going to mean and we we talked about this on the first slide, like what it would mean for two sets to not be equal. Right really the statement. We're trying to show here.  is that  This dis equality.  Which means symbolically and I'm going to do something as I set up this proof that I think is kind of useful. I'm going to stay in English for a little bit because writing out the symbolic properties on the first slide over and over again as we manipulate the to show it's just really error-prone. There's lots of symbols to write so I want to stay in English for a little bit as we talked about this.  But I want to use a little bit of symbols. We said that this is going to be there does not exist an F from the naturals to the power set of Naturals where f is a bijection so it's both one-to-one and onto  so we're trying to show that that's not true. Is it that's what I'm saying in English in the body of the predicate. I didn't want to write out that large symbolic thing was that largest in Vale thing is saying is action. And so that's what you show by definition and then are too shy to show we could have by logical equivalences that every function  from the naturals to the power set of Naturals  is not a bijection.  Silver any arbitrary function from the natural set up our side of Naturals. It can't possibly be a bijection. That's what our goal would be one way to stay cool.  Annapolis that's what set up in this to show you some of the scaffolding of the proof on your hand out as well. But that's function of silver picking up by Universal generalization. That's all we know about it. And so we have to think about what we're going to do the proof by contradiction here, which is going to lead us an interesting Direction and we have to pick we're going to choose for both the property were negating while that's going to be related to this goal. And then we have to pick what are we're going to show his true and not true for thinking about what property are going to show his true and not true.  Can help think about pee at the same time related.  ideas  Where's the properties of available? What are some properties of functions that we could try to State? What do we what properties can we State about functions?  We know like three of them.  What are the properties of functions we've tried to we've stated so far and proved and talked about?  FTB  When the wine could be could be okay. It's so we're going to assume that f is a bijection cuz that's the negation of the property were looking at were looking at not as a bijection and episode. My Jackson is nice. It tells us that f is one-to-one and it's on to  so if we pick either f is one-to-one or F is onto for are we already get like half of it right? We're going to be trying to prove our and not our and the our part would be implied by f is a bijection. So then we just have to show the not part of that statement. So I want to say that one thing you're mine for jump to hear when thinking about these ours is there's this app. We just picked it by Universal generalization. What are properties we know about functions, maybe one of them to pee when really it is just as property were trying to the negation of this property were trying to show  So candidates would be f is one-to-one and F is onto this is similar to prove by contradiction. This is similar to something when we do numbers when we do proof by contradiction with numbers it often is that we want to choose a property related to numbers like they have a factor in a certain way or they're even or odd because our assumptions are going to tell us something about the structure of the number to look at what kind of object you're proving things about and think about what properties are able to stay. Those are going to be good candidate this case we're going to choose f is onto  We're going to assume f is a bijection so is one to one and onto and we're going to show our is on too and not onto.  So the next step in his proof is going to be assumed.  F is a bijection.  And to show is that f is onto.  and F is not  on Two and a Jackson is logically equivalent to F is one-to-one and  F is onto which justifies let's show that f is not on.  I mean, that's true. I let you go. The f is not onto.  So the two shall we have is that f is not.  And now it's useful to get symbolic statement. We're trying to get out here and that's the that's the sort of The Next Step that you're shown in the proof here at this though the just looking at your hand out. This says rewriting use the definition of the to show is and that's the this is saying it's not the case that for all be and those bees are going to be stats of natural numbers.  because their elements of the power set  there's some natural number a  such that F of a equal to this set B. I'm just using lowercase and capital letters to lowercase letters are going to be for specific numbers to capital letters are going to be so that's right. That's to show and that's just by the definition of onto.  No, this is not for all which means that we're going to end up trying to find a witness for be here. This turns into there exists some set B that the set of natural numbers.  Such that for all eggs. I'm doing both negations here.  FFA isn't equal to be so we're trying to find some set of natural numbers.  So that for all natural numbers that can't possibly be the case the FFA is equal to that number.  I want to talk about the witness we could choose here.  Because there's like a two pieces of insight in this proof that really come up and one is picking this like a lot of what we've done right now is strategizing which is it's it's it's own kind of insight that we were going to pick this order to do things in but the actual proof once we've set this up to get the contradiction place and then start doing the work has two pieces where I think there's really Insight one is in choosing this witness and then the other end up happening a little bit later when we talked about set equality here cuz that's going to end up being a question about the definition of set equality since the result of that. Jose is a set and B is also set so there's two places. Where will you and I wanted to say a little bit about what happens if we pick some witnesses. There's a witness on your sheet that you can look at it. We will be able to push through and talk about why  Why that matters I want to just pick a witness that doesn't work because when I do this proof enough to develop proof do in class, I don't always know exactly what their next step is to try some wacky stuff when I was writing this proof and it's like it's one of these proofs where we're trying to prove something kind of strange and so maybe a little thing and just in cases like the empty set are good to try by picking the empty set right saying for all in the naturals.  Alphabay can't be equal to the empty set.  So we pick an arbitrary element after they can't be faulted empty set would be our new to show.  How can we can we make any progress? Why can we make progress or not? Make progress towards this goal. What would what would you do if I would you know, if you can make more progress or not? What about that tells you there's some more progress to make here. I need to go back and try something else.  I thought it tells you.  So you're saying if there's one element of a that equal to the empty set then we'd have some problem with one to one it wrong to another other way of getting stuck and get where we're getting stuck here.  So you're saying it seems like since we have said we don't we know so little about F that it's hard to say that it couldn't do this and it doesn't seem like if it produced empty sets. It would be a good help us get to our contradiction at all other ways, you know you get stuck stuck.  I guess the thing I think there's like this cause it's related to both things are folks said which is why we really don't know much about F right now could be a lot of different functions right Evans an arbitrary function, which is a pretty interesting object to think about any function that takes natural numbers and produces sets of natural numbers is nothing special about F that talks about the empty set single particular Taste of this is false. We don't have enough evidence in the proof so far to talk about this relationship between the behavior that there's no assumption above it says anything about the empty said they would help us here or says anything about the output of not having elements that could help us here.  It's related to this claim was ends up being an unhelpful claim and we can try similar things with other sets right other particular set and it turns out that we end up with these sort of these claims. It seemed like maybe they're true. Maybe they're not we don't have the right kind of evidence for them. So one of the one of the ideas here is that if we think about where we're going to go forward in this proof, we're going to pick some witness. I'm going to call Dee it's going to end up being the D that's on your shape. But on the on the slide, I'm just going to write the next step of the proof assuming we have some good witness and we'll talk about the witness. But what's happening what I want to show happening here is what we might do in the proof.  Next that would justify picking some particular witness. We're trying to make it so that no matter what a we pick it turns out that the sets are equal.  And we need to pick a d that we can fill in there at Sunset di that's going to be a set of natural numbers so we can fill in there that makes that never be the case and the the insights hero is almost time.  It it feels like cheating. When when we write this down the ideas. Well, okay, let's pick us that where we just can't we can't have the input in the output set and maybe that'll work really. Well. Let's let's just try and build the kind of thing. We need on the right hand side here.  So the deal we've defined is going to be the set of all X in the natural numbers cuz we know D needs to be a subset of natural numbers.  And we're going to say well, it's all the ones where it's not.  in the  it turns out this little this this little predicate here that X is not in its own output when given to F sort of fits in and exactly the right way when we do the subset definition or when we do this at equality definition.  so we can  So ASM arbitrary number we want to show that.  FFA is not equal to this set be  and then we can talk about set equality.  And what is that equality say, it says it's not the case that for all X and in this case were talking about sets of natural numbers.  Taxes in half of a if and only if x is in this witness we chose in D.  But a lot of little logical equivalence there exists an X with a net is going to have to be a natural number so that X is in half of a X or X is in D.  So we needed to be that we can find some witness that we can find some number that is either in FFA or in this Saturday that we made. We need to find some number without going to work in. This is the other the other place where we need a little bit of insight in this proof. It is essential.  Any ideas for what? We should choose for?  For the witness here that might be interesting for you to think about the witness.  What values do we know about in this proof?  Like what names have we Define? We said like a Sumer choose or let somewhere in the proof? What do we know about that would be interesting to think about here. We we have a sense that those might not work values.  Values when did to show f is onto f is not onto did we to find any values? Yes or no?  What we did the first life f is onto and if is not onto did we Define any names? We say choose let it we can find any names.  No second line f is not on to be divinely names.  No, third line. Do we Define any names?  Any new names when you say it like that choose a witness to be up to pick a witness or anything there. We just rewrote e names.  Remind me to find any names to get from the 4th to the 5th line.  Define D6 lion do we Define any names? We do finally names here.  Are we to find a there is some natural number that we know about in the proof and it's a is going to be interesting. It might be related to all of these different things that are going on in the structure of the proof for trying to pick a witness here and we need a natural number where we going to pick 1:01 to what we actually have some natural number that's related to what we're defining here. So that is another moment. We're in a proof. You need to pick a witness. You need to pick a counterexample look for the stuff that's to find somewhere in the proof because those values are going to be related to the properties you're talking about. So it turns out a value that works really well here is to choose a  as a witness  if we do that we end up with.  either a is in a Fab a xor  hey is in the set X such that X is not in.  its own output on Earth  What is that mean? So for a to be in Miss set, that means a has to not be in its own output.  on F  which "
