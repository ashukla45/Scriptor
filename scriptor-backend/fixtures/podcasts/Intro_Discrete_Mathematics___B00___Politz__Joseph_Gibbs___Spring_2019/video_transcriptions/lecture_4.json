    "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started. There we go.  I got to see you all again. Cuz I forgot to tell you last Monday that I was going to be out for the rest of the week. Sorry for the surprise. I was presenting some work and just gone for 2 days. So although I don't have any other travel plan this quarter, so I'll probably be here every lecture for the rest of the quarter on or where you left off on Friday and what we've been talking about. What we started talking about on Friday is different ways to represent numbers and we talked about this idea of doing base expansion and representing numbers in different bases base 10 being the most space to being the one that computers use quite a bit, but I understand many different bases.  So today we're going to talk about some more ways of representing integers and in fact, we're going to talk about representing non integer numbers to and the way they talk about today or going to specifically a form some of how this happens inside a computer and one thing I wanted to mention if there's there's two kinds of office hours for this course, I just wanted to put this out there and there was a post information on the website and his assignments go out how to get help in various ways, but the two kinds of office hours so so they'll just be scheduled on the calendar. You can come by whenever you want multiple students can come in and ask questions and we're just there in a few days are there in the Tudors are there to answer questions if you want some kind of specific help maybe you didn't understand the question on the homework and you want to go over that you can schedule information.  As the as the course progresses, but I wanted to be clear that there's these two kinds of office hours we have for the course and the ones you see schedule on the calendar are necessarily the only ways to to get home.  Any questions either from last week or that you want to ask before we before we dive in for the day since you haven't seen me in a week and questions you have.  Yeah.  Programming languages and compilers Conference. So I met some people I haven't met before build compilers that are like the thing that makes JavaScript browser. I'm so fun to talk to them just take a second. And what I want you to do is think about what the base expansion based on the definition. We did last week not using anything but I just paid them what we did last week. What's the base 2 expansion of 20 in base 10?  I'm not going to spend a lot of time. I just want to make sure you you start the problem on your own before I draw it.  the number 20 in base 10 converted to base 2 and base 10 converted to base 2  Play some people holding up fingers in specific patterns indicating what they think it is a sprig rate as a refresher might be different than what you saw last week. So I might one way I might do this and sort of high-level way. I might do this if I know I have a number like 20 where I can where I just sort of until he's lights a little better for you where I can sort of tell that 28. Well, it's 16 + 4 which are both powers of 2, and so maybe I can start thinking about the ones place the to his place before his place States place and so on in the base to representation if I want to do it in a more structured way sort of step-by-step talked about last week where we do repeated division the base and keeping track of the remainder so we can think about this is the first time we divide 20 by to we get 10  Then we can divide by 2 again. We get five with a 0 remainder. We can divide by 2 again we get to with a 1 remainder when divided that by to we get one with a zero remainder when divided by 220 with a 1 remainder and then these digits are zeros and ones in the increasing position order. The coefficients we should use for the base 2 expansion easy rose and then are the coefficients in the face 2 0 0 1 0 1 and if we Mark what the places are some of the values of these different positions are this is the one that has placed before is the eighth's in the 61 * 16 + 1 * 420  Changing is representation a little bit to represent computer.  They make any mistakes mistakes.  Okay, so I want to go on talking about this definition. That's at the top of the worksheet now.  When I did this just now for you and maybe what you did on your worksheet when you did it is you just used as many as many coefficients as you needed to and stop when you got to the 16th place cuz there's a 1 in the most significant place. In fact, the definition from last week said that you couldn't have a zero as the first digit in order in one of these representations part of the definition for last week and we ended up with five coefficients because that's how many coefficients we needed to represent 16. We had to go to the 16th Place and that's just how computers work a little differently than this computers 10 to store fixed sized representations of values and numbers.  Computers are going to use the same amount of space to store a number like one as they would just or a number like a billion. They won't use a different number of bits to store those two numbers and watching over a few details here, but for the common case of representing integers that are in the range of billions and below is true sight a computer. We often talked about a fixed with representation of numbers as many coefficients as we need always with a 1 in the most significant place. We fix some size. We say we're going to represent all the numbers we can with 8011 coefficients or 16011 coefficients or 32mm. Number of coefficients are going to and not I will represent numbers on the front of your worksheet says we are going to be expansions of numbers.  We pick a fixed with upfront as part of the definition and then say that we're going to represent numbers with that many digits always.  As a as a question for you what I want to ask you instead of just representing 20 base ten with as many digits as we need. We might try to fix dip with for the number of number of coefficients. We used to represent which of these work which of these work.  So which of these are possible for writing the number 20?  I'm asking you this one could see.  What seed is looking at answers coming in? I want to feel free to discuss this as your as you're working on it right now.  Okay 5 4 3 2 1.  Okay, so we saw in the last lie, when I do doubt that we needed at least five digits to represent plenty. We needed that 16th Place to represent 20. We can always add more leading zeros and get something that represents the same number. So A and B both have enough patience to represent 20 both have enough binary coefficients represent what we needed at least but I see doesn't work.  Just got interesting. That means we're a little bit limited depending on what width we pick and what numbers can be represented here.  The one question I have for you is that we just expressed some kind of I just expressed some kind of a constraint that there's going to be some numbers we can't represent here. So take a minute. I want you to talk about what constraint ought to go in that blank to capture this idea that I just said about not being able to represent some numbers. Once we've chosen with what constraints constraints on and make sense here to capture that constraint.  Feel free to talk about it.  I'm just going to let people talk for about 10 10 15 seconds.  All right, there was some hand so go ahead with suggestions. You've both raise your hand.  Maybe that's something to do with the log or something to do with an exponent. I'll call you in a second.  Beer the power W. So inverse of a logarithm that using exponents.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so this should be e to the power w.  What's the time?  I think they let me say when you come back to log in just a second.  We don't want to the W Express is a 10 ought to be less than b to the W right. So let me say this but instead say and is less than b let me come back to this. We might be able to express the rate. We might be able to say something like really Express with the upper bound on an is without without resorting to these are all integers. So it's very sort of crisps to express and is less than what's going on, but this is a nice way to express  This constrains us once we fixed a with W. We're only going to be able to represent numbers that are in the 6th would represent. Those are the numbers that were going to be able to fit in.  Consequences for us when we think about programming because it means that once we picked a fixed with representation. We can't actually represent all the numbers we might want to represent. It's a limitation for another question. I have we entered is binary as the special case with base to on Friday. And now we introduce fixed with binary leaving with unconstrained so we can pick width represents a really big numbers if we want to are there any numbers that can be represented by a regular binario beats on Friday on Friday any numbers that can be represented by fixed with that can't be represented on Friday and asked you to answer this on your own first discussion about it.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick in again with the results of thinking about it. Think about this and talking about it.  5 4 3 2 1  okay, just don't want to give their answer and a little bit of reasoning for why they picked answer they did.  Yeah, so there's going to be a lot of numbers we want to talk about that can't be represented by either of these representation so far. We can't represent represent the number one half for example, right. Neither of these representation can give us one half but the questions asking something a little bit different. Let me just make sure I restate the question we're looking for something that can be represented in binary in regular binary.  Interesting interesting. So let me lyrics find us some more by binary and fixed with binary what I mean is the definition from Friday with beef stew and a definition from today with base to and anyway, and so neither of those can represent zero and one of the difference between these definition what I mean is base expansion from Friday and 6 with base expansion for today.  Interesting. Tell them anything again right now in the definition of fixed with binary and binary from Friday. We can't represent negative numbers. We can't represent 1/2 so we can't represent those numbers and either one without an extension. Yeah.  103 thing in fixed with we can represent zero and in what we learned on Friday, we can't represent zero and there's it. It has to do with the fixedness and you're not allowed to just write 0 in what we learn on Friday other answers other answers.  Yeah, that's really interesting. So we need to pull it that would mean that we need to pull up the definition from Friday, which is really interesting because I don't think I have the PDF open on my computer right now. Let's see if it's in my recent files perfect. And so we can zoom in on this definition and there we go. Okay. So this is from Roseanne zeros are constrained by Leading zeros in here.  Really good question, right?  Yeah.  Wussow sheer down here. We have this constraint is not that kind of thing. I want the most significant digits of the most significant coefficient is a k - 1 and it says that the most significant coefficient cannot be zero. So in fact the meaning right if we go back to the definition of put a number that has a leading zero that's an instance of this definition. We actually can't represent something with a 0-0. We can't represent something that's just all heroes. In fact, we can't do that. So the definition from Friday doesn't admit zero definition for fixed with does a zero at least one number that can be represented by fixed on Friday.  Are there any more are there any others other than zero that could be represented by 6 from Friday?  Interesting to think about like how would you argue one way or another here, but I can't think of a counterexample right now. So it must be true.  How do you are you one way or another about that?  so one argument I make  So we'll talk about strategies over the course of the quarter what you're describing sounds similar to want to dive into in today's lecture, but that's not the direction we could going I'm going to make him more high-level argument doesn't have represented in binary from Friday.  Then we have a number that has a bunch of coefficients in it and it has some weed K because we already have the number represented in binary which means it has some with K. And as long as there's no other constraints imposed by 6 with on that then we'll be able to represent those numbers from binary and fix with constraints. There are binary from Friday and constraints on 6 with binary that we had today and I'm not going to talk about this in Sons of in all but this is really the only extra constraint. This is a constraint we dropped is enforcing that there's no leading zero we drop that constraint and out of this idea of with there's really only one number that we got out of this now we can represent zero with this with  Argument for this sort of telling you this because I don't want to get into approve strategies we need right now.  It's a really interesting question. So the question is why why did we have this constraint that we didn't want leading leading zero?  It's not necessary to represent the number so it seems like extra information. So that's one answer other other reasons why that might be good to constrain. Yeah go for I'm just going to go to you first.  Sorex transformation arguments a the space we can talk about saving space on the page or saving space in our brains when we're thinking about it right couple different kinds of space. Yes.  Another argument you're saying is if we are disallowed leading zeros, then there's only one way to represent each number interesting to think about if that's true, right if that constraint is enough, but that could be a motivation making sure there's not multiple ways to represent the same number.  Interesting. So you're saying without that constraint we give infinite leading zero. So since the definition forces us to talk about some K. That's some some positive integer K. We're sort of forced to commit to a cell number that's actually an integer because we can we can we are forced into definition to choose some integer the really neat idea and you're right that both of these definitions have this idea that you could I keep stacking things out in front to get more things larger number.  Do the force algorithm terminate depends on the algorithm? I think it would be hard to say without looking at a specific algorithm. So because if it depended on the leading zeros in some way maybe but it would depend on the algorithm. The uniqueness is is probably the main motivation we have to we can only speculate on someone else's goals for giving us a definition why they put constraints on it, but you need me as a representation of zeros in front of them and in base ten, they're sort of exactly one way that we typically write each number in base ten. It doesn't have any leading zeros and things like that. It opens up to the representing more numbers and makes it clear that zero is something we want to accommodate representation.  Just Energy and start talking about representation of  actually, what's  what's take one?  You look at the worksheet for a second. I just want to take one second and I can have you feel this all in I just want you to someone to tell me what we would what should be filled in for these three boxes. And what's going to be different about them before before I go on so just just hands what's going to be different about the first box where it says with 10 in the second box where it says would 7 tell me what just tell me the difference between those so we all know what it should be before we going.  So both of these are going to phone number to Leading zeros and in the box with with and there's going to be more leading zeros, right? These are going to have to use the 520 and then the one with zeros.  Connect I want to talk about representing numbers that aren't just integers. I'm so bunch of you seem to even be starting to suggest some ideas for numbers that aren't just integers 4 numbers that could be talked about the negative integers, which we haven't represented yet. Also, there is these these real numbers between represent fractional values and so are non whole value we have to do with with w and one refers to a bunch of exponents and coefficients the number of coefficients before a decimal point and another refers to the number of coefficient after a decimal point and so it can be a little bit tricky to spot in this representation. Cuz the. Hiding here's all the stuff that's before the. And here's all the stuff it after the  Phila. Is in between the A's in the seas.  And so what is this represent? What is this representation saying so it's not necessarily just any number of digits that we want. So we're staying in this domain of being fixed in the number of digits were going to use to represent things and what it's saying is the approximation we build up the approximation. We build up looks very similar for the first half. So this part  Looks just like what we had four fixed with a whole number representation, but then there's a part where we start using these other indices the coefficients C coefficients and we start using negative negative exponents.  just saying  Genesis 2 blanks these two blanks. The first blank is similar to the the blank that we had for representing things in fixed with expansions for whole numbers. So that should be something that tells us how big could possibly be with this representation because we're going to be constrained in what numbers we can represent here. And then there's an interesting funniness in this definition compared to what we had before instead of writing equals between X and this big some right before we were equals and it has a big sum or writing here is X greater than or equal to this big sum greater than or equal to this big some interesting. I want you to just talk about this definition for a second maybe 30 seconds questions you have about it so far. We're going to use it to do some specific things.  How apply it so what questions do you have about this definition of before we go on?  Jessica Tarlov  alright, so  what are some questions you came up with by looking at this definition?  So you're saying you're saying something about this greater than equals means There's a constraint in some direction approximating this number.  Centris think so your comment. Let's say we had something like you said 8.3 and we could imagine adding a digit here right to look for used to and what it might mean under this under the situation you're saying adding another digit here can never take away. I can never make a number smaller zero there and keep it to me being the same representing the same number 1 2 3 in would be larger, but there's something about adding more digits not making it any smaller. That's interesting.  Stouffville observation I want to just look at what you said it, right? So nothing sample 8.31 decimal digit that were using and there's no possible way. We can represent 8.3 to hear and something about this representation seems to be choosing that we're going to under approximately over approximately going to choose an approximation. That's below an approximation From Below. It's always smaller if we increase the with other questions or observations about this about this definition.  definition  whew interesting all the sea terms if you add them together should be less than one that's enough. That's an interesting observation. We can never take the stuff after a decimal point in a base 10 number and talk about that being larger than one being after the decimal. Is that something less than one observation? So the seas are going to have that property another hand.  represent represent  Yeah, so there's been questions about what numbers we can and can't represent. There's a way we can get we could spend almost too much time on like cool numbers that are hard to represent. But I want to make the point that fix witness makes it so there's a whole bunch we can't represent once we fix up with because we're going to run into some challenges there.  all the way to  interesting. So yeah, so tell me that but you said you picked W is equal to 2.  W Prime equals to 0  Why why I think you mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, so let me make a couple comments here. So just just so imprecise with the definition. We're not big basin definition. We're not allowed to take zero cuz it says the W&W prime or positive integers less it take this when we could also pick that C1 is equal to either 1 or 0 0 we get something like three fits this definition spring would help with that appear in this blank. What constraint would help up here?  Similar to the constraint from our other fixed with representation if we fix this with, how big can the number get. How big can the number get?  We fix W&W Prime.  VW Beetle like this not bigger. It's like that's like the same thing as we had in the last definition. Yeah.  maybe the W + 1  access less than b to the W that sounds like the N is less than the last one but we have this extra comment that was already made. This interesting observation is the sum of all of those see coefficients times B to the beat of the exponent won't be more than one. So this might get us in between that last gasp. We had before 1 below we won't be able to get the issue you pointed out we're not just to be able to say like 4 5 6 7  What's up?  So maybe we can say it at state of the something related to sea is going to be a limit here. I'm wary of CW Prime cuz that sounds like it could actually be kind of a somewhat larger number you could be like positive coefficients and anything else we could make it a little more precise by saying something about W Prime know what we mean by this constraint here. We need medicine straight here. So that makes it more specific with 2 in fractional part with 8. Let's talk about 3 representing 3.75% of 0.1.  Time to work on 3.750 .1 work on both of these for a minute and I will do them together up here if you want to go around and answer any questions.  All right. So let's talk about these together for a minute. I'm in the 0.11 interesting when we start trying to figure out what to put in. So we have the with the end of your part in the decimal part to consider similar rules to what we've done before so we need in the ones place to add up to 3. So one one is going to be the part of this or the whole number part of this reciprocals of two of powers of 2, we want to add up to get to this number just like we have the ones place in the tooth place. What we start to have here is the 1/2 place in the 1/4 place in the 1/8 place. That's what those negative exponents. Give us. The thing that works is we can get there exactly by adding together a half and a quarter.  exactly 2 .75  definition Vista prompt on the worksheet says a fractional part with 8 fractional part with ink and sew in the fractional definitions.  The zeros that are trailing are the ones that don't add any meaning or any extra information to the number where at in zeros that are leading are the ones that don't have any information.  What kind of the nominative depends on the basic at music?  So this is 2 to the zero two to the one to the negative 1/2 to the negative 2 to the negative 3 and that'll typically be the thing right before the point.  What happens if we shift the decimal around? I'm not going to answer that directly multiplying thing. So where we know that we have zero before the decimal point surf again two numbers in 1/8 numbers after the decimal point one way to start thinking about this is real number where represent a larger than the approximation we come up with that real number to be larger than the approximation to come up with. So should we add a house?  Should we add a half if we want the real number? We're representing to be larger than this approximation.  If we put one here, then the number that we are not represent. The number that we end up representing here is going to be at least 1/2 then following digits can only add more to this. So we shouldn't use a one here because we already be larger and part of what we're trying to do is end up under approximating a number so we can talk about it worth again. We shouldn't use the force because then we'd over approximate. The number right now would be .25 that's already larger than point one.  One that's a .125. So that's already larger. So so we can compare it to a 10 interesting 16 2.0 6251 16th is less than one-tenth. So this is the first digit for the first coefficient that we can add that doesn't break the constraint that we end up larger than x  the first coefficient where it's safe to add it and we don't end up with something larger than x  so here it seems like maybe it's a reasonable to put a one here and start talking about extending this more and more.  There's .625. The next number is going to be a 1 / 32.  1/32 should we had this position will that put us over at 10 about the arithmetic here?  Yeah.  Why why can't why is it? Okay.  We could have had it to this point six number that we have so far without going out without over approximating we could also think of that as being too out over 32 from the 1/16 + 1/32 is what we've had in here that 3/32 and 3/32 definitely less than one tenth of a meter larger. So this is also okay to add 1/64 / 64 thinking we were doing before this is going to be 6 / 64 is contributed from these two.  3/32 and then we multiply a numerator and denominator by 2:07 so we can see the 60s, please.  So we can we can work this out to the last few digits. We can keep doing what we're doing for the last few digits.  If I don't want it before doing any arithmetic for this.  Are we going to represent one exact point one? Exactly know it doesn't work out that we can represent 0.1 exactly here is some under approximation some number that's less than point one and there's something interesting about how much it is less than 7.1. But the relationship is between this number in point one. And so there's actually another constraint. I want to talk about here without doing arithmetic. I just don't want to use the last 2 minutes of class on it. But if we go back to our definition, there's actually something that we want to constrain about how far off we end up being don't want to just keep we don't want to just pick any number the smaller and save it always succeeded because ex is larger than you were getting at right now.  Send declare Victory because X is larger than the decimal part 0 and then we we say we have a good approximation. We are in this approximation going to give this definition is that we could always fix. So I'm just going to call it the approximation and what it what I mean by the approximation is the whole expression on the right hand side of the greater than equals.  they are or here is  Error that we could fix by using no more than the next by no more than the next.  Whoops W Prime minus one. So no more than the next coefficient. "
