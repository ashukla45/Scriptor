You shouldn't come here expecting me to teach at 9 a.m. On Monday and we'll all be happy. So the thing I want to talk about today is I want to text you going to finish off a story. We've been telling and I'll even telling me for the past few lectures about sizes and I want to sort of put up a picture that's about the proof. We finished on Wednesday and then show how that relates to these funny mathematical object called the real numbers. So on on Wednesday. We we did a proof that talked about the set of natural numbers and the power set of the natural numbers not being the same size one of the big things we ended up discussing in that proof was this relationship?  That's obviously this is the interesting thing the sizes are different. And so that gives us three different kinds of vitamin roster notation countably infinite sets which are a bunch of the families of numbers. We know about and things like Cartesian products of countably infinite sets and things like the linked list of natural numbers has lots of things that are countably infinite. These are the things where we can sort of map some back and forth between the natural numbers and then we showed that there's this other kind of uncountable sets that we can't not the natural numbers and I just I want to draw a picture that goes with the the proof we did on Wednesday also sort of remind you of what the proof on Wednesday look like. So we had that this contradiction lips  Where we were considering arbitrary functions from the naturals to the power set of natural and for the size of the naturals to be the same as the size of the power set of natural. We would need some function f that's a bijection and we set this up by contradiction so that we could assume  I asked is a bijection. That's why we  I always have to stop and then the to show was the f is onto.  and  we went through this proof and it turned out that the thing we needed was this really interesting set that we talked about for a witness for one of the properties in the proof. And that's the sad I want to talk about it talk about a picture for  we talked about the set. It was called capital D on the handout from Wednesday.  And it was all the EX's such that.  X is not an element of not a member of the result of applied to acts so X is not in the sense that you get when you apply as to ask the meaning of this and I want to push through the whole truth goes through and gave us and gave us this result. But it was very symbolic what this looks like for a particular arbitrary F words for any function from the naturals to the power set of natural that you would be able to do this particular for a particular function look like well it's going to have to have values defined for every natural number.  What it means for us to have the naturals as its domain and each one of the outputs.  4 ought to be a set of natural numbers. That's what it means for the power set of natural numbers to be its go to name so that we might think about as being interested since this is an arbitrary function any sets. I right here are a reasonable definition for f we have to we would have to talk about all the possible functions F. So I'm going to leave some underscores in places where I've sort of left out an element.  So this first result of zero I'm saying is the set of all the natural numbers except for 0.  Just defining a function one of the one of these pots at a time.  For one, I mean a Define this to be all of the let's do all of the elements.  So this is going to not have zero.  I will have wine at won't have to it will have three it won't have for it will have five and so on. So if we give one into this function, we get off we get the set of all odd numbers back.  For 2 I'm going to pick all the prime numbers.  So is your own one of the two is prime free is Prime 4 is not frying 5 is Prime and so on and so is zeros include one's not included to his three isn't for is 5 isn't installing.  And we can think about having really interesting potentially infinite Lisa infinite size set for every single output from this function. But this is an example of some of the inputs and outputs for some arbitrary function. We could imagine from Naturals two sets of Naturals. And the thing I want to have you think about for a minute is given this definition of of what does D look like  In roster notation at least what is D start to look like in roster notation definition of set builder notation, at least for the first few elements of DB if we're writing them out in order to speak.  some of those I wanted to be  how come we systematically go through the natural numbers and asked if each one was an element of D is 0 an element.  Is 0 an element of d?  091 + 50  if you think zero is an element of D hum.  Some humming you think zero is not an element of d,  Just got their homes on both sides. So just got this is zero an element of D. If I were to run start writing out a here listing out the elements when I include 0  Okay, is it so I have to think about this for a minute maybe talking about it is zero in volunteering answer and why?  So you're looking at?  The place where we use zero as an argument as an input to F and then you're looking here and saying okay zeros not an element of F100 is not an element of f of zero that corresponds to saying over here zero is not an element of f of zero.  So that means that it would be included in D. Cuz that's the definition of these all the elements where those elements are not in the output for f  So I'm going to just keep the color inconsistent here zero is included in the South Pole.  So that means 1md is 1 + 50.  I see you had shaking and was not an element of D with look here and here where we use one as an argument and check if it's in the output if it is so we would not include one in the Scentsy wouldn't be included.  We can look at where the input is 2 and check if 2 is in the output it is so that's not an element of d.  and we can look at  3 + check if 3 is in the output for 3 and that is not an element of its own out. So it is an element of d.  And we could... This out and talk about this for every possible input to F and these elements.  Exactly when that element doesn't appear in its own output consequence of this and we can see for each one of these sets now.  Apple zero definitely is not equal to d0 is Indie and it's not an S10.  half of 1 is not in is not equal to D because one is in F1, but it's not MD and when you get this evidence for every single  Every single possible input because of how we constructed the reconstructed be so it would have exactly this property that is not equal to the output for any of these Rose D is some element of the power set of natural numbers at some set of natural numbers.  The intuition for why this function can't possibly be on to because no matter what we pick as the outputs for every natural number. We can Define be this way and find some that's not equal to any one of these sets because it differs in exactly one element.  or at least one element  this a kind of proof comes up a couple different times and a couple different places in both computer science theory and in math math in general and the reason it has the name it does is because you often think about and then talking about the relationship between the input which is coming next value and something about that index in the output and the since the index order moves to not to look left or right you get this diagonal pattern and so this is called a diagonalization argument.  And I picked for four output sets that we're kind of interesting cuz I got to have to get to the word included in D into that weren't but if you you can try that you can come up with any outfit. So you think you can possibly think of for the sets and you'll always be able to construct D using this property and it'll be different from all of us the proof that we did on Wednesday with the symbolic way of telling us that's going to happen for any possible function we choose but this is the visual that goes with it.  And this explains so there was this picture that we didn't get to fill in at the bottom here. But this explains why this picture why this picture was on the side, which is one way to think about this. Is that here we have all of the possible all about footsteps capital x 0 through capital and we're going to be really interested in the answer to the question for this along the diagonal because that's what the interesting part of constructing of constructing this set. That's not going to be able to any of these rows.  So that's what that picture is for sure going back and reviewing the notes for Wednesday.  Any questions about this about this argument under this picture? I want to go on and talk about how this is related to real numbers. Next is really closely related. But any questions about this argument before we go on  Okay, cool. Let's talk about numbers.  This was a question. I think this was from the other section, but someone asks after class. Are there any talking about the relationship between the power set of some other set right? Maybe that's only maybe this property of being uncountable only happens when we do this power set operation so we can talk about it don't have that relationship and the answer is actually the real numbers are going to turn out to have the property of being uncountable. They're not going to exist in this one one relationship with a Naturals.  And there's lots of ways to sort of.  Define talk about poker get properties of the real numbers this class in one lecture can sort of do justice to the construction. And if however the real numbers are defined, but we can get some intuition for them. And it says nice. It's this part of the conclusion that this is leading for a real numbers are pretty interesting mathematical objects. And there is reasons why it's hard to represent them in a computer. So that's that's part of what's going on here and turns out rational numbers are a lot easier to represent in the computer then real numbers because of some of these reasons.  People are so there's different ways to think about these things that there anything that you could write down that exists somewhere on the number line including this one way to think about the real numbers another definition given any number that has some decimal expansion even after the decimal point is infinitely long. We can somehow Express at all these decimal numbers.  There's some other things that we can say about this. There is a math approach and there's a little call out to be interested in that 1:40. If you want to dive deeper into the properties of the real numbers and there's like a bunch of things we can say about it's a super set of integers is a superset of the rationals. It's totally ordered meaning that we can talk of any two real numbers we can talk about which one is smaller or if there are equal and there's this one interesting property about the real numbers that we're going to use for a sketch another sketch of why the real numbers are actually uncountable on this property called the nested closed interval property that says if we take an interval of real number so you can imagine different intervals of real numbers. I'm going to focus on one today that are between  0 in 1 just to keep everything fractional. If you take an interval of real numbers that notation means all the real numbers starting at including 0.5 up to and including 0.7. You can always take a smaller interval by making a left side larger and or making the right side smaller.  And there will still be at least one real number in that interval. So as long as this interval doesn't cross like you don't end up with the upper bound lower than there's been the lower bound as long as they don't cross and they just get closer to one another. There's always going to be at least one real number in that interval always going to work out no matter what infinite sequence of narrowing you do he can keep getting their own there are now and there is always some real number in there. We already know this isn't true for rationals.  Because if you make the interval narrow down infinitely on the \u221a 2 we know that can't be represented by a rational number. So if you pick some interval to just keep the proximate in the \u221a 2 more and more and more and more getting closer and closer to \u221a to eventually not going to be a number there that can be represented by a rational number.  So the real number is sometimes even just get defined as having this property that you can always make a smaller interval and there's always at least one real number in between in between those that narrowing and interval will use that in a minute.  There's also a computer science see approach to this or more programming approach to this this resonates with me cuz I write a lot of programs which is the idea that we could represent a real number there as a function that takes an index like it takes index 1 2 3 4 5 6 takes any natural or any positive integer as an index and tells you what the digit is at that position in the expansion of the number in this case. We use 01. So talking about it being a binary expansion, but you can also talk about it being zero through nine. If you want to talk about it expansion Implement you write a function that says you tell me how much Precision you want and I will compute Pi for you out to that number or I'll compute Pi * \u221a 2 for you. I would to that number of  And that's another way to define a real number you define it in terms of this function that takes an index and gives you back the digit at that index in this turned out to be this really get them 4 minutes of Wolfram Alpha. There's plenty of sort of high-precision math programs that you can ask it for some number of digits and it will Faithfully do the computation out to that number of digits. It might take a very long time to come back if you ask for 2 million or 2 billion or 2 trillion digits, but it will it will eventually calculate that  you may have heard of her may be interested in you can just  you can look up all of the research that goes into calculating digits of pi understand what it means to be able to implement these functions, but these functions are implemented in software packages and there another way to define a real number as a function that can a computer to some precision.  Pencil just some examples of what this what this looks like. I want me to find real numbers this way.  So a couple examples here actually what I want to do you have these written out on your worksheet as well as them being on a slide. I want you to just we're going to work with them on the back of the worksheet in a minute. But I want you to read these talk about them a little bit and come up with any questions you have about that these three definitions before we go on the read them found them up with questions about them and talk about what's interesting about these definition of real numbers.  Questions about these definitions how they work what they do how you would try and build another one. Yeah.  Yeah, what is the last definition mean? Yeah, this is like the ultimate just Define the darn function in English and don't give a symbolic form, right? It's like using calculus is left to the reader. So let's see. Let me I'm just going to get some empty space to talk about this for a second. So just had some empty space on it the function looking at it is \u221a 2 - 1  Salisbury to 2-1 looks kind of like kind of like that starts at -1 and grows kind of slowly. It's a parabola.  And so there is a strategy for doing this the things are Google if you're interested in seeing what an actual implementation looks like. It's called Newton's method but the idea is you pick some points on line and let's say we were trying or trying to find maybe where this is equal to zero like we're trying to find a route for the thing you pick some point some value of x to start at and you use the derivative to compute a line. That's the slope at that point and then you move along the line some amount.  Towards towards the solution.  And you then find another spot here and again calculate the tangent line move some amount here towards the solution and you repeatedly do this back and forth calculation using the straight-line none of which are perfectly accurate because in general these terms can be pretty curvy you get a little bit closer on the theorems of calculus tell us how far away we are after a given number of steps of doing this and so that even try and write symbolically in this class, but the high-level intuition is if you tell me you want to be within one 1,000 for the answer I can tell you how many iterations I have to do of this approximation process to get there. And so these are the strategies that are used in like that medical Computing libraries in numerical Computing libraries to say that those properties like give me two thousand digits of pi.  And these are implemented what we can Define it if we know how to define a derivative in a recursive function. We can Define this. If not, it's not an incredibly difficult function to Define. It's just an interesting function to to analyze.  But you can definitely write this letter questions about these definitions.  That's more direct questions about than then.  I'm curious what you how you sort of feel about this set. And this is the set of numbers real numbers between 0 and 1 not including 0 on one so strictly less than 10 in both cases.  And keep in mind that this is less than the set of all real numbers, right? I'm really restricting the the range here.  5 4 3 2 1 and I want you to talk about this kind a hard at least I find it difficult to figure out the right vocabulary to use when talking about Infinities. And so all five of these answers are kind of designed to either be interesting ways to say something that slightly incorrect with terminology or they could be made more precise by using different words and have a conversation about this and use words like in Fannett countable and uncountable and figure out what they mean in this context. I mean, it's I think it's an interesting thing where you have to talk about it a few times to figure out what these things really mean the fastest restaurant.  I'm really find someone near you to talk to you if you're not if you find yourself not talking in East discussion.  All right. All right. So let's I'm curious what folks talked about it. I think that one of these if they settled on one of these answers that they think is right. None of these are actually right, but it wouldn't folks talk about what it folks.  discuss  Nothing that they want to share what had folks discuss.  Yes, we are highlighting this word and saying this word maybe you saying you certain kind of believe the statement but this word doesn't seem like the right justification. So like  but the natural numbers also has infinitely many elements adjusting. There's an infinite number of something doesn't necessarily justify that it's uncountable.  Everything else of people as sort of picked out of these claims or talked about that. They thought was interesting here.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, that's a good question. So theorem is theorem in Lima are both words that just mean hey pay attention to this property. They say nothing about it being true or false. You can prove a theory you in general. It would be odd to write a mathematical work where you claim the theorem and then didn't prove it raining theorem in front of it is just a signal that you should probably expect there to be approved. But the proof you have a mistake, really just label statements to say these are interesting statements that are true in the sequence of if we don't label all of them cuz they might not be interesting really interesting to get to that final statement. So just labels  I almost think of it is almost like a methods or method names in a programming language. Like it's important enough chunk that you decided to name it cuz you might want to use it later, but it's still your job to test the method and read the code in the method and make sure it works right just because just because you wrote a method header doesn't mean the method works.  So I'm actually poked at this this idea that it's not enough to say that there's infinitely many elements to justify the set is uncountable. We really have to show one of these one of these kinds of properties that we've been talking about, which is that size of that set the real numbers between 0 and 1 has a different size of the larger size than the set of natural numbers. So I want to talk about this in two ways. One is a version of Wednesday's diagonalization argument and then another is using that property of narrowing down intervals.  So I'm the first thing I want to talk about is what these representations that we just saw us. We just saw these representations where we talked about having a function compute the digit of each index. There's another way to think about this which is that this is a representation where we have a set of indices where the digit is one.  What's a function computes the 0 or 1 and 1/8 is a set definition in Sepultura notation. It says we're going to represent a real number between 0 and 1 by talking about exactly the set of indices where it has a one exactly the set of indices where has a one so in his first case.  What is the set of indices where this has a one we write it in roster notation?  Set of indices where this has a one bit set.  One Direction Center.  Justin next one. So if we label these digits all within 2 Season, let's say we started 0-4 the number before the decimal point because we're going to be we don't we're never going to talk about zero with this girl is talking about the the numbers between 0 and 1 exclusive will call this index one. And so this would be an index one. There's a one bit in the binary expansion of 1/2.  This one's a little more interesting because we're talking about all of these spots and we had that way but in roster notation as it's like four or five and then six seven eight nine.  And then another four added on to that so that's going to be 12:13. And that patterns just going to continue using mods. I'm just not going to rewrite that here. But the idea is that this starts to look an awful lot like the strategy we used when we were talking about inputs and outputs to the function that went from Naturals to the power set of Naturals number on the left hand side. And then there's some on the right hand side that were talking about. That's pretty interesting. Now, there's all these Seth and all of these are steps of positive integers using to talk about the reals.  And the interesting thing we can do here is start talking about representing more real numbers this way. There's lots more real numbers we could talk about.  And trying to lay out all of the real numbers that exist and each one is going to have some representation as a set in particular. This one I think next to is the only place where we'll have something in the binary expansion so we can just keep listing for the sets of  For the sets of numbers to a power sets of natural we can pick elements along a diagonal. And in this case. I have to rearrange this a little bit to make it look super diagonal like we had before so let's do that for is going to be over here to is going to be somewhere around there. We have the blank spots around this.  and we could talk about then doing the same bag analyzation argument where we look at first number second number their number and so on all the way down on that diagonal and we could always build a new real number by talking about using a flipping all of the bits and all of those positions and that new real numbers not going to be equal to any of the real numbers in this table because it will differ in one bit at least one bit from each number because we construct at this way and that lets us know that if we tried to list all the real numbers in a table, like you've every real number a natural number index we would always be able to construct a new one who's actually the same argument is a little bit of detailing picking how to represent these things as binary numbers are decimal numbers example, or we have this infinite lists of the set of a set of natural numbers are in this case positive integers and  But we can always construct a real it's not in here. So this is actually this this way of writing. This is similar to something you'll see called cancers.  laissez shine  are you in?  When cancer is in the counter shutter Bernstein theorem, and it's written version written out with the digits of real numbers written out with... Trailing off and real numbers and trailing off below and as a demonstration that the real numbers are not countable.  So here I'm just a feeling to this idea that we did the proof for the power set of natural and so we could apply the same idea here.  There's another idea we could use to talk about this even just a set of real numbers between 0 and 1.  Using is nested closed interval property.  And there's an overall strategy here, which is that no matter how we try to build a set of nested closed intervals. No matter what number what number we're looking at. We can always build a nest of the closed interval to contain some real number isn't equal to a particular number we're looking for. I'm so for each input natural number if we pick some set of reels for the output. We're always going to be able to find some chunk of the real numbers are there different from that side of real?  So this actually gets much more concrete if we pick an example. So one thing this of course have to work for all for all functions. But again much like I picked a specific function to show why this kind of thing is true for the diagonalization argument. It's useful to think about this in the case of a really specific function here. So let's think about this particular function one plus sign of end over to think about what this function looks like to come up with an e and first of all think about the picture trying to draw a little picture for yourself and what this function looks like and also think about this property and see if you have any questions or comments about the statement of this property before we go forward showing some stuff about to take a minute to think about this function what it looks like the statement of the property and how this function right away.  I really do think about drawing a little function.  I graph for what one plus sign it on over to looks like.  Questions or comments about first of all this graph and then also how this function relates to the statement questions you have about the statement concerns. You have a relating to function in the statement think is a couple interesting things going on their notation Ali and in the definition here that I want to see if you pick out  What is a function look like? What should I be drawing here?  Looks like this the line.  Yes, it is a / 2 and if we can talk about it inside the parentheses would extend the. Versus outside and shortening the wavelength of it in this case of shortening the wavelength exactly right about the translation up right thing. You said would be if we divided by 2 inside we get something with it. It was extended but in this case what we're getting is it starts at point five and we shorten the wavelength. So what this looks like is here's one hears.  0.5 + 200  so skinny bounded above by 1 and Below by 0.5.  Okay, cool a picture. Nice that jumps all over the place.  Shortening the oh, sorry shortening the amplitude. Thank you. I just used the wrong word. Thank you. Calculator can screws up. Thanks, like what's going on here what's going on in this table? And your hand out what's going on with this relationship the table in his property? Why do we care about this function? Why is it an interesting function?  My own here. I copy this picture down.  First of all one thing that you should is a really nice thing to do whenever you see a new statement and properties, especially when you're writing your own proofs is you should take check them meaning look at every function look at its domain and codomain see if that matches the property you're talking about see if you agree with the with the use of any variable in its type in and where the variables used if it's the right type in that position there any type problems here or type or interesting type remarks you want to make here?  Types here is Naturals. Israel's going on.  So what what should the type of FB according to the to show?  The domains Naturals and the co domain is the set of rules between 0 and 1 and this is just real. Okay, I mean if a little bit interesting we might hit one here, but okay, so you can question that ended up being in the right range that we didn't go outside the school that we were aiming for that's nice and then we have this big table of values and we're trying to talk about this interval idea. What kind of stuff should we be thinking about writing over an interval area then like if we have these specific real numbers these specific zero what kinds of things could we even think about writing over here types of stuff movie think about describing over here in this interval area?  Might I right.  interval look like  I was also examples earlier we had things like 0.5 0.7. Does that match this description hear of avoiding Ativan?  I see some shaking vigorously shaking head. They might want to pick something like  that is definitely not including FM.  Cool. So there's a lot of intervals we could right here that might avoid having been in this next line.  With this interval is eternal definitely doesn't contain 0.9 to 7:35.  I see some shaking hands. Why is this not a good choice?  Yeah.  This doesn't work because it's not in nested inside 0.6 0.8.  So in this case, we don't have to do very much interesting refining of the interval still closed. Number. I can actually use the center of a bunch.  Let's see. Let's make it a little I'm actually going to make this one step more interesting so we can talk about how we have to narrow it down more. So let's say we started well, let's say we started with  this interval we can pick this first and over interval that we do in a number of ways. I'm just thinking something that definitely doesn't contain 0.5. In this case. We wouldn't be able to pick the same interval again when just be able to pick the same thing again because that would contain this next number so we have to find some way to build up another nested interval.  It doesn't contain that doesn't contain that next number.  And that process is a process that we have to keep repeating. We be able to use the same one in this case until all the way down here where we have to pick some other.  Interval that didn't contain that number.  If there's somehow exclude 0.8.  And if we wanted to do a proof for this what we have to end up talking about is how to construct one of these new nested closed intervals that avoids next number we're looking at what we have to do is take our interval compare it to the current number we're looking at and somehow construct a new winner of all that and so there's a couple ways to sketch doing this proof.  One that is hinted at which I think is one useful way to think about this.  Is it in each of these steps? What happens is we take the initial interval that we had we divided into thirds and then we pick one that we know is going to exclude the element. So one way to do this if you wanted to set this up and sort of a recursive style in a proof is if you take one of these intervals and divided into thirds you end up knowing that one of those can't possibly include the element you're looking at.  Because all of the real numbers are are in order. So either the element isn't in the interval already or it's in one of the three intervals and you just pick one far away from that. So there's a nice way to construct a proof for this. "
