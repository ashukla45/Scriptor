    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started. So I want to continue some of our discussion of different sets of numbers today. We're also going to do another look at the beginning we're going to do an interesting proof by contradiction. And then I want to talk about numbers a little bit last week where we talked about this robot that was on a grid. Can we use it as an example of defining a set recursively we talked about all of the positions the robot could reach so it started so we're in our example of 0 0 and it's sure it's starting at one of those lemons we proved was that all of the positions that can reach even if it starts at a spot that has an even sum and that was a nice little proof that let us use structural induction and serve the base case was being a 0-0 and then based on the definition of the set we can talk about adding up those ones and negative ones and always getting to another even number for the sum of the coordinates and I was the inductive step. And then I totally wave my hands when we finish the proof and talk about why that meant the robot couldn't reach 1010 what happened at the end of that proof when we did last week and so it turns out the last step you need if you want to make that proof is a proof by contradiction that looks like so there's a couple extra definitions of here because it's useful for this proved to be really precise about what we mean by odd and even give some statements that are maybe I'll be up to us having work with numbers for most of our lives but giving you a precise definition. There's some number such that n is equal to 2 times a number K such that n is equal to 2 k + 1 I'm just back from visiting the book and there's a discussion of it in the book. We believe all this but it's nice to be clear that these are the properties were going to be using.  And so the idea here is if we were trying to go from this limo, which said that all the positions the robot can reach have some of coordinates even what is the proof by contradiction look like the prove the robot the robot can never reach 10. What does it look like? We want to set this up and say we use proof by contradiction. What does it look like I want to ask is what is going to turn out to be the Assumption we make in this proof by contradiction of P. We talked about this thing that we end up assuming as an important step of this proof by contradiction. That's the first thing I want to I want to ask about here.  5 4 3 2 1 answers here. He is a plurality but not a majority.  Nothing to the thing to be thinking about what ends up being the Assumption after we do that.  Okay Quicken again freaking again.  5 4 3 2 1 the answer is misleading. So I hope he's not what we're going to pick are you should discuss away from maybe the initial saying that was easy to easy to answer but doesn't fit the problem.  So let's talk about how we how we would sort of Mastiffs to this proof structure. We need to pick something that's going to be that we're going to use in the are that we're going to use we're going to use for it by contradiction. We need to make sure we can clearly identify with those two pieces are contradiction the thing we're trying to prove.  He ought to be the thing. We're trying to prove. What are we trying to prove here?  What's the statement we're trying to prove?  resent resent  10 this thing is a nice English description of tea by talking about this debt. We had this set big p that was recursively defined Seth and so one way to write this is that one zero  Is not in that set of all the positions that can be reached.  That's what that little that little statement you were trying to prove.  We're trying to get to.  We can think about what are interesting. Are there going to be to choose here. I'm going to move our off to the side for a second because there's a useful point to make sure which is that we have some sense that are is going to be about being even or odd and problematic overlap where we can prove it at even and not even or something like that. Right? That's that's where this is going on. So we'll pick an r that works well for that but in terms of using a proof by contradiction, that means that new to show based on proof by contradiction is going to be the negation of P. So that's one zero is in P implies.  are and not our  before using a proof by contradiction make it so that we can do that.  And so one interesting thing. I want to point out about the way you end up getting proof by contradiction is it is really the next step here is  essentially always going to be if I direct proof.  We're going to assume that negation of P.  Do we have an implication we want to prove the implication? And so we're going to assume this and try and show that are and not are are both true.  proof by contradiction really if we're talking about this in terms of the strategy leucine proof by contradiction gives you an implication to proof and then direct proof by assuming the hypothesis about implication of these two steps that happen and we're going to make this assumption C  So we are going to end up assuming the negation of the thing. We're trying to prove and then we're trying to demonstrate that we can prove both some property are and not our that will choose carefully to make sure the problem.  how many suggestions for a we should pick for our it would be interesting to choose for our  listen to choose for our properties for our  Choose the lemon the sum of the coordinates of any position reachable by the robot is even interesting. That's interesting. So you're saying see ya symbolically.  Let's summarize. What if I want to just get the symbolic form of this Lima up so that we can talk about it. The thing we want to choose who we have for all.  Let's call it.  XY that are in this that big p  x + y is even  interesting. So you're saying we can do it we can just choose the limit here.  Cool, so maybe this is exactly what we want on peaches in here.  Call that are.  What does that work? That's what I was going to choose at work.  What comes next for come next?  I picked something else when I do this, but I did this before but I think this might work.  but if  10 is in  oh that  It is not very similar to the proof. We did on Monday where we know that our is true by this planet that we proved before we already proved that this for Allstate mode proved it true. That was the structural induction proof. We did last week. We showed that this was this was true based on the definition of p by structural induction. So if R is true already, we only have to show not our to show the RN. R and well not a statement. How do we disapprove of her all statement? Well, we are trying to prove this negation of a frost so we can think about it as right finding a witness for the negation is true.  And that's interesting. So now we can so I might just to be really precise here rewrite this as there exists some x y  This is interesting. It's in pee.  And I act is going to be the negation of x + y is even.  So we can find some X and Y that are in pee and then show that x + y is not even then we'll have demonstrated not our and this is just biological equivalent some what it means to negate after all.  And now it seems like it's going to work to choose one zero is a witness here, right? Because we know that one zero it is indeed. That's one of our assumptions. So it's definitely an okay Witness by assumption it matches this for constraints on the domain of the existential cuz we assumed it by contradiction gave us is to assume this witness. So I'm if we choose  100 as a witness here  we need to show.  that not  1 + 0 is even  And now just by the definition of what it means to be even and what it means to be odd. We can finish this off in particular. We can write 1 + 0 as an odd number. If you look at the definition of odd will be able to write 2 * 0 + 1 so it matches the definition of being an odd number and if we know that a number is either odd, or even then it definitely can't be even if it's odd.  so this is definitely True by definition of  even odd  So you proved are we proved not are all we assumed is the negation of the property. We were trying to prove us off. So.  One zero is not in key.  It will be proved that we prove that this one zero. I said I can't possibly be in the original property that we stated back up here.  And that ends up being the conclusion of the whole proof.  So we just grab the limo made that limo be the thing that we were trying to prove both is true and not true since we had the existing proof. We know it's true and then we pushed the Assumption through meaning of using it as a witness to an existential in this case.  Yeah, that's what I do. I text OnePlus 0 is odd and then like clearly that's true because of the definition of odd and then I showed it was not odd by applying the Lema and saying well if it's then it must be even even then it's not on and get to the get to this conclusion.  I like taking a lemon here. I didn't think of that because it matches what we did on on Monday as well. We sort of pick something. We already knew in that made that I made one half of the RM not are easy to show. Okay. So that's another instance of proof by contradiction. The main thing I want to say about proof by contradiction will do another one today. But the main thing I want to say about proof by contradiction is make sure you understand what the original thing you're trying to prove is understand the structure of this implication that's being built.  And I understand that you're assuming this negation of this thing. You're trying to prove you're assuming a negation of the property you're trying to prove and you can think of it as carefully step-by-step there to find P&R carefully, then you'll be doing an accurate proof by contradiction.  So I want to talk about numbers a little bit more.  Mom, and I also want to talk about nested quantifiers a little bit. So the thing to be looking for carefully is that the AP and seas are in different order. They're all for all for all he's a B and C are in different orders here near the equation in the in the predicate of the same. These are true are true statements.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so this is so close to the time so close to a tie. You won't know if it's a trick question.  Okay freaking again.  5 4 3 2 1  okay. Alright, so I'm a lot so it's not a lot but significant number of folks moved from answers that weren't a towards a  let's see. So why not being see in one of her reason? Why not being see when I describe it?  I understand. So you're saying let's assume that be in fear equals. They started giving a counterexample here is a big set of counterexample. If you're saying we're B&C are equal then a must be zero, but 0 does not is not an element of Z + z + starts at 1.  Holmesburg for option b and option C. They both have this problem interesting. Well that it's a problem. Let's just say he is greater than C.  In here, so looking still an option b, let's say that b is greater than C.  Then a must be what?  negative  can we get a maze at the naturals like big an end? And then we would have been able to solve the one with zeros but we still wouldn't be able to solve equation that needs negative numbers equations that we'd like to solve and we can't solve the equation. We can't come up with a value for a if we stay within the positive integer. We have to go to the negative integers equations going to look like the same equations with this is  The sort of operation so here I have the same kinds of things with Platinum not extended to times. So let's look at this one and I picture answers for this one.  5 4 3 2 1  call  okay freaking again and again  Okay.  5 4 3 2 1  but if not all the above Okay, so  The first one is we went to the negative numbers in the first one, but it's similar to answer. Is it similar properties on the last line? We can always find solutions for value for Steve. It's going to be nice just choose a + b is that value on then? We know that that's going to be part of the integer. But we have a census that we can do that kind of arithmetic in be by going to all of the integers. We start to solve the problem with options B&C on the last slide. We're now if for example B is greater than  we can choose a negative number for a so we can choose a negative number for a  Mousie is saying well if we multiply and be together, can we always find a c that also seems to have a pretty pretty clear pretty clear answer we can multiply two integers together and just talk about that integer doesn't matter if it's positive or negative. We going to talk about multiplying with the other and there is the result problem 4D.  Yeah.  So you're saying a equals 2 and C is equal to one is a problem christening 1/2 and but 1/2 is not an integer.  Darn now this Mark ways and we can solve with integers the ones that involve multiplication.  So clearly we like the rational numbers right rational numbers are all the numbers where we can find a numerator and a denominator where the denominator is not 0 we're both the numerator and denominator are integers such as a definition and a pretty good definition of the set of rational numbers and now help us solve equations, involving multiplication equation involving multiplication. We realize that with natural numbers, we couldn't solve all the addition equation. So we had a negative number so we can solve all the addition equation the rational numbers to solve a multiplication equation enough to solve multiplication equations.  Which of these are true?  5 4 3 2 1 I'm just got the right answers, but not all of them are true.  Okay Quicken again Quicken again.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, so  Which one of these is not true which one of these is not true.  Seem ABD so we can think about the witnesses here. So I'm in a anyting where p is equal to 0 work. We can pick you with a very large number is the numerator is 0 then the number times itself will be able to zero.  Here we can choose an X where p is equal to 1 and Q is equal to one and then 1/1 * 1/1 is one. So let's go to this one and see if we can do D. And maybe it's just a and b equals x x x take me to both sides and get that at least one answer is 3/2 equals act any other answers?  Why don't you I suggest suggest other answers?  What are other answers to the negative 3 over 2 because when we deposit is a financier to pick we could also pick based on the definition of rationals up there three over negative two things like 6 / -4 and all kinds of interesting Witnesses for this and another that we can pick up here also.  Lots of answers to somebody's work out.  She is an interesting question like Hennessy work, but I want to talk about it is an interesting proof by contradiction that speed is not that she has no witness. And in fact, the rational numbers are not enough to solve equations and I care about involving number right? I could have gone like one step simpler with the natural numbers is another representation of the natural numbers. It's even simpler and we could go further past this but we're we're doing like the middle of number theory in like 25 minutes. So this is this is this is like the crash course in number theory if you like it take a number 3 course because it's it's. I just mean like if you're finding this stuff fun, like number three purses are or what you should you should take. I mean, we're not going to abandon numbers. I'm just saying we don't have time to talk about like a really simple represent.  Mission of numbers which is almost like unary all the way through building up the set of all the real numbers that we can't do all that in the street. Now, would you like it? That's a that's a place to look. Let's talk about the square root of 2 for a minute. It's an interesting mathematical object. Let's talk about it. So which of these are true about the \u221a 2 or not true?  Impart a reminder about some properties about this number so we can keep track of what's going on here. But 5 4 3 2 1  so this is kind of interesting in that based on what we said about square roots. We might be able to pick up negative number is the answer to the square root of 2, so a is kind of interesting one of the positive husband to it definitely is greater than or equal to one.  But basically just reminding us that \u221a 2 is going to be some number between one and two and it's going to have some big long representation if we tried to write it out with all the Stephen. So let's imagine trying to prove that the square root of 2 is not a rational number that seems to be what we're getting at here with the rationals don't include this where we can solve this equation.  So here's one. Here's one potential potential here kind of a start and maybe a conclusion to a prude. Just take a minute to read it.  here grumbles  What song is this? What song is this?  And it didn't work.  Because it's not out of its not an integer. So yeah.  Just thing him prove that there are no legitimate Witnesses, but it's like I didn't work.  Looking for other ways of raising your complaint.  Yeah, so so I like both of these descriptions. I'm going to use some of the words from both of them to describe what we're trying to show is that has not exist.  Hey, let's say.  P over Q that's in the rationals.  with square root of 2 equals p over Q  We're looking for to show not that there's some p and Q that doesn't work, but there is no possible p&q that could work. There's no rational number that could work here comment. That was made is this is logically equivalent to for all p over q that are in the rationals.  square root of 2 does not equal  Instances of raw there is no role for a witness here. We're trying to prove after all so demonstrating something is a useful way to explore the property, but it's not a proof we would have to do something with induction or with universal generalization or some other proof strategy in order for this to work.  So the main point here is just fine negating a witness. That doesn't mean that we proved it for all or just by demonstrating one witness. That doesn't really prove deferral talk about this.  In a different way am I going to use proof by contradiction? And so what we're going to try and say is that the \u221a 2 is an element of the rational. So that's the existential I wrote above where we going to be able to find will assume that we can find a p and Q that make this true and then we'll be trying to write an implication. Some property is both true and.  Actually, yeah, so here's the here's some of the information we're going to need to do it and use our dilemmas that are at the bottom of the back side of the hand out.  And one important definition we are going to need here is this idea of a greatest common denominator? And so I want to just have to question about the greatest common denominator so that we can be on the same page about what greatest common denominator means so here is the greatest common denominators. That's the largest number that we can find at the factor of both of these number. I want to ask which one of these are accurate greatest common denominator statement. So I think I'll just for a minute and then  But using this in the proof.  Greatest common divisor sorry I said denominator, but the way the books that is says it is divisor. So use that word.  5 4 3 2 1  OK Google so is not true because we can find a bigger number that divides both be is true. Three is the biggest number that will divide 9 and 21 C is not true.  Because three doesn't divide 7 three not a factor of 7 is also true.  Because three and seven don't share any common factors other than one that's the only time they they definitely we don't have any factors other than one in themselves. So this last name of these two options are related to let no one know if you look at the definition of Lima one, it says that the greatest common divisor of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor has to be one we're going to assume that for not going to we're not going to demonstrate this but to instantiate this claim for this example would be saying that 9/3, 21 / 3. If we take the greatest common divisor of those numbers that people for one and that if we start reducing it is three 7  any ideas we / the biggest factor that they shared so the only factor that they can share now is 1  so this is important because it's just let us talk about numbers and he's reduced term where we know that there is no other multiples floating around four square root of 2.  Greatest greatest common divisor and then we can set up then we can use some information about that later on in this proof to set things up. So what we're going to do is assume the negation of the property want so we're going to assume that there exists such that I can't possibly be the case. So we're going to assume that the first step that's important here is that we're going to take you and make sure that they're in lowest terms Weiser / the greatest common divisor mean come up with these two values of A and B.  Mom that we know have a greatest common divisor this one.  Those fairy tutu is going to be equal to this number and B and IND don't share any factors.  So, let's see where we can get from here. I haven't picked I haven't told you what are is going to be yet, and we haven't talked about what are is going to be a little bit of 32 is equal to A over B, Algebra 2 is equal to a squared over B squared.  A squared over B squared, which means that this is just by squaring.  both signs  But sometimes in a proof by contradiction, one of the things that I end up doing is I play with something that I have a little bit and that help me decide on what an interesting result for our might be manipulating the equation a little bit to see if I can get somewhere interesting or I'll find something related to some property that I can prove and disprove. This tells us to be squared is equal to a square just reorganizing.  I mean that's kind of interesting this tells us that a squared must be even.  cuz equal to 2 times something that's the definition of even from earlier by the definition of even so they must be even  buy lemon 3 and lemon 3 is the one that says X is even if and only if x squared is even  You can look at it by looking at the way I add numbers and hours of to work. But the this is true. If a number squared is even then the number itself is even  so that's interesting. So a must be even by Lema 3, but that means that equals 2 * k for some k  by the definition  of even  we haven't even number. It's definitely equal to 2 times some other integer interesting fact.  Hi.  Interesting stuff we use this equation. That means that two times B squared is equal to 2 K squared substituting into the equation.  Pine-Sol to be squared is equal to 4 K squared. So B squared is equal to 2 K Square.  Not just reorganizing.  Cool to be square this even to awesome.  B squared is even  that's just by the definition.  even so again B is even  that's Lema 3 again.  Call the A and B are both even that's an interesting discovery about this right cool. If we just start with this assumption, we can drive these two interesting facts as to really interesting facts here one is that a is even so equals to K. Actually, let me Circle this one cuz that's actually the most most interesting way to talk about these two properties.  Thanks. This is kind of funny though because if a and b are both even  That means they both have 2 as a factor.  Want me to find a and b we said that we already found their greatest common divisor.  And so their greatest common divisor is one. We are divided p&q by the greatest common divisor. We said up here.  the greatest common divisor of A and B is 1  Now we've shown that A and B are both even which seems to suggest that they have a greatest common divisor this not one.  but seems like a good way to start thinking about a definition for our  we found this inconsistency. Now, let's try and make it precise. What's a good choice for the definition of our so that we can get from here may be using a lemon that we have two boats are and not what's a good choice for our so that we can take this aggregation of evidence and demonstrate both are and not our give me a choice for our  Okay, suggestions suggestions. It is going to give myself the two minutes to put up a good definition for it.  baby is even so one suggestion for our is B is  even think so hot. So we want to prove that b is even and  Abby is not even even I see the evidence for B must be even right here.  So here is the justification.  4B is even how would I prove it be is not even.  Daiso just splitting us of the first thing. You said I heard you say one is even and that's pretty clearly here. We have that justified and what else?  What else what other evidence do we need to conclude that b is not even?  interesting Soul Emma to says  if gcd of a b equals one then both  are not even  Sorry, I love you. Be more precise.  then  only one of a "
