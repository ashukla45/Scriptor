    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started. So there's too many things I want to do today one is finished the last property that we didn't get to prove on Monday and then review actually a question from homework 3 one of the ones about Caesar ciphers on homework 3 has a pretty good review several different things that are not relevant for the exam is relevant for our exam is this evening? So it's 7 p.m. This evening and began covering everything through last Monday's class. We've been talking about these overall strategies for doing proof and we're going to see a new proof technique today. So another one of these strategies for going from the statement of a sungold we want to show and using some evidence to prove it and it's going to be another one of these properties oversteps. We're going to practice with definitions again, and I want to just refresh our memory about some of the definitions we used on Monday question about power sets. So we were working with the set that we named W and we to find W is the power set of the numbers one through five. And so I just want to refresh your memory about what that definition means. So which of these these Values here are elements of the set wfaw is defined in this way.  5 4 3 2 1 and it's a good one to discuss people have given some different answers. So it's good to discuss.  Do you want?  Okay, we can again again again with updated.  5 4 3 2 1  All right, see how a lot of you were probably looking for many of you may have been looking for f most of the above.  Hoping for that answer to show up because a B and C are all elements of w there all sets that are subsets 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 so it fits the diff definition of pop. This is a subset of the 1 2 3 4 5 set subset of that set.  But this is not a subset of 1 2 3 4 5 it's an element that but it's not a function here between talking about being a subset and being an element of D is the only option that is not an element of this W set because all the elements have to be sets that are subsets of this original 1 2 3 4 5 the numbers like to canopy.  Mainly serves as a reminder of what it means to be a power set what it means to be a subset. And so let's go back to this property that second property was on the handout from Monday and it was a different property than the one we proved. We proved a different property about unions actually show that we did it. We showed that it was fall and this is a property about power set take a minute to try and say this in English to one another so just interpret this logical statement and just come up with what it's saying in English and then we'll talk about whether it's true or false.  Okay, so I want to give one one interpretation here one way that I would translate this that I think reads a sort of reads pretty nicely in English. This is saying for all sets.  a b in W, which is talking about  A&B  are equal  then A and B are equal or are the same set would even do something I'd say at the end today in beer the same equal then those sets my feet take any pair of sets and be in this side in W here. Do you think this claim is true or false? You think this claim is true or false question just be as liquor answers. I do think it's true or false. Are we going to somehow or are we going to be able to find a counterexample?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay. So is this true but many votes for both front a claim like this is to think about example. So what would it look like to fill in some examples for set for A and B and then evaluate the see if it's true true for all the examples we can think of?  So what are some examples that we can fill in fill in for a and b and then try talking about their their values in the statement? Give me some examples of A and B. That would be interesting here examples of A and B.  examples  examples of envy  so when I pick one of them being the set 1 2 3 4 5  Both of them both of them. So equals 1 2 3 4 5 equals 1 2 3 4 5. So this is an interesting example because we picked two sets that are equal two sets that are equal. Would it mean to evaluate the body in 1 2 3 4 5 everywhere and be up here in this statement would be asking is one two, three, four five.  equals power set of 1 2 3 4 5  implies  I think this will work. Well.  implies that these are equal  That's what it means to feel in these values of A and B, whether or not this evaluates to true the conclusion of this implication definitely evaluates to true. So we'd be asking if the power sets of these two things evaluate to true.  Seems like it would be hard for them not to.  Konocti mean week if the power to starter sets of the same sets. It seems like that'll probably evaluate the truth. It would be a lot of work for the same but it'd be very strange didn't produce something. That's the same. What are the examples we could try so this seems Seems like true.  Like true implies true in this case. What are the other cases? We can try other examples we can try that would be interesting.  So we could try a equals 1/2 and B is one so that statement would be the power set of 1/2.  Equal to the power set of just the set containing one implies that one the second any 1/2 is equal to the set containing one. In this case. We know that the conclusion here is going to be false. Those sets are equal better be the case that hypothesis hypothesis were true here. Then we would end up with a counterexample thinking about in a little bit of detail what the power set of 1/2 power set of 1/2. Just seeing how this competition is going to play out talk about it. What's the power set of 1/2?  Okay. So so what what sorts of things are in the power set of one to start shouting out some of the elements of the power set of 1/2?  What's the right?  1 2  What up?  21 an ENT set  they're asking if that's that is equal to the power set of one and that's just the empty set and the set containing one.  And that's definitely now we can sort of see that that's definitely false. We got everything listed out in roster notation, very clear that these stats are the same and so is this going to happen for every example we can think of we have two examples now or this produces its overall claim is going to evaluate to true. I'm in the question is how can we be certain there? How can we argue that? This is actually going to happen for every single example we put in  This is a general approach. You can take when you when you encounter these proofs which is to say, I'll try some examples if I can't find a counterexample. Let's start a proof and see if I can come up with a convincing argument. So that's the next step here. So if we're going to try and prove this true, we're believing that it's true and we're going to try and prove it true are proven that start with universal generalization and we're going to have to say this is our to show up here and we're going to stay by Universal generalization.  choose a and b as  as arbitrary elements  W or from W so A and B are sets and their stats that are in the power set. W.  and there's a couple things we can try we can try next the most direct thing to try next is this idea that our current to show would be  Power set of a bullet power set of B implies a equals B here to use. Is this a bye direct proof?  Are to show is a equals B, and we get to assume that the power set of a equals the power set of be sure to try this proof on your own. There is a nice way to make this work, but I want to demonstrate another way to do this proof that I think is more.  Let's see when we wrote this first example, and we saw that the conclusion was true that these the sets were equal. It was pretty obvious that we're going to take the same arguments in the equal power sets. Only wrote this first example, there's another way to do this. So I'm going to leave this as a  Try this out. Try this right proof out, but I'm going to demonstrate a different proof technique here.  So are to show is currently this implication.  and  there's a nice use of just a logical equivalences we can do here to say that we can actually turn this into assuming that Q is false and using that as something assumption to show the PS4 that's kind of like rewriting this into not April B implies not power set of a equals power set of B.  That's actually a logical equivalence prewriting strategy has this name of proof of conditional by using the contrapositive because that's the that's the rewriting we're doing.  I'm so we can rewrite our to show this way and say what we're going to do. Is this actually I want to say this in two ways.  This we can stay by logical equivalence cuz these are logically equivalent another way we could write this is just by saying.  Fire Contra proof by contraposition of a conditional are new to show is the negation of the Assumption.  And we get to assume.  The negation of the conclusion to assume that not proof. We use this new rule that says we have an implication. We're going to assume the negation of the conclusion and prove the negation of a hypothesis when we get out of this is now our evidence that sing we assume is is not able to be we get to assume this negation some really good evidence to work with if two sets are equal.  when you take a minute just talk for 10:20 seconds to come up with any questions you have so far any questions you have so far about the  any questions come up so far happy so far. Yeah.  The definition of contrapositive for four conditionals is to just negate. That's just what contrapositive means on a conditional statement.  It's like I don't know. I mean there's like the inverse and the converse and I need to go listen to get the contrapositive and I don't know all of the reasons why those words were chosen, but this is the definition of contrapositive is negating negating flip in a conditional.  So now we get to assume that a is not equal to B and we have this goal of showing at the power steps aren't equal what we can get out of this not a equals B statement and we can expand the definition of set equality here. And what we get is the negation of the set equality definition and set equality definition says for all x x is in a if and only if x is in feet.  That's why I just took the definition of set equality that's defined on the sheet. Just expanded that definition in place here for a and b.  And from this we can do a little bit of logical equivalence rewriting here. And this says that there exists an X so that it's not true that X has an a  if and only if taxes in D.  Under the knife of logical equivalence that we can do it again and make this very nice and clean to read where the negation of a biconditional is the same as X or so, we can say that X has an A or exclusively x's and be so it's it's definitely going to be in Hindi.  One of those two things is true.  So again, I'm just doing logical equivalences rewriting here so we can be so that I can get a phrase that I have a way of writing us that I really like. So X exist in and X is knotting be  Or X is not in a and X isn't be.  Do things have to be true?  When they can't both be true.  That's pretty cool. So now I'm going to start Eminem use a new name and say we're going to pick up this element. We know some elements exists with this property is this statement means we got that we rewrote our assumption to say there exists an element that looks like that.  What why?  And we know that this is true of why I'm doing this just to be clear when I have this exists statement as an assumption working with why I kind of like it's a value that I'm going to be able to use another place. It's like I can talk about a set containing y and I can talk about other operations on why because I know that poops cuz I know that one of them ones that's why must exist.  Summit sister  Eminem blow this I just want to remind us of what we're trying to show.  our current goal is to show  a way to think about proof swimwear in the middle of them is where all these assumptions were making an approved right now the green stuff at the bottom, but why be an element with this property is currently our assumption. I've done the work to rewrite our assumption about a knot equals me into this statement in one set and not the other set and what we're trying to show we can prove that the power sets aren't equal.  There's this funny business where we have an order here and we would like to basically be proving that this or implies. This conclusion is trying to say is that if we have this there's one more proof idea we can use here which works when we have this these kinds of assumption that case. It's basically that foreman or we know that one of several things as possible and if we can prove that any one of those things that justifies the conclusion that we have in mind, then we can justify the conclusion. We know some or statement.  If we can show that all of the different parts of a door.  Satisfy the conclusion imply the conclusion then we can conclude that conclusion that we want. So if we can show two things one thing we need to show is that why in a and why not in b  implies not power set of a equals power set of B.  And then another thing we need to show is that why not in a and Y in b  Implies the same thing.  Msad has called proof by cases saying look, we're in a world where one of several possible things is true. We have to demonstrate that conclusion and then we can say well no matter which one is true. We know that the conclusion is going to be true. Sometimes we could imagine having an assumption that look has many or isn't it and we would have to extend this out. In this case. We have exactly two two parts of the or in the assumption.  We know we have some employees within our goal is to show this negation. Our goal is to show this negation.  this negation is  I can be expanded again using the definition of set equality we can say for all and I mean use a capital x here because I want to use capital letters for sets to be clear that the thing. I'm going to pick you as a set saying.  Act is in the power set of a  biconditional X is in the power set of B. That's the definition of set equality there.  Pacific Banning a definition and we have why in a and why not in b  Dealing with an implication here. And when we want to show an implication we can use direct proof so we can say that are to show in this case. Is this right hand side of the implication?  Am I get suicune?  That's why I exist and why not in b  interesting  So we're trying to show a we're trying to show the negation of after all and we have some assumptions. We have some evidence. We have some evidence. What's the next step?  All right. So what's a possible next step or go Largo looks like the negation of a fur all so what would we use when we want to prove the negation of aperol?  Yeah.  Look at that we could push the negation inside and turned into a witness other ways of saying that cuz that's one way of saying it what are other ways of saying this proving the negation of aperol.  starts with a C  rhymes with announcer example  witness also means we could look for a counterexample. So what we should show here is if we could choose.  something  as a counterexample.  Right. We'd like to choose some specific value that we can fill in for Capital ex then demonstrates with that body is false and we need to pick a specific value. Demonstrate that body is false. And now all we know about A and B. Is there some arbitrary set that came from w we don't know anything about A&D. Other than that, they are elements. What's a good value to pick here that we could use as a counterexample value to picture?  the set containing why  so the set containing why?  Are there any other ideas to take other ideas first?  would empty sepideh counterexample  yes, Keep On Keepin On  oh, that's interesting. So that is true for being a bad idea for kind of the reason you're saying for this claim. There are places like that if we tried to say something like there is an element in the set F then s being empty set example for it, right that is going to be in the power set of mini sets a and Minnie said being so we might in fact reduce true and we might not be a good counterexample work because of this particular cleaning up our sets, turns out in this case this why is that is useful, there might be other ones that could work and we have to push them through but this that containing just why is pretty useful  Weekends are our new goal to be to show that.  This is true. So the negation of this body with why filled in so why?  in the power set of a if and only if  Why?  in the power set  Abby  So I just took the suggested counterexample done the same thing with the different set and we would still have to demonstrate that. This claim is end up evaluating to true so that we know that it's a counterexample, but we picked this set containing Justice element y  This is kind of interesting because we can talk about what it means for y to be in the power set of a at War for why to be in the power set of be with the assumption that we have in this case, so I want to highlight this assumption.  This information that we know about why?  and so why is an element has a soul by the definition of power sets the set containing why must be in the power set of a we know that Y is an element of a  is true in this is true by definition of power set because  oops, because we know that Y is an element of a  And that's one of our assumptions. We know the way.  also  By the way, power sets defined.  Why can't be in the power set of B?  Because why isn't an element to beat?  And so there's no way that said containing y could be a subset of B, which would be what it would need to be true for it to be an elemental that power set.  Little bit of information that we got in this case is enough to be in the power set of B.  And that because of the subsets the sun setting in the definition of power set definition.  So that means we can rewrite this.  Claim as a why the second inning why in the power set of a that's true.  And the other claim is false.  We're trying to prove the negation of this cool. So true if and only if false evaluates the fall so this whole claim evaluates to true.  And definitions off at least this case so that finishes off this first case if we call this case one.  In case two is going to be exactly the same argument just with this the by definition of power set why in the power set of a day is fall and by definition of power set the set containing why is in the power set of B is true but will end up with a different false. If and only if true in the second to last stop the argument will be exactly the same just using the evidence in the the opposite way.  And so what this what this argument is saying is that's worth equal. We could always find some element.  Within one of the steps and not in the other set and show that I can be different across the two power sets. The power sets can be equal.  So here, why did Arie right to get to this basically?  So I really need to get to this because the structure of this problem requires finding a counterexample for the right hand side. If we pick this purse technique for negating the conclusion and then trying to prove the negation of a hypothesis. We're trying to find a counterexample and rewriting by logical equivalence to something that's in exists makes it clear that we have some elements will work with right and so that exists is the thing that makes it a good argument to say there is some why and I can always talk about this particular element with these properties and then I rewrote it to Anor because really there's two ways that the fruit kind of goes for any particular example, I do you plug in values for A and B for this example like Pacific set.  Some elements it's not even be but maybe he has some elements overlap and we need to be able to do either one of those arguments because A or B could be a subset of one another and then we need to pick the element. It's like the odd one out. And so we need that or to describe those two possible scenario.  certain question other questions about this  That's a great question. So the question is it doesn't seem property A&B were from this restricted domain of w in order to do this proof an impact. Mainly I did that in this proof that we could be really clear about specific examples because this property is true for all kinds of domains that we could pick instead of w true for all kinds of domain so we can pick instead of puppy. So I made it. I made it be really specific because it helped us think about these examples, but this is much more general property of Injustice. Nothing special about these numbers 1 2 3 4 5 that makes this is true for many many domains.  This is true for sets containing like any of the values we talked about in this class so far whether their colors are DNA strands.  questions about this proof questions about this  So we used we use third of all the first techniques we know so far to do this proof. We did Universal generalization. We use this new idea of assuming the negation of the conclusion is contrapositive idea is direct proof inside these cases and we use proof by cases to use the or to conclude something.  And we get a pretty convincing argument with this statement. This statement is in fact true and some just going to make a note here that this was would be case too and we could say something like  and I'm just going to say similar argument.  2 case 1  using pee in a sorry using  why not exist in the power set of a but why is an element of the power set of B, which is just a flippable. We had a buff.  I want to review this song Caesar Cipher question for the rest of the class.  And I want to make a few things.  Symbolic that weren't necessarily symbolic in the definition in the homework. So just to refresh your memory and all these definitions are in the back side of the pressure memory. There was this idea that letters can be in these different categories of, medium. And Caesar Cipher is were these tickets are these functions that would talk about taking a letter shifting it by a certain amount and then producing a new letter that was the key idea of the Caesar Cipher is talking about shifting a letter. So it has the number in an input and output letter.  Then there's these three other products to tell us LCL M&L are going to be a little more specific than one of these categories and then there's this elk a predicate that's trying to express these two letters are different and not in the same category. So the first question I want to ask us to work with this symbolic Hellcat definition. Some of the pieces inside is which of these claims a B and C are true, which of these propositions end up being true and they're using is lclm and biconditionals on specific letter Z the J are specific letters. So which of those are true statements?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, freaking again clicking again. So is also a bit of review of a biconditional means is 10th is actually the real reason I'm asking this specific question.  5 4 3 2 1  so we can look at this first one which is saying be is common a common letter if it only if Z is a common letter letter. If and only if Z is a common letter actually doesn't help me that much understand what's going on here. Do this one. I think we can ask is is Elsie of be true?  Is b a common letter know and neither is z?  So we end up with false if and only if false and this is true false, if and only if false evaluates to true the biconditional says that the values of the same like the negation of X are both our faults than biconditional Valu evaluate. The truth is a true statement. It is a truth is one of these that's true is a  The next question is is be a medium frequency letter. If and only if J is a medium frequency letter.  Well, that's a true for B. It is medium medium frequency and a false for Jay because Jay is rare. And so this evaluates the false.  So this isn't true.  And then this last case we're asking if B is common. If and only if B is coming in again that's going to be a fall.  and if all that evaluates to true  I'm so there were two of these that evaluates to true that in biconditionals. We're really looking for this matching Behavior. So the values being the same and I will see now that will do an example with Hellcat next putting these together actually is the right thing to put together for the statements are true hear these statements about El Cap.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, and so here what's happening is for this first one for BB this ends up being false. But only because of this part of the elk a predicate elk a predicate. What about you ate the truth would evaluate the truth because in this case we'd end up with false. If and only if false true if and only if true and false if and only if false so you get true true true for these pieces with the letters are equal because it's all an aunt is not true.  So be is true.  because intuitively being why are in the same category here and we should think about why this ends up working out for be and why we end up with just the medium case with true implies true if and only if true  This ends up being true this ends up being false. If and only if false this ends up being false if and only if false so we have for truth and it together for this case conditional is making sure that the letters really are in the same category. If they're in different categories. One of these would end up producing false does not work cuz they're in A & B are in different categories. So end up with one of these mismatching and get a false for one of these.  Hellcat predicate ends up usefully describing  this idea that the numbers are at the letters are in the same category and not equal to each other and that was a big part of the definition of of the cipher being secure. So the last thing that I want to do as a last question because once we do this picking the counterexample actually ends up being pretty straightforward but getting the property written down is useful for the last thing I want to have up here is which one of these represents this property of being secure where the property was that whenever the Caesar Cipher shifts a letter. It doesn't produce the same letter and it produces a letter that's in the same category that idea Caesar Cipher produces new letter that's in the same category for every letter. "
