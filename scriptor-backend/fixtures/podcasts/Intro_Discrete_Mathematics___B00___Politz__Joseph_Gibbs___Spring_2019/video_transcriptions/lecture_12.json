I'm in midterms going to be next Wednesday evening. And we're going to be posting just six of that about that. I'm just some things. I want to make sure you know, if you can use a note card for notes for the exam will post like Dimensions. If you really want to know number of inches in The Piazza post. So it's posted in one place for notes and material on it is up to Monday's lecture. So including this week Mondays lecture, which was April 22nd. And today I will be posting some practice questions. So we wrote up some practice questions kind of in the style of like homework warm-up kinds of questions that are things you should  Spectre review to be ready for the exam and there will be assigned seats in the exam and you can look on the website for the time and room the exam is 7 to 9 p.m. On Wednesday evening. And you can look online for the room the corresponds to the section not say details in class just so I don't accidentally say something wrong and then being consistent with a p at the post. So give me one place where all this information goes.  The let's see. And also if you're thinking about exams it worth reading the exam policy grading policy for exam grading and determine the final go together to come to the midterm exam next Wednesday night.  So let's talk about doing some more proof. So what we what we started talking about on Wednesday.  What is how to do some proofs of universal statements being true or existential statements being false statement being true? And we use this strategy called Universal generalization where we picked an arbitrary elements in the domain and use only that assumption to show that the predicate was true. And we actually know a little bit about logical equivalence existentials we can use to prove that X Essentials are false that tell us how to negate an existential and that's something that we're going to see in use today, but I want to start by talking about a few properties of Numbers number going to go back to talking about DNA for a little bit and we're going to prove some more for all statements and some for all statements in an interesting way.  The property I want to bring up on Wednesday in the idea with factoring is that we're talking about integers where they're evenly divided by some other integer or pairs of integers that multiply together to produce another integer. I were talking about this relationship between integers and we describe for all statements or exist statement is we want to restrict the domain that are even or just the integers that are in a certain rain is reasonable things 100. Those are things that we like to say. It's worth seeing how does play out when we translate them.  Into some of the notation we've been using so we're going to use this predicate that is this predicate of a number having exactly two positive factor for an integer having exactly two positive factors and we're going to think about how we can restrict domain and positive integers further and if it helps us true depending on how we restrict the domain, so the first the first question here is which of these options in this blank to make the statement true, which of these five options could be interesting to think about if there's more than one of them or not, and I have a definition of prime at the bottom. So the D make sense here for D being  5 4 3 2 1  I'm just got this one just briefly just briefly.  Okay, so I'm not going to have you pick it again. I just wanted to give you a chance to talk about this for a second the most popular answer here was defense since I have the definition of prime which says positive integers only positive factors of this idea is talking about only factors being one in p how can we make the statement true of having exactly two positive factors seem like they go together any of the others here true as well. If any of the others to make this trip into statements an invitation we've been using and talk about a potential examples for the other cases because there's some interesting counterexamples here.  I'm the first one was this extra constraint that and is less than 4 and so when we restrict the domain with these for all statements that these are all statements that say for all positive integers for all and that are from the set of positive integers. We've been using Z Plus to refer to the positive and above.  And we might try and add something here. Maybe like maybe we want sum notation like  Less than four, maybe we try and fit it in there and there's several ways. We could try and write new notation to express this idea that we're restricting this domain to just the numbers that are less than four but it turns out in this was a few lectures ago. It turns out there's a way to express this with the other logical forms. We already have and when we have a for all statement that restricts the domain we can always express the restricted domain as we can say that we want the body here to be in less than 4  Implies, then I wrote this a predicate on your sheet as defined as T that and has exactly two positive factors. That's the predicate we were talking about on the front. So this is a reminder on on the slide here t a t event is  and has two positive factors.  Exactly two positive factors. The key idea here is that we can take this restricted domain is restricted domain statement that Anne has to be less than 4 and in a fur all we can put that in front of an implication and that actually will Express the restricted domain for us.  So this is a translation of that first statement into the notation were used to so there is some number in the positive integers and it has to be less than 4 and for all of those we're going to have this property that has exactly two positive factors examples times answer over this. We should have some counterexample  I'd shows that this isn't true. So what's a counterexample of this we want to prove it false?  one interesting  So the suggestion is the N equals one is a counterexample to this.  Oh, yeah, how many of you start with a kind of nice case to think about here where the entire set of numbers that end could be here is 1/2 in three in the case where this the left hand side of the implication is true. Those are only the number one have any other factors that we can multiply together to get to one if we're talking about?  Buy all of the things we can multiply together to get to one. Well in terms of just what we know about integer arithmetic. The only solution is here for the factors that we might pick for AMC are going to be one that has to do with the definitions of integer arithmetic.  Interesting. Okay. So one is a counterexample here.  because  the only  And really it is right. The only positive factors of one is or are one and we can talk about justifying that statement in a lot more detail to what would you try and say to me to tell me about The only positive factors of 1 is it a hard one? Like how do you justify that part of this clean?  Express it in any other way.  Yeah, how would you justify add approve it?  Set up an equation.  Yeah, the only thing you can do that as once that sort of high-level argument I made with one equal daytime see which is there any other way you could try expressing this using the ideas. We have like exists and for all the way we can talk about that.  All you deserve to have not won.  Interesting interesting. Let me try and express this. I'm not going to go through a whole discussion of this property. Just cuz I want to is a few things I want to discuss here. But you said something like a million paraphrasing what you said, but you said something like we could express this as and let me call this and I'm actually just so we don't get it confused with n if there.  Not equal to one.  Then they can't possibly be a factor of 1.  In the factor of one predicate is the one that says we can find some number to x m that equals 1 and you're saying that's never going to happen if m is not equal to one and that would be the state no more. We can start pushing through the algebra. We drive to say well there's going to be this exists inside the factoring predicate and we showed there can't possibly exist such an integer through if we weren't willing to take this idea of the only positive factors one being one at face value expressive and push it all the way through.  So that was that the discussion of how to do.  And this would be sort of.  depending on  How much were willing to take for granted about integers in that property about multiplication and factoring for integers? We may need to be working in a context where we have enough algebra assumptions that were willing to make that that we can take for granted that we can have as an assumption.  So what about be so be above said?  I get that up against a b above said that is non negative as the constraint. So here we have for all in in the Plus.  And our extra constraint would be that n is greater than or equal to 0.  Empty the extra clips extra constraint here.  a good counter examples for this  4  same forwards and interesting counterexample or to match the format above you're saying and equals 4 is an interesting counterexample example.  The evidence that four is a counterexample. How do you justify that 4 is a counterexample?  4/2 factor is 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 so you're saying because  and equals 2 * 2 + n equals 1 times for Olive to 1 and 4 are numbers that we can use as factors for n  And if we were talking about our factoring predicate from the last lecture we might say by definition of factoring.  and one thing I want to point out here is we don't have any argument that says these are the only factors of 4 we kind of know it like we can tell as humans used to dividing numbers by one another that the only factors of 4 are those are the only factors about number three factors exist say here is since an has at least  3 factors  it can't  have exactly two.  Demonstrate is a counterexample given evidence that it has more factors than what the predicate requires.  Setia band can't be true and the constraint was true.  Look at the fur see that's greater than 3 we've already we already have a great counterexample. So the claim and see was for all and in the positive integers if an is greater than or equal to 3.  That is exactly two positive factors. And there's a counterexample here we can just use for again. We couldn't use one again cuz it wouldn't satisfy the constraint that is greater than or equal to 3/4 again for would be a good counter example here because that's the prime one that we're going to have to come back to and talked about doing it showing that a true and he had no extra constraints. So this would just be for all end that are positive integers T of n is true.  I'll be that statement examples for that Casey.  How many samples for e?  We reuse either 4 or 1.  Could use for again because this again this actually Ian be me and the saying they're going to be true at the same time because that any greater than or equal to 0 constraint in be this constraint is it's extra. There's no way that this could ever be fault because Anne is already a positive integer is really just an extra part of this expression that makes it that it would be logically equivalent to eat.  so we are have been taking Z + 2 mean the positive integers like starting at 1 so  because it's not part of the domain. Yeah, so is this x it's a it's like a we could also say and is greater than or equal to negative 5 and as long as we have a definition of greater than equals, dates positive numbers and negative numbers in the setting we're working and we get the same behavior.  But actually can come into play in the proof by Universal generalization because you might pick something from the domain and then realize that part of the predicate you're trying to show it being in the domain, right? So we were just trying to prove the claim for all and that are in the positive integers and is greater than or equal to 0 the claim overall. We could use actually for this one either would work.  We could use one or four with someone.  So those four possible answers all have counterexamples, right? So none of those were true.  And the answer most of you gave and that is interesting to talk about being true. Is this other one that for all positive integers and if and his Prime and that's I wrote that as the predicate are on your feet and that's how I abbreviated it. If n is prime then it must have exactly two positive factors against using that idea of restricting the domain written as an implication inside of her all.  This is what we would like to show and so we sort of believe this is true. At least the vast majority of you believe. This is true. When you are answering the question and I agree with you to demonstrate that this is true. So we have and we're going to use this new fact that's on the right and it's the new new property that's listed at the top of your sheet to do a little bit of work to get there. So we have it for all claim. The claim is that there's some for all so one of the things we can start by doing is saying  Bye.  And this is not the property that's on the right. This is just the same thing. We used at the end of last class.  We can pick and we can say it. Let me be some arbitrary elements going to be a positive integer from the domain and then we have a new thing to show.  We have to show that.  This implication is true.  So we started with this claim and Universal generalization with this extra something that we have a particular element is that it's a positive integer so far.  And now we're going to use this other this other proof techniques here where we can prove an implication by assuming the hypothesis is true and using that assumption as evidence to demonstrate the conclusion know there's a part of this that is needs to be justified a little bit through strategy. If the hypothesis is fall then we know that the whole implication evaluate the fault. So there's no evidence. We need to generate in that no further Evidence. We need to generate in the case for the hypothesis is false an argument or more evidence is about hypothesis is true because in that case we need to demonstrate that the conclusion will always be true for the whole statement to be true using this property of implication.  a case where the hypothesis is true that say and this is  this will be named on a future slide, but I'm going to name it. I'm going to name it here.  Buy direct proof of a conditional or by direct proof of an implication and what we can do is assume.  That already is true.  And then we need to show.  That TV is true using any information that's available information about me being prime or RV being true.  So we get to make this assumption.  And now we're going to use that information to say something about the exactly two positive factors.  existing 4E approve t  And so I'm because RV is is true.  Right by the definition of prime or by the definition of RV being true. We know a couple things isn't sure that's Prime must be greater than one definition of prime says he must be greater than 1  that's the first part of the Prime definition and the other part of the Prime definition says if the only positive factors of that number are 1 and itself  There's just one bit of extra justification needed to go from this evidence to the conclusion. The predicate TV that has exactly two factors. It's worth pointing out that  Since he is greater than 180 definitely does not equal 1.  Paint is definitely not the same as once which was the only evidence we had about this number didn't tell us that it wasn't equal to one we could end up with the same situation. We ended up in with the counter example for a few of the earlier the earlier claim but since its prime, we know that it's greater than one that's part of the definition of prime. That's where we get some evidence that tells us that he's not one. So he's some number that is greater than 1 and it's only factors are in one.  So we know that they are two different.  factors  And since the definition of prime says that they're the only ones we get to just use that information from the definition of prime cuz we're assuming it by this director of strategy.  Money has exactly these two factors.  So he must be true in this case and that ends the proof because we finished showing the last thing we needed to show the last thing we had this TV 50 of a demonstration.  Any information from Prime along with you being a positive integer? Let us let us conclude this.  so  One of my light one or two more things in different color. So where we said use that assumption that's really us sort of collecting all of this information out of the definition of primeness.  And where we say showing Q is true down here. We put together this new in this new evidence. We have and finally demonstrate that this just final part. So that's where were using the different pieces of that definition.  Big questions about the structure of this thing as you were surprised that came up or think should have come up with didn't talk about it for a minute, questions you have about this this description of his justification about a permit.  Okay questions about this questions about this.  questions or comments comments welcome to  I think that was asking what is QED mean if I heard right somewhere. I think I heard that question come up. I'll forget the Latin off the top of my head. So this is where we pronounce it wrong. So let's say I was getting new window up.  What does QED mean?  Don't be afraid to ask it's a quad s demonstrandum I think but it's going that middle Iowa can't count to get the middle word. What it means is in the English translation translation. Is that which was to be demonstrated?  Saying that I said in my proof demonstrates the original goal of the proof. So basically this matters in the sense that it doesn't really matter. If you write the word QED it matters that you write something that says the last thing that ties the knot in finishes the proof or is the last piece of evidence. We need to finish the proof. So often drawn is a little square at the end of a proof either field in her Halo. There's a little square at the end of the proof in that is like a symbol at the end of proof that will mean QED or we're done now. This was a lasting to demonstrate.  What are questions questions?  so I want to move on to another application where we're still going to be working on this idea of proving things with withdrawals and existential and so for this one what I want to do is start with  Play an English sentence and turn it into the statement that we're going to try to prove and I think the English sentence we can probably agree that it's saying something true. So the English sentences, there is no DNA strand as it starts with a c c and doesn't start with a  Will never be able to find a DNA strand that starts with ATC but doesn't start with a I think we can all agree. This is true. And I want to make sure we agree that our goal is to show that these things are true as we go forward with Bruce will be able to use them to discover things. That might be surprising but I think it's unsurprising. So the first question is how would we express this in terms of universal and existential and then we can work on demonstrating that proof?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay Quicken again clicking again.  5 4 3 2 1  so the a part of this thing I want to highlight is the there is no part of this in English and sort of another way to say there is no is there does not exist and they're does not exist is going to map really well today and 2D which says there does not exist a strand and this is different from saying there's some DNA strand such that some property isn't true. This is different than saying there. Is this the DNA strand where a property is is false or not true. This is saying there doesn't exist. Any none of them are going to be able to satisfy the property. And so that's that. Translation can guide us towards A&D here.  Matches English pretty well as it starts with a d c and doesn't start with a there's a conjunction here. There's a negation here for the doesn't start with a and so this matches really well Indie is the representation. I would pick for the sentence here. I mean just matches extremely well sort of a direct translation. It's worth pointing out that this implication is not logically equivalent to the end here. We can just say that those are necessarily logically equivalent in this case, so it sucks.  There is a difference between this and here we talked about this a little bit that existentials with would be true for every DNA strand. That doesn't start with a t c be true for all of those DNA strands those would all be on Witnesses for the existential. But in this case with the conjunction if the strands doesn't start with a TCF in the whole conjunction is false, so there's a distinction there.  Okay, so let's talk about let's talk about proving this claim. So and I want to set up for this is I'm going to step through several rules that we would use in order to break this down into pieces that can be demonstrated by exactly the rules. We've seen so far original claim if we pick to use the representation, which I think is a good representation of this is that there is no es.  That's a strand.  I wear patc of s is true and Pa abbess is false starts with a c and Pa is starts with a  and the first thing we're going to do with this is say well, we're trying to prove the negation of an existential and we know that the proven existential fall. One of the things we can do is turn it into a for all statement and then use Universal generalization on the fur all the same sort of choosing elements in the domain strategy so we can stay  Why does logical equivalence?  It would be also sufficient to show that for all ass.  It's not true that patc about us and not PA of us. And this is using this property here that when we have the negation of an existential we can move the negation inside and change it to a so thanks, there does not exist for all of the X is not the avexis true.  so that gives us a new goal and it's a new Google where we have a strategy for that kind of cool when we have a for all kind of proof goal or to show we can use this idea of  picking an arbitrary element. I want to be really explicit about something as I stepped through this particular proof, which is that we keep getting these intermediate goals and I'm labeling every intermediate what is phrase to show and the idea with each of these intermediate goals is it if we can satisfy these intermediate explained that we had before would be true as well. So if we can show the disc for all statement is true, then the original goals are for all we know that for all we can try and use Universal generalization. So by Universal generalization,  let  from the set  being arbitrary elements  of the domain and now the new thing we have to show.  Is this internal statement with e?  With the assumption that you use some specific value, but all we know about it is that it's a DNA strand.  Sonu Google we have another thing marked with to show here.  And now this doesn't match any of our strategy. We don't have a strategy for proving negations of ants it is not something we use for that. We could try a true. That's one thing we can try and do we can try and grab the definition of a PC and a and maybe we do is maybe a tautology or something like that might be one strategy we could take what I'm going to do for for this example is that we do know something and it's kind of what we're learning today. We do know something about proving that implications are true. There's this new strategy of this direct proof of conditional. So if we could make this look like a conditional then we could use that strategy to prove it and assuming that he starts with a t c seems like a useful step to take in this proof.  I was trying to make this look like a conditional.  So we can take a couple steps of logical equivalence here into a form that looks like a conditional and then we can apply a Technique we know.  so  Biological equivalence. Well, we can use demorgan's law this bottom one is called demorgan's law.  and we can rewrite this as  Not p8ece or not, not PA of e so, I just put the extra not in front of the knob PA. So applied to Morgan's law.  And we could even label that specific rule that we use to reply that we can talk about the negation of the negation being equal to the predicate inside. So buy some more logical equivalences.  We can make this look like not p a t c of e or p a e.  And we have a logical equivalence the relationship between this kind of expression and implication.  And we can get this implication up.  So I had to know when I was thinking about this proof that I could reach for the logical equivalences when I had some compound proposition and rewrite the compound proposition treating the predicate says things that I leave alone. I'm not looking inside the predicates right now. I'm just rewriting this these propositional operations where I have a pro strategy I can use and so this last statement is now another thing that I could show to justify the entire chain of proof. I set up so far then biological equivalent.  Next goal is to show that this is true.  And that's when we get to use our new rule.  That we can have this direct proof on conditionals. And so  We can assume.  That P A T C of E.  Is true and then we have a new to show.  Which is finally just as predicate PA if that's our last the last thing we're going to try and show here and the evidence we get from assuming that patc is true by the definition.  of p8ece  he starts.  with  ATC the predicate definition definition. That means he starts with a t c.  Based on this specific definition of saying he's starts with a t c we can think about you and some other in some interesting ways. For example, we know that he must look like a B1 B2 B3.... Bien. It's a DNA strand and that be one must be equal to a 2 must be equal to T & B 3 must be equal to see what it means to start with.  ATC so this is the kind of evidence we get out of that if we assume that means that we have available in this case. The one that's going to be incredibly useful is this one right? That be one is equal to applied to applied to a DNA strand. I'm just going to write it down here you have it on your but if you look at the definition of PA of  ass it says B1 equals a  Where are sequels B1... Bien that's the definition of evidence. We need to demonstrate the PA is true. For eat. We know that this be one is equal to A & E.  So we could even say by definition of p a of E.  All we have to show is that b is that?  Let me use two different letters here to be really clear.  I'm going to say see one must be be one.  Must be equal to a is it to show?  Merrigan were using this idea that we can break up into these b-1b ends at pitc is true.  and now the whole chain of reasoning we can think about going all the way back is evidence that B1 equals a demonstrates that I must be true for this input e  That tells us that in all the cases where patc is true PA is true. So this entire implication must always be true because in all the cases were the hypothesis is true with that information. We can demonstrate that the conclusion will be true. If that's true. Then by all of these logical equivalences. This original negation is true. If negation is true. Then we can say that by the universal generalization we can get this for all statement and aperol statement is logically equivalent to the original existential. We used all of these different pieces. We've built up for demonstrating proved to get a drill down into this statement to show that the the first base being a + 18 is enough evidence to show that the first break apart these statements.  We need inside the originals. "
