    "Full Transcript": "Alright, let's get started. so  what we talked about what we talked about on Wednesday remind me what we talked about on Wednesday. What are we doing Wednesday?  What is that? What is that?  What we talked about what? Yeah, go ahead.  1 * 1 + 2 * 24  Binary, what would 4 in binary we talked about last Friday to representations for negative numbers logic gates. We talked a little bit about how we can take some of these operations that we might want to do. We talked a little bit about some of these operations we wanted to do I'm binary numbers. I've been putting them into putting him into the about symbolic representation of some of these ones and zeros interpreted not just as numbers, which is what we've been doing so far, which is another kind of reasoning we're going to need to do I'm just as a quick reminder want to make sure I because we have all these deadlines in this class. I want to make sure I'm listening everytime. We have a deadline the homework for homework 1  Going to be due Monday night and last night the follow-up zero and warm up for one of the other warm up or do so, I just want to be clear that Thursday night. Those deadlines are happening and that homework, that's out. We put that on Monday is going to be due next Monday evening.  But what a quick just put up a slide that we had up on on Wednesday. I mean this was one of our first examples of doing doing a logic circuit like this. And so we had these two inputs that we talked about x 0 & Y 0 and we had these two outputs want and I said the grass was representing some and see was representing the carry in the idea was that we had to represent all that information. And so I just want to draw an S for one second to talk about the relationship between some of these inputs and outputs that come out on Wednesday. And so I just want to be clear back to 0 & Y 0  And so we can locate those rows in these tables on the right hand side of the Rose where X 0 & Y 0 0 and 1 and then we can read off what's happening for a 0 which is the result of this xor gate and that produces of one because these values are these values are different in this table is showing us that this gate is producing these women values.  And we can also look at this row and see that what'll happen in here when we have the zero and one for the input is it will get a zero coming out to the Kerry. So I just really what I wanted to do here is just visually map what's going on in these tables. We saw on to the circuit diagram where we left off on Wednesday when we were talking about doing more and more Edition cycada adding more than one bit because this is talking about the one bit some I'm actually going to hold off on showing that there's some things I want to talk about with some other small example, and we might be an example of a few other small examples first today.  I'm with this in mind. I want to bring up some of these some of these some interesting pictures that we can draw with some of these Gates even if we just have one one input variable this also get that some things that we can draw allowed to draw circuits Sony's two pictures on the bottom left, but I have is a single input variable called X and then X the the wire coming out of X has been split and there's two inputs going into a gate into input. I'm going into an xor gate and both of those inputs are going to have the value of x variable is going in both of the input City's Gates. So what I want you to think about what is the truth table and uploading like or what is the input output table end up looking like  Table word is a where we're going to start using today. I'm pretty used to offer these two simple Gates. What is the table look like for these two simple case.  All right. So let's talk through let's talk through these two cases because they're actually going to give us some interesting insights that we can use to build up some larger thing.  So in the first case we have X's the input and an X. The input is being used as both of the input and gate. So if x is 1 if x is one then there's the two inputs coming into the end. We can consult the and table that we have at the top and see if both are one coming into the end.  And similarly if both values are zero, which is going to happen if we duplicate this x we get to zero here.  For the xor gate if he input his act. What's the what's the output according to this table? If you if he put X's one, what's the output according to this table?  Going to be zero because we're going to end up insulting that top row in the x or table just throw in the extra table. We're both values AR-10 will consult his bottom row. We're both of the valley is coming under 0  So mainly this picture is useful for us notation only because when we have these logic circuits, we will be doing this operation to take the wire for some variable split it and use it as in multiple places and we are allowed to use it use those multiple inputs as inputs to say the same day like this and an xor gate a couple of interesting questions to play with these life logic circuit. And so the first question this is a question that's directly on your hand out is why whose output is always zero and one one thing to think about is can you do it with just one gate? There's also ways to do it with more than one gate with exactly one of the gates. So try this try drawing out drawing out a little logic circuit this going to always put in always producing your own a matter of the values of X and Y and has these two inputs X and Y.  Yeah, I just want to hear from you.  Alright, so any suggestions for how to do this? No matter how many gates really looking for one gate one game solution first. I'm suggestions. The people had yeah.  So two branches from one value going to an exclusive or gate interesting. I think you're suggesting of one game solution and tell me which value you want this putting topping on.  Okay.  United Seafood  I have like two exclusive or gate.  So maybe there's been maybe there's some chain process here. So I'm just going to undo a few of the lines that I drew and take more suggestions. Could I think that you were going to suggest a good to get solution and I think I saw some other people catching something like that. So when I get more sleep,  Okay.  But would have to be one.  Both are one then it wouldn't make that corrugated fault. And then so one of them without his wife.  Until I mean I did I did I draw what you intended. The first of all I didn't make any mistakes drawing what you intended and I'm going to use a little different language Euros instead of Truth and false has just cuz we're using ones and zeros for now, you made it is if we put X and Y into and the edge coming out of an ER the wire coming out of an end. This could only be one if X and Y were both one. So the only way this could be one as if X and Y were both one, but then they would produce a zero and then is final and would end up producing a zero and we could draw out the team and Trace through the circuit for all of this one works. I haven't done all the work to check it right, but I'm pretty sure this one works. It seems like that argument hangs together, but we have to do more checking to be sure.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then I'll go look.  So you can connect your saying the here's another idea is X and Y and you said connected to an and gate.  and then you said take the output of this and connect it to  that looks like a really cool spaceship. All right, so I knew said then connect both so we can take one of these wires split it in and put it in the in both of the input.  It wouldn't matter what the first gate is interesting.  It wouldn't matter what you're saying. I can take any gate in substituted in here interesting cuz you tell me more about that argument.  Yeah, so we so we sort of saw in the last slide that if we connect the same input up to an xor gate if we split input and connect it up to an xor gate we end up getting the I always getting 0 out of the xor gate because that same that's the same going to be the same value on both inputs. That's pretty interesting. So this idea of splitting it now that we've seen this  You want to suggest a solution that only uses one gate? Yeah.  At least with the gates at so you're saying you lose with the gates. We've seen so far. You don't see any Gates that has all zeros in the rightmost column, right? You don't see one of those so it's not their which one we could use. I want to give I want to give an answer to this that makes it feel like maybe this was a trick question.  Interesting. Okay. So you predicted the sort of answer that could turn this into feeling like a trick question, which is let's just not use Y and have X going into  and xor gate why doesn't why doesn't have isn't used as an input and output is described by the  interesting. That's a good question. So you're saying you want to draw a circuit where start of the wires from X and Y come together into one shared wire and then go into the xor gate so great question. So in these logic circuits that we're drawing the only way we can go from two values down to one is by using some kind of date to combine them gives us the rules for combining two wires together. Then we we need some rules to talk about what the value on that wire could be in the gates are the way that we reduce down trick answer to the version that just uses one input works because some parts of the circuit and it's interesting to talk about which parts of the input. We actually need to use or need to use for different parts of the circuit things.  Vista this isn't a question. I rafting in a total vacuum. It's actually useful for I'm building up some some larger and interesting circuit. So the next thing I want to talk about this drawing a logic circuit, it implements multiplication by 4 in 6 with finery and there's a little bit more information on the hand out about how to do this. The idea is to bits of input and output to represent the result of multiplying by 4 and 1/2 think about here is what the tables going to look like for this as you as you try to start building it up, but we do know that a big part of the construction here is that there's going to be an input for an input X10 next one and then 4 digits worth about what to represent this.  So think about this problem for a minute drying out a logic circuit that'll Implement multiplication by 4 that uses this structure. So filling in the gates in the middle on to do multiplication by for hot weather for men.  OK Google  So I hear some great questions going around. So I want to I want to give a few sort of helpful examples. I want you to keep thinking about this because there's two parts. This one is understanding basically how the problem in the structure is set up here the interpretation of what these wires and bits mean and then the other is building a circuit and so I want I want to give some some guidance in interpreting this problem. So there's these two input bits and I'm actually going to draw them in this order X1 and then x 0 because these are representing two bits of a weed through base 2 number and so for example, if we had 0 0 that would represent the number 0 we had zero one that would represent the number one if we had  1 0 that's representing the number two and one one is representing the number three with his two with binary representation.  And then we can talk about what we expect to get as the answer for those when multiplying by 4 so and then sort of spread across 0 through Z 3 or the digits 0 through XIII.  Descending order so that when we read them off at all look like a binary number. What's the what's the four bit result for multiplying 0 by 450 by 4.  All zeros all 0 so we should expect it. If we have 00 the output of the circuit ends up being 0 0 0 0  If we multiply 1 by 4, what do we expect as the output?  What do we expect the output to be as a decimal number just in the answer for arithmetic for right? And so we need to include that in these bits?  And actually we'll see if we do this out if we have 2 x 4 we would expect to get eight and if we have three x 4 we expect to get 12.  There's some structure here in the expected output of the circuit, which is that it's sort of moving these bits over in the second row e move 0 1 / 2 Z 3 + 2 + + z 1 + z 0 or zeroes. I'm in the same thing happened in the throes of the stable.  So that's pretty interesting. And also that's all the cases. There's no other values we can talk about for the inputs for X 0 and x 1. Those are the four cases that we need to think about circuit that has exactly those outputs for these influences what we need to build. So I want you to take another minute with this structure in mind continuing to try and build this up because this actually tells us a lot about what our goals are for building a circuit.  Okay, so I want to talk about this to get out of this circuit together now.  I see a lot of interesting ideas as I walk around and there's multiple ways to do this. So I'm going to show I'm going to show you a way that I think is reasonable to do this and I'm curious. I'm curious if this is what you tried or was on sort of the endpoint of a path that you were trying one thing. I want to observe right off the bat is that this comment about moving the values of x 0 and x 1 into the values of Z 3 + Z2 the value of x one ends up being the value of the 3 without changing at all. This doesn't this this input can go directly to this outfit.  x 0 always seems to go to  z20 always seems to end up in Z2, and then there's a question of what to get for Z 0 and Z 1 what we look at the the table Z 0 and Z Wonder always Eros. So that suggests we can use one of our ideas for producing consistency Rose here.  Reproducing consistency is here splitting this and producing an XR and that can be what goes into Z 0 and Z 1 so we always get with the X 0 and x 1 values move into the appropriate spot in the output.  Now, this is one approach for representing.  Chinese thing else if they want to share for representing the circuit.  Yeah.  See you later ask you to ask that again, cuz I'm not sure I understood the question.  I see. Yeah you're saying.  If we just drew nothing going into Z 0 and Z 1 for example, what's the answer? What's the interpretation of that circuit is a really good question. So this along with the wires are really good questions about this representation and we're going to choose in our representation in this is typical canonical choice for these terms of some input. And so that's that's going to force us to come up with some wire that goes into each of the output bits. And that's going to be a constraint on the way we draw these  The sort of a hardware reason why that is if you're good. If you have one of these I mean, you can't imagine building something that doesn't require that doesn't require this constraint that a wire goes into everything for consistency if we were talking about lots of for bit for bit and we were say then doing something with Z100 Z1 Z2 and Z3 off to the other side we would want I have sort of a contiguous diagram that actually Drew from the input all the way to those other output and so it's nice to have it always be in terms of those in Fort Myers.  So the question is if it's like a variable in code that's not initialize. I don't want to draw too strong of an analogy there because depending on the programming language were thinking of his actual different kinds of meaning for an initialize variable. So there's a sort of a light analogy that but I don't want to draw too strong an analogy there between uninitialized variables and and something that doesn't have any anything coming into it cuz we're going to define the way we draw these to say there have to be these wires coming into the output anyway. So in that case would be like having a programming language were you can't have one of these on this life? You always have to precisely specify it.  So this is this is an interesting interesting observations to take from multiplying by 4 really was a shifting operation on the representation of this number. So the X for what if we do we really shifted the bits over by two places that we shifted the values over by two places multiplied by 10 or a hundred or a thousand you shift the number over by a certain number of digits and then fill in with zeros from the right. And so this is just another one of these connections between what were used to in decimal arithmetic and arithmetic when we multiply by powers of 2, we're getting this shifting effect.  So any questions about the circus we've seen so far. I'm going to start talking about some some newer things next. And so I just want to ask any questions about the circuit seen so far other outstanding questions about how we draw these diagrams.  the meaning of these diagrams  sea of happy faces  So there is so we we did this exploration of circuits in part to motivate some of the representations we had four binary which lettuce demonstrate that the binary representation of the thing. We can build into a physical machine. If you believe me that these gates are things that we can build into a physical machine. We're not going to talk about that in detail in this course, there's wonderful courses in this department on architecture for understanding how to take these kinds of diagrams and turn them into a real machine, but I'm beyond expressing arithmetic. It turns out these Gates and some of the operations were talking about are also useful for expressing logical statements that say things about what's true and what's false knees are the same kinds of logical reasoning we have to do in a program to make decisions about what to do. And so one of the things we  Going to be exploring we're going to use gates to explore the first we're also going to start to use Expressions to explore it is how to express a logical statement using Gates using English and using logical expressions and work with those and work with those representations. So that's where we're going with this.  I'm such a couple definitions here. I know there's a lot of text on the slide, so I'm not going to I'm going to read it all at once but I'm not going to expect at this is seared into your memory the first time you see it. I just want to make sure that these four terms are things that were aware of. So we're going to use the word proposition to mean statements that could be true or false exactly 1 of true or false and we will have variables in these a propositional statement is it we will have variables in these propositional statement about any proposition and will want to talk to either true or false variables that could happen.  Find dates with Gainesville used operations like and an X or a Nordic combined things. I'm so we're going to use similar operations to combine them and then truth table we've seen his input output tables forget. What we're going to do is extend that to having true and false as in the table instead of just having ones and zeros in a table to think to make it to force us to think about this idea of true and false statements.  So we're going to start using some new notation to talk about to talk about some of these operations. And so the new notation is going to be showing up here.  And the new notation is going to let us write down these proposition in nice sort of either math texter in line in English, but they do correspond to skate that we've been talking about.  So we are going to see this correspondence between 0 and false in one in true and start writing to use an Epson these tables and a little carrot the symbol or the hay without a crossbar is in the definition for and that's the symbol used to combine two propositions with an and then the the thing that looks like a Crosshair. Is there a cross in a circle means exclusive or some symbols for these tables are the same as zeros replace with Epsom ones replacement.  So let's start talking about a few more of these operations and I'll open this one up for you to fill in so just in terms of some more vocabulary book and you'll hear I'm and we call a conjunction and there's another operation that we haven't really used yet, which is what we usually think of is or in a programming language. And what I want you to do here is just reading the table and thinking about English definition or versus exclusive or what's going to be the output for this Junction table. I'm reading from top to bottom. What are the what are going to be the true and false values for this table?  I just got this one first-round. I'm not going to do two rounds on this question.  five four  3  2  1  alright, so  even if useful the next exclusive or or xor is just the highlights of these are two different operations where we have this is going to produce true here. And then anytime there's a true in either spot will get a True Result. The only time we get fall is it both inputs or false bro wear false comes out for xor in truth comes out for right at using this little V and sort of The Upside Down version of the M symbol and that's going to be the way we we write it when we write an expression.  I'm either going to be sort of helpful building blocks and xor in or as we go forward.  I want to talk about one more. So how about this operation negation? How would you describe this operation in English this operation of negation in English. So we have these nice English descriptions of these are coming along the bottom. How do you describe this one in English?  Raising hand and just give an English description of this operation based on its table.  Swap interesting swap. So if if he can put the particular value swappa to the other one other English descriptions. Can you use that word in to find it a little bit later toggle not all of these are all of these getting nice and nice high-level English descriptions of what we might mean here and not as interesting. I think all of these are pretty interesting we could also just say if p is true then it produces false. If he is false that it produces true. That would be an English description.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great question. Yeah, so you're actually highlighting something about this picture down here right here is the logic circuit for triangle with a circle at the end. And it only interesting thing about negation operators that take two operands are two arguments negation only takes one that had multiple inputs because it sort of Define is this single unirii operation that doesn't work on multiple operation said here. I like the idea of saying it's not going to write down some of the words you said because  We want to make this English description happen. So I like some of the words that definition here.  The song about one more one more interesting example of connecting things logically and it's going to introduce one more kind of gate or kind of operator that we might want it. So I said the propositions are going to be used to represent statements that could be true or false and if use fully use these kinds of proposition reason about statements we might make about systems about Computing systems. The messages scan for viruses.  There's two propositions that we could see in that sentence one is that the messages scan for viruses? And the other is that the message was sent from an unknown system and I want you I'm going to do two rounds on this question. I want you to think about it alone first and then I want you to talk about it cuz there's actually some really interesting discussion to have about how we want to express this which one of these logical statements are these propositions below matches this we pick the s's this scanning for viruses and you isn't one unknown system. So which one of these is the idea of what's described in English there when we have Disconnected by this this idea that something happening whenever something else happens.  Do be do be do the silent first round want to silent first round for everyone's first opinion for this one.  Where is silent a silent first-round A Silent Forest Valley? Just want to open it for like another couple seconds and then you cook then you can discuss.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, I noticed that's not of God.  All right, click in again with the results of talking about this with the folks around you or reflecting on this a little bit.  5 4 3 2 1  okay.  All right, so I want to show the answer to that. So I wanted book before I did. I just want to be clear. This is going to be a case where we have to agree on what some language means by talking through some examples of an English sentence. I I can't really tell you that it's the right answer because of some incredible mathematical truth. This requires us to do some interpretation, which is why I'm using this example. So I just in terms of what folks in the class pot. So it was a popular answer both before and after discussion that it was and was it we did no one changes their mind.  People went away from be people went away from bee and maybe those people went towards and maybe yeah, okay and maybe towards the okay, but that but no one changed their mind away from a the people who are the people who or at least the same number of people, I guess people could have slept in and out of these categories of people who answer key. Do you want me to write something else other than the four options that are here. Do you want some other some other statement? Yeah.  So you are or s?  conjunction and S  you and us new Anda. So at that's interesting because we could ask about comparing the results of you and de tu es and you and one thing we looked at the look at the table for these we look at the table for an the order of the the two variables and does not matter cases in the same assignments of UNS.  I know you're looking for a few then s interesting. Is that similar to what you were going to say? Yeah, you really where's the one that says if you  then ask Joe you didn't teach us about this one yet. Where is that one in this list? Cuz I don't even think it's barely a majority picked as there are lots of folks who thought these other interpretations might make sense. So one thing one thing that's going to be important for any savings that are kind of used Benz or whenever is it Concrete in this example? What about if it wasn't sent from an unknown sender? "
