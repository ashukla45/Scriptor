    "Full Transcript": "Okay, let's get started. So there's a couple things I want to talk about talk about today and just to set the stage for this week and next week. Today. We're going to get practice with strong induction. So those the technique we saw at the end of class on Friday was this idea of doing induction where we get to use the inductive hypothesis for all the numbers up to the current number were proving instead of just for the last number so it will practice with that again. And when was it introduced a new proof technique as well, we're going to be working with over today and Wednesday and Thursday into Friday is talking about some properties of the sets of numbers. We've left these really implicit so far. We've talked to some kind of about what natural numbers are Kind of about using integers and managers before and prime numbers in particular. We did things like assume that there are infinitely many primes in one clicker question. And that's something that I want to talk about in detail today. This is the reason we're doing this is because it's going to set us up for talking about infant size sets much more precisely. So there's all these things that we use in Computing that are sometimes we talked about things like the set of DNA strands that are up to a particular length, but then if we want to talk about all the ideas relate to numbers relate to how many natural numbers are all relate to how many integers there are I'm in relate to the different kinds of numbers until we have to talk about some of these properties. In order to use silly talk about the sizes of sex and it turns out that it's really important people to talk about the size of set background. So one of the things we've been talking about all quarter and using all quarter this idea base expansion that it forces us to confront another representation of numbers. So we have the representation of numbers that we write, you know in Arabic numerals like we talked about doing things in binary in base 16 one more representation of numbers, but this is nice because it helps And one interesting question we could ask is how do we prove that we can actually represent every positive integer base 2 expansion 3 expansion, right? Every positive integer actually has one of these expansions that we can find for it. I think we all kind of believe that cuz we figured out how to do it for just about every number we've try but it's interesting to think about what a proof of that property would look like because that would tell us that really these Basics mansions that some of them existed Fitbit know we can really talk about these things being the same the same set as the set of these positive numbers. So we had these two ways of calculating a base expansion given a number one involved repeatedly dividing the number and the other involved doing a log at the start to figure out how many I'm working through those digits individually thinking a little bit about which one of these we talked a little bit of a on Friday about how sometimes our proof can imply or be related to specific implementation. It's worth thinking about which one of these is going to be more related to a proof and we're going to use strong induction in this case approved by strong induction that we can always find an expansion. It's really interesting to see which one of these stations going to look more like that which one of these implementations the one where we repeatedly divide or the one where we go to calculate the number of bits first using bog and then fill them in Do you think he's going to be more amenable to it like a strong induction proof or more related to a strong induction proof, which of these is going to be more useful to think about if the structure of a strong induction proof? Okay any thoughts on this which one of these is going to be more amenable to a strong induction proof is our strong induction proof going to be more like the first one or more like the second one.  you think  Someone from the back half of the center of the center section.  More like the first one or more like the second one until I get to one person.  Sauce on the side closer to me in the back half of the center section.  If you just have the same base 1 or base 2.  music Meister  By the second one.  the second one  Yeah.  How many units do you have? How many digits you have interesting? So you're saying in the first one? It's sort of doesn't if it doesn't have this global view where you figure out all these the number of digits and have to work within that you're always sort of just going to jump in and start dividing.  I agree. By the way, I think these to the 2nd of limitation is going to be more like a strong induction proof. Any other reasons. Yeah.  Interesting. So you're saying it might be the case here starts at 0 and it might be easier to start from those smaller code from right to left trysting to that's interesting to think about as well. The only thing I point out is that one thing that's going on here is that in the value of an which is stored in queue. So and is immediately starting Q at the beginning of this procedure and then we keep dividing it by some numbers by be in the case of base 2 expansions. It'll be divided by 2. Means. It's definitely a specific way. And so strong induction will let us talk about that smaller number that were using that were using to talk about that.  And so will be able to say something about this / base Dior / 2 number and use that in the proof doing this by strong induction. So our goal is to so I'm looking at the the first errand that you have the every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of 2. So, what do you think the base case looks like for this the base case look like for this?  the basis step  basis stop  heck is the bassist up here.  What are we trying to show? What are we trying to show in the basis step of this proof will be more fun if it's Interactive.  Okay. What are we what what do we need to demonstrate here in the face. What do I need to demonstrate?  When is the distinct power of 2 is a way of saying it one is a distinct power of two. What else is other way is a good way to describe it.  He said one is a distinct.  power of to refine this a little bit and say one is  sum of distinct powers of 2  because really what we're trying to show we're going to try and show this in general for all numbers and the distinct power of to hear. What's the life we would slip power of two. What are we going to pick as the the coefficient? We're kind of looking for we're looking for an a 0 in base 2 that's equal to one. That's what we're looking for.  Right there exists some a 0 right so that we can say that that's what we're trying to demonstrate here. Right? What's the coefficient? We're in base 2 in one of them to represent one. It's just going to work out in this case that we only need one and only pick a 0 equal 0 this wholesome ends up being two to the zero and that's equal to 1.  The right I do not right.  I do not write.  No, I'm trying to sneak something by you here to make sure that you're paying attention and all the pieces, right?  What I do wrong.  Israel should be equal the one yeah, so  really the expansion here is the coefficients * 100 * going to be the coefficients in the binary representation the different powers of 2 pencil. This is 1 * 2 to the zero and that's equal to one right in the binary representation or the base to representation. We can represent one and it's the one we want to show exactly that there's some sequence of these coefficients. They're going to B100 it's cuz we're in base 2 that makes that makes a binary representation for a particular number and this would demonstrate the base case would be able to say here is a zero for the bass.  So let's talk about the the recursive step now. I have a few options which of these which of these options makes sense for this recursive. So sorry, I'm just going to pick us up.  Which of these options make sense of the recursive step?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick and again, where can I go?  5  4321 okay, so so so that's interesting. So some people I just want to compare the answers before I'll show you the answers before and after choosing and where did where did they move they moved A's and B's or both more move to a cease. It looks like both of these work. Folks think that be a good idea here and implementation is showing up in be so there's a lot of Correspondence there and we can we can say why why be is in fact a good idea and works here in a minute. Hey works or not. So whether it's both of these or if it's just be and sew in a what we're saying is Well, we can definitely right and is this some  Can come up with some binary representation for an by the inductive hypothesis and all we need to do is we know we can always add to 2002 it add add one to that number and we just be adding on one more power of two there and that produces nplusone. So we're done. Where's the problem with that argument really important one really important word in the definition of the property and in the justification in a that makes this not be true.  Yeah this word distinct.  Says, well, you don't get to just add up to to the zero over and over and over again in the by base 2 binary expansion. What you have is one coefficient for the power 0 and 100 efficient to the power 1 + 1 ^ to be distinct powers of 2 1in each one in each position until a doesn't work because if we if we ran through and sort of talked about either building an implementation out of a demonstration 0 + 2 + 0 + 220 + 220 equals 4, which is not what this property is trying to say this property trying to talk about distinct hours up to so it does not work. That would not be a good argument here because of the word distinct what shows up within the property and in justification here, right? This justification is just inconsistent because there's nothing that says the powers of include  220 already include that power and so the Sobe actually works here and I want to just talk about sort of y1 insight for you works.  So the idea for YB work is  that  a different IP Works. Let's just imagine a particular number. Let's imagine.  Talking about making sure that there's a base 2 expansion for 6. So let's choose six is the thing. We're trying to prove and we can run that inductive hypothesis step for for sex and that says the first thing the inductive hypothesis step says is take  6  Dev 2 and assume  there is a  Ace of Base 2  expansion 3 we know that exists, right? We know that exist in this in the structure of the proof. We're going to have to demonstrate that later cuz it's an assumption. So we'll talk about that in a minute, but we know that one one phase 2 represents.  3 which is 60 of 2. We know that and we can talk about how we justify that in a second.  And the way we use that information to build a representation for 6 is we say we're going to shift this down.  By 1 and then we're going to buy one spot. So these are all still distinct powers of 2 or just using higher exponent for each one of them moving them over by one position mean increasing all of their exponents by 1 and then we're going to fill in this box with either a 0 or a 1 in this case Zero.  Because I 6.  mod  2 is equal to 0 interesting results care. Now if we wanted to show that 3 works, right? This is actually what if we wanted to push this proof all the way all the way through for a particular number. We then talk about 3/2 having some representation 302  has the representation which is just one base to we can shift that over to be one in an empty box space to Ennis gets filled in with a one because three  this is 3 mod.  And eventually we're going to bottom out at 1 because here we would end up bottoming out this entire chain of justification at 1 and so this is an interesting recursive structure because every time we talked about justifying the next level down dividing by 2 and finding the justification for that number, we going to bottom out at 1 and give us a smaller number every time we can always get this entire justification of using base to the function based to sort of why that function always work and produces different powers.  Any questions about this idea of this proof before going on?  list two more  proofs. I want to do one little it's actually in detail in the book. So I'm just going to talk about it talk about the big ideas. And then there's another proof with another proof techniques and I want to talk about so we've talked about basic pension does a way to represent positive integers. There's another way we can represent positive integers and that's by representing them as a product of a bunch of prime numbers. So there's this theorem that's an interesting theory on that every positive integer greater than one can be written down as a product of prime number so multiplication in a prime number greater than 1 Prime and so it's kind of interesting to see how this works and why  How it all ends up giving us this idea a collection of primes is another way to represent a number it's going to factor into those primes multiplied together to talk about that number so we can have the decimal representations and base expansions representation and its prime factorization is another way to uniquely talk about that number kind of an interesting property of how positive integers for the first thing I want to ask is which of these options here are factorizations by which I are prime factorization by which I mean they show how the number is represented as a product of prime numbers. So which one of these are factorizations  5 4 3 2 1  Going to point out a few things here. Actually, all the answers answers are interesting lots of others for 10 or 20 seconds might clear up one or two confusion between you let us talk about it for 20 seconds.  Okay Quicken again cooking again.  Hey 5 4 3 2 1.  There's a couple things I want to point out bee does not fit this definition because one is not Prime.  And part of that is because the definition of primes just says that the numbers have to be greater than one common definition of crimes that rules out one entirely because it's not very interesting to talk about the factors of 1 and starting from 2 and up makes it so that we're talking about numbers that clearly when we have a prime number. There's really two different factors that are just one in that number with one of these cases are hard to understand and it's not very interesting number for anything we want to do with prime. So it would also make this not unique cuz we can keep multiplying by 1 over and over and over again and keep expanding the factorization with more factors of 1 so we will not affect the prime factorization of 100.  We took out the one that would be in a see this doesn't work because again for is not Prime.  So we're trying to write these out as products of completely prime numbers only prime numbers. And so we would have to break this up into two and two to talk about the factorization of 20.  This is a trick question and I didn't warn you usually like to warn you when I ask you a questions. But A&D or both reasonable answers here both match the definition of factorization of 9 factor with three and three which or both Prime. So that's a prime factorization. And in order to talk about the fact that prime numbers prime factorization. We have to allow I'm can just be one prime long. So threes factorization is just three that's the only fact the only prime factor of 3 and so we just have to allow for the Countess factorization so that we can say all of the positive integers 2 and above have the factorization.  and I didn't give you a spot to give a protest vote here, but both of these work and a lot of folks Josie and the the proof of this is  I want to see I want to see you here. I'm just going to lay a little bit of this is in the book, but it's about the basis step in detail.  basically argue  that to  oops back door back doors  itself much like the three case on the last line.  And a recursive step is pretty interesting.  Because we get to assume by the recursive step all the numbers that are smaller than the number we're looking at our prime or Si have a prime factorization. So that assumption ends up being really useful because we can start to talk about decomposing the number we're looking at the two cases that are listed on your sheet want to think about what happens in these two cases just a preview for If you want to review this directly in the book case one is that  so just to be clear all  positive  incense  and less than or equal to n  have  a factorization  and we want to show that n + 1 does.  And so either end plus one.  Is prime.  or  And plus one equals some multiplication of two factors. That aren't n + 1 + 1 if it's a composite number that ends plus one has to be equal to something. That's like let's just say k  x m  where can I buy a is greater than 1 and M is greater than 1 mm must have ran into these other two numbers because it's not fine because the definition of prime says the only factors would be in plus one and one but this must mean that there's some other factors if it's not Prime.  Then we can do it. We can use inductive hypothesis on K&M because not only do we know that K&M are greater than one. We also know that K&M must be less than 10 plus one because we multiply them together to get in plus one. So K is less than and + 1 + m is less than and plus one.  That tells us we can use the inductive hypothesis on K&M. So K&M must have some prime factorization and then we can talk about the primes that make up K and the primes that make up M. Am I playing those together to get the to get a prime factorization 4 in plus one result of nowhere already done because the only Factor there isn't plus one and you can see how details and any necessary sort of algebra is filled in by looking looking this up in the book the page number. I believe that a page number is on is on your hand out. There's another property that's interesting to talk about.  So there's this another again for this is all on the back of the sheet in space were talking about this is on the back of the hand out when so there's this idea that there's infinitely many prime. Like there's just an infinite number of primes no matter how many you lives. Do you always feel this more Prime stop at some prime number and there's no more prime numbers. This is a difficult statement to prove on its own in this class. So if you saw the try and prove something else that means the same thing to us. So the first the first thing I want to talk about is with property we should actually try to prove  In order to get this idea that there are infinitely many primes which one of these accurately expresses that.  5 4 3 2 1  the most of the class agrees and I just want to say one or two things about this study is the Adidas one way to talk about this property in a way that will be a little more straightforward for us to do a proof.  And the other one so there is a smallest prime number is true, but not useful and not equivalent to this right? There's definitely there's no prime number smaller than 2 but it's not the same property is this that's not very useful. There is no smallest prime number is not true and not equivalent to this. There is a greatest prime numbers an interest in property, but that would tell us if we knew there was a greatest prime number that would tell us actually there's finitely many primes if we knew there was some number that was Prime and there were no other primes larger than it we can just look at all the numbers that are smaller than that number and that must be in some number of those will be Prime and that's it. That's all the Primes there are so interesting property. It happens to not be true but its negation is exactly expressing his idea that has infinitely many Primes.  Under the new Pro strategy were going to use to talk about this interesting way and there's a specific it helps us structure how we talk about these proofs. What I want you to do is just read the statement of proof by contradiction. It's at the bottom of the back side of the screen by contradiction and a little bit of the start here and I want you to come up with questions that you have observations that you have about this definition and how it starts talk about how to push this professor.  Okay, what question questions or observations about this definition in a proof by contradiction? What's weird? What's interesting questions about observations about it?  The right hand side is always going to evaluate the false interesting questions about or observe their interesting about this definition of proof by contradiction. Yeah.  Interesting. So you're saying if if it's true that the the conclusion of this implication is a contradiction then maybe that causes some problems for showing that overall statement so we can go back to that two questions and thoughts from other questions or observations about this strategy definition of proof by contradiction or questions about the proof we started  Yeah. Yeah. So your question is like in this context. It's pretty clear that P&R should be propositions or predicate or Blake predicate Expressions the proposition that are related to being Prime because that's what we're working on. Right but in general like how do we pick a good are because there's nothing in those nothing that says we're trying to prove something about are in the beginning. So we had to invent this our right of this is that  This part and I'm being careful to only Circle the conclusion.  This is definitely a contradiction is going to evaluate.  So first first question, right that is a contradiction that always evaluates the fall second question was doesn't that mean we're going to have trouble demonstrating this entire implication is well that actually tells us something about not pee which is that we are going to have to say something about that left hand side of a hypothesis being in order for this whole thing to be true which is going to be interesting is demonstrate this weird. Well if we don't know much about  The relationship between P&R when we start out know you're asking. How do we pick an AR right? One of the ideas here is we're going to pick an r that we think is that we already know is true. Somehow like it almost obvious that it's true like some proof that we've already already done. Right? So this are that we're choosing in this proof is something that we just talked about being true and really the interesting thing here. Is it true. Anyway, we are is going to be true regardless of what the value of P or not pee is the interesting thing here is we're going to show that not P implies not our regardless of get to demonstrate his right hand side. They were aiming for the goal here is to show that not his fault that actually would would work in many of the cases where we want to prove by contradiction.  Using these are helped us structure the proof by saying there's this thing we know is true and if we can show that it's false so clearly because if we dated it would be able to demonstrate his nonsense clean. And so the choice of our it's interesting the way the book rights this because I've seen this written in other ways would like not be implied fall things like that. But I like the way the book rights it because he guides us towards picking some property that we know something about so in this case or picking his other property, it's something we just proved and we're going to show ID if he isn't true that if not p is true. Then that thing that we know is true has to be false.  Structure of picking some other properties in demonstrating its fall and it's some other property that we know is true is what we're going to do when we set up proof by contradiction.  So here we are making this assumption that there is some largest prime number because remember the property that we were trying to prove is that there is no greatest prime number that the property were trying to prove its negation. Is that there exists a largest prime number? So that's P that's not pee this part here.  corresponds to the assuming the not be here and we chose our  to be this thing that we just proved that some other property that's talking about.  All natural numbers all positive integers greater than one here. It's going to be true. No matter what. So what we're trying to show is at this property are is false.  cool  We want to show that there's some positive integer that's greater than 1 that is not a product of primes.  I want to show that there's some positive integer greater than 1 that is not a product of primes cuz that's what we get. When we wanted when we in the gate are some positive integer greater than 1 is not a product of primes that we can try that then we'll be happy.  I'll be happy you'll maybe be feel however you want to feel but I'll be happy.  I'm just going to rewrite this to show here that we just talked about.  which is  some number  greater than one  that is not  a product  Apprentice  that's the sort of counterexample version or the negated version of the statement of our is that there exists a number greater than one and it's not a product of primes and made the Assumption. So the Top Line says assume that there's a largest prime number PN since we made that assumption I missed calls back to something I said when we were looking at the clicker question or talked about this entire sequence of all the prime numbers.  Because if TN is the largest prime number all of the primes must be smaller than that number so we can talk about p.m.  And if this is an interesting idea that we can just list these out and I want to highlight that.  We can do this for this arbitrary but fixed.  PN that we've assumed  The largest prime number we know must exist because of this exact statement. And since we have this arbitrary but sticks number that were talking about that we know exists we can say well there is this sequence starts at 1 and goes up to this number if we wanted to go into tons of detail, we could try and not have any... It's here by describing that thing with some kind of set builder notation or some kind of recursive definition. But since this is some fixed number is definitely some fixed integer. It's totally reasonable to write this out with these... And then we're trying to look for the counterexample this number that is greater than one that's not a product of primes and I hear is the idea here that we're going to choose this number Q, which is  Multiplication of all of the prime numbers plus 1 and just to put the parentheses here so that it's really clear what this number is multiplied together. We had one to that number.  And now this is now this is like a counterexample proof. We're trying to actually witness proof. We're trying to show that this is not a product of prime. This number Q could not possibly be a product of prime. This is like an existing and we're trying to show that this number can't be a product of primes.  Let's just go down here. And I think this statement is here is that we written lemon and the intermediate property we need is that none of these P eyes, none of these individual Prime could possibly be a factor of Q?  But that statement for a minute. None of these could possibly be a factor of Q.  I want to just do a little bit of explanation of why that's the case. Let's just think about P1 for a second because it involves at least algebraic manipulation here. So let's think about T1. We can write Q.  as P1  X T2... PN  plus one  and that's really interesting because our definition of factoring says that if the P1 would be a factor of Q if we could write you as a q is  P1 X some k + 0 there's no remainder when we talked about writing this as a factors as integer X if you want what it would mean.  That's what I mean for it to be a factor. "
