    "Full Transcript": "Let's get started. So I waited for an extra minute or so just cuz it's the first. I'll start right at 9. So I'll be introducing myself in a second. I want to talk about the news about the street math. It's about the math some of the math that we use in computer science. But I want to highlight two specific things that I want you to get out of this course, we want you to get out of this course in all the fine that we in a minute. So these days you are all seeing lots of systems programs algorithms from Google translate driving directions to cars that drive themselves and most of us these things are pretty impressive and we trust them a lot. And so when we get answers from systems as computer scientist, it's useful to exercise some healthy Technic. Skepticism about if those answers represent good answers to the problem. We're asking questions. We should ask to prove at if one major theme of this part is going to be skeptical of the answers were getting and the argument that are leading us to those answers. So technical skepticism is going to be a big fan of the course something we want you to get out of it.  Another thing that I want you to get out of it is ideas about communicating technical content you have done you are going to do or have done some example programming getting automated system to give answers to problems.  It's useful to be able to think about that program not just in terms of it working one time to be able to talk about what you intended to happen and communicating technical results say to customers to researchers to other students to your boss all of those audiences require a different and picking a different representation of the problem to talk about other Wes Moore related to impacting people's lives are more related to the technical details of getting something to work in the talking about a problem and work on technical communication. Those are two big themes. We're going to have to be really successful for you.  So no one of the things that's going to happen a lot in this lecture. If you are going to not just hear from me, but you're going to talk to one another or we're going to be plenty of time for you to discuss. So I want to take a minute for you to introduce yourselves to want to take a minute to introduce yourself to the person next to an hour, maybe two or three of the people around you.  Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for taking the heart. I'm glad you just met today as we talked through some problems. The next thing I want to do is introduce the the team of it. So the reason I've been saying we to call instructor so there's myself. My name is Jo pulley politz. That's how you pronounce my last name.  I'm so where there's two sections of this Forest is this one that I'm teaching now? And another one with Alexa is right now and I are running them as one combined Force the same course staff all the same assignments. I'm just too different lecture section so you can contact us by email with anything that's private sensitive needs to be handled in general. The best way to contact us is going to be through the Piazza board for the class. You can always post privately on Piazza to the instructors or just to the staff with any private question. I'm in for any content questions. It's good to ask either privately or publicly on Piazza depending on when it's a question about homework, which is it includes.  Can I have introduced yourself? So your name? And then just what year in a few here and Marco? Carmosino? I'm a TA. I'm a PhD student here and I'm actually finishing up this quarter. I did my  I did my PhD in theoretical computer science because an uncomfortable number of years ago. Now I took this class and it was this class at UMass and it was so exciting that I got trapped in a PhD in this material. So hopefully love enjoy the class some amount as much as I did.  Hello everyone. I'm Carlos. I'm a third-year undergraduate student.  Tell everyone I'm Maria. I'm a second-year undergrad student and I really love to you as well. Enjoy it as much as I could.  Hi everyone. My name is Herman. I'm a third-year computer science student and I love this great might I hope you all will enjoy this class as well.  Thank you. Awesome the staff as a lot in this purse still be holding office hours to get help them along with professor and Amy Fletcher a section A few of them will be here. And when we have discussion where you're talking to the people around you on Bill also be available to answer questions in class. So grateful to the tremendous staff that we have introduced some of the logistics of what deadlines are going to look like in the course what homeworks going to look like in the course those kinds of things and then I want to dive into some content. We're going to talk about some material and notation to get started today. So the main thing the main thing  Can you tell about the course or what is the work look like? So in general you're going to be doing a little bit of preparation for lecture in lecture will have a pretty interactive lecture. Will I be asking questions and you'll be discussing different kinds of homework. There's going to be in a minute that I'm going to keep using our warm-up assignments homework assignments and follow up assignments three different kinds of assignment that will be doing that sort of have different flavors. Are there of the textbook for the course we listen official addition that we are going to forgive page numbers and things you can use any additional going to be talking about are provided across the different Edition. So if you find a different Edition, that's fine. We have an evening midterm. So get that on your calendar that Wednesday May 1st in the evening is going to be the one Midtown.  For the classes one exam during it for there is a website. It's also printed at the top of the worksheet that you got today that has all the detailed information about how the classes graded in details of the syllabus and has links to just about everything everything that you need for the course that's a place where you can get the schedule for the course resources like the PDF and then typical set of things that we have for submitting work and getting help we're going to be using a service called gradescope where you'll get an invite for that that we send out Piazza for discussion and then we have office hours and also the classes podcast so you can always access to lectures with audio and video after the lecture.  One thing we're going to do in this course, you see this little window in the upper right of my screen with the green arrow. It says multiple choice will be doing in class and we sent an email about this but this is the first time you're seeing. This is we're going to be using Liquors in this class and so cold after clicker if you have a clicker so it's like I mean, you don't have to have one on day one to be clear. Like you're not missing any credit by not having one on day one or anything like that. I just want to see how many answers I'm about to get for this question. So I actually so I'm going to check right now to make sure that I have the frequency set, right this room says that the frequencies be able to make sure that I'm I'm actually set correctly. I just realized that I made this class this morning and I don't want you to all of a sudden try to click in. There we go now ranvier start this up answer the question.  Answer with your clicker is the question in the bottom left here, which is why would we use iclickers in class? Why would we do it we do it  and just make sure that you're seeing like a checkmark on your screen or some sort of feedback that you're thicker worked. It's a good time to double-check.  I want to reassure you the clicker policy for the chorus is such that if you're like missing something or something is misconfigured for a day or two. You're not going to lose lose a bunch of credit. I just want to give people a chance to try this out. Okay cool, and I'll show you the results for this question 20 people said the force 100% attendance and I'll lectures 16 said to make sure you're awake cool and see if he is actually why and beer would be sort of shallow reasons to do it. But see is actually a pretty good reason to do it. There's numerous studies in different stem classes. This work actually started out of people who teach physics but has now spread to lots of stem stem Majors showing pretty compelling evidence that students learn more if they do certain styles of answering questions and discussing with their peers in class. So we do it because they're sort of the preponderance of evidence that it helps you learn and that's a good reason to do something.  Real talk about this other question that I have up or are you taking or do you plan to take math? 109 don't know why I would ask that why that would be on the slide?  Yeah, where you going to say? Yeah, yeah math 109 and CSC 20 satisfy you the place in your schedule that you don't need to use. I'm so just be aware the CSC 20 in math 109 are going to act as prerequisites in the same way. Me and my saying that right.  So if you have a map if you have a math dependency, you might need math 109 if you're taking CST classes, either one of these could satisfy, so don't you don't need to double up there. Thanks, man.  So so I want to talk a little bit about these three kinds of assignments I mentioned so I mentioned that they were going to be warm ups follow-ups and homework and different kinds of assignments what the schedule is going to look like in the course for the first few weeks, and I'm I want to use that talk about how this is going to work. So we're going to talk about a couple different things that we talked about in this first topic you'll see that later on and we to do on Thursday. I says warm up one and that one is for responding to stop at once and next week on Thursday. You're going to signment do called warm up one that's about content from this week. Content from this week after warm up one then you'll have a homework says homework 1  Another assignment call and follow-up one another assignment called follow up on three separate assignments that have to do with content from this week is the warm-up the homework and the follow and then 4 topic 2. There will be a warm-up homework and a follow-up never topics to talk about the intro in a second. But the idea is that these warm ups are really for you to get your first practice with the topics that we taught the previous week. These are open to collaborating with anyone in the class. You can ask lots of public questions on Piazza about them. You don't you don't have to really worry about getting information from you either a TA or for someone in the class that you weren't allowed to get when you're doing the warm-up assignment is to get first practice with that content.  Then after you hand in the warm-up, which is due on Thursdays will have a recall homework and homework you can do you can do alone or you can do you can't work outside the pair or the partner that you're that you're working with your choice in who you work with the homework. You have to work alone or with a partner on this.  Then there's a follow-up assignment where you work alone. You can't work in pairs. You have to work alone on this assignment questions privately and then these are the ones they're going to do the following Thursday. What's the warm-up gives you a chance to have lots of conversation in collaboration about the content figure out notation figure out vocabulary homework is a place where you can do some deep work. You can pick how you like to work with you would like to work alone or with a partner and really get into the content of this will be written homework reflects a lot of thinking that you do then the follow-up gives us a place to independently assess what you learned. Basically it's for you and I to check in that you understood what happened with that topic and you can think of the follow-ups is a nice individual test for yourself, especially when you think about preparing yourself for an exam. These three stages are going to happen for all the topics in the Corso for each week. There'll be this warm up.  Homework follow-up plan as the three things that we do for homework. The only exception to this is the first week because we don't have any topic 0 so we have an introductory assignment and then we'll have a follow-up to it that in the independent follow up to it. Let's do next Thursday for the first weeks a little bit of an exception. Yeah.  So generally like the day after the last thing so warm up one will be posted on on Thursday. And then on Friday Friday morning homework, when will be posted next day though release it earlier for that sort of the latest it'll get released and I'll give you the in for the warm-up will be able to release all the answers and things like that for the warm-ups and we had that information to go forward. Did you want to have anything about any other questions about this sort of schedule?  When are they due on Thursday? So they always be these are due date so you can think of each of the things in blue as being a current Topic in a follow-up for the previous topic.  So some so you will it it depends a little bit on the week. If all the homework problems will be out while to warm up without or not, but it should be a reasonable amount of work for the time that's listed for the spam. It won't be like if it's before only if we give it if it's only for 4 days 7 days of work to do in 4 days.  the questions about this format  All right, so I wanted to do one more thing to see you one more thing quick. Actually wow, almost just  Okay, maybe I don't even need to say this.  Set alarm devices in class for a second, which is I was looking at what was on people's laptop screens that are open and you are looking at what's up on your laptop screen all the time, right?  If you are sitting in with your laptop open, there's just like a whole cone of people behind you who because of the way human physiology work can't help but look at your screen.  Repeat they literally can't help it there. I is going to go down there some number of times per minute. No matter how much they try and focus on this screen. That's a terrible thing. If your laptop screen or your tablet screen or whatever you have up CSE Twain notes that you're taking or CST 20 content on it. They're going to be like, oh, yeah cool right there going to be getting like to extremes worth of information about cst20. I may be a little distracting to their eye but not the end of the world and not taking them completely out of The Learning Experience there. They're having so the Rollie like to have in my lectures is if you have a screen open, it had a CFC 20 content on it. It's the slides for the day the notes for Dad something that's related to CSE twenties lecture content for the day. If you want to have a screen open that does not have cst20 content on it. I understand.  Please sit in the back two rows because that limits the number of people whose attention is stolen by the screen you have up. So if you want to have some email that's not related to see if he 20 or whatever open on your screen and you want to be that you want to be trying to do that multitasking. Please sit in the back two rows. I don't I understand that some people believe they can multitask personally. Sometimes I'm in a talk and think I'm multitasking and really I'm getting nothing done. I want to have my email open. If you want to do that. Just keep in mind that you are part of a big room that you're responsible for not stealing the attention of other people device policy for the course. I walked around website. So so that's basically all I want to say for the day.  Mustang have a lot of detail in the website so you can look there for questions about specific reading questions and specific policy questions for the day.  Logistics questions  Let's get started.  The worksheet you have one side of it has a bunch of notation examples and the other side has a specific example. We're going to be working through today station examples are useful because they're going to be a bunch of pieces of notation. We use in the first 3 weeks and discovers a bunch of them. The particular application is this Netflix example, so it's the example with the table that says fire and Moana and decide I want us to be looking at right now.  And I want to talk about Netflix for a minute. So I'm in Netflix and in tons of systems where you either what content to read content of any system that has a bunch of content in a bunch of users and tries to recommend things to users. There's an interesting question of what information is used to recommend new content to existing users. Sometimes they show up at the top of my foot Netflix speed and sometimes they don't know how does Netflix make the decision but what things should appear high in my recommendations on what things should  And there's a couple of answers for this. We're going to explore one answer today. So what precisely which is Netflix can look at my viewing history or somehow figure out what movie is don't like maybe I explicitly voted on some of them or maybe it just knows that I stopped in the middle of watching something and so I probably didn't like that but somehow Netflix knows something about the movies. I like and don't like Netflix has this information for all of the users that use Netflix Netflix and Netflix can ask questions. Like how similar are my preferences to someone else's preferences and other movies that they have watch that I haven't.  It might be good to recommend to me if we have very similar preferences very different preferences and they like maybe that's not a good movie to calculating something about or defining something about the similarity of preferences between users can be one way to start making recommendations the matches what we do socially right kind of movies that my friends watch. So I'm going to take their recommendations for new movies right way to build recommendation system is to talk about similarities and preferences.  What we have on the worksheet is this table where we listed for people who rp144 neither users of Netflix and for each of three movies Netflix has some information about their preferences. We're here and X means I didn't like it. Means that they didn't have no preference and a check means that they liked it.  No, we want to take these things and represent them.  You want to take these things and represent them mathematically somehow because one of the things we're going to do is try and work with these things actually do calculations not just texting exes. And so is a definition of each of these rows as a 3-2. So it's 3 to order collection of three different numbers. It happens. All these numbers are -1 zeros in 1  For all of these examples of map the X to a negative one. The. Two is zero in the check to a one in each row and that gives us these three two poles for each of these first three rows. I'm so just take a minute at a couple seconds. And what should be the only goes in the Bottom Road just make sure we all agree on what free to take a second write that down just confirm with your neighbor for a second just make sure we agree on the notation here.  So this bottom one is going to be you can shout it out if you want. What's the first value?  Thanks I can value.  Third value. All right, so we can turn checks nx's it's a number straight.  So now that we have this information about but we can both think of it as he's mathematical objects and we can think about it a question for you which one of the first three people of P1 P2 P3 has movie preferences most similar to P for which one of these people do you think has the most similar preferences to P4?  5 4 3 2 1  Okay, cool, so we got some clothes for this I'm not going to show them just yet I want to go on and talk a little bit more about some of these some of these pieces so on the sheet after this question on the sheets there's a couple of different definitions of ways that we might talk about talk about defining this preference I'm curious for the answer you gave how did you decide things were related to one another how did you decide that the person who voted for head preference is similar to people it was your decision?  So you said the least far away look at all the values in the columns and said something about least far away from P4 other ways to die.  So you did some counting. So you said you you would put numbers to this idea of distance. You said the difference between each of the values of going to be subtracted somehow or out of the Muppets and calculations other ideas for talking about how you know, this preference. Yeah.  So you're giving another person more precise description of this idea of distance, which is you're saying like an X in it. Are closer than an X and a check, right? And so that's a nice English description maybe of this idea that you can count -2 instead of minus 1 is written English description about idea.  Yeah.  You look you use that. You were sort of telling us how many times they exactly agreed. Right? So for every time they either both had an ax both had a check and see exactly Dreamin talk about this comparison. None of these suggestions are right or wrong. Obviously, they might match some of our intuitions in some cases. They might be you give us surprising results in other cases and we can try and turn all of these ideas into either a mathematical expression to computer it or a program that calculates what I want to do to work with these definitions a little bit is talk about two of these definitions that we could use for talking about how close to people preferences are we're going to work through to definition and see the definitions of some interesting different properties in  So let's talk about calculating this first notion of distance that we have this ability to function definition of a function named D1.  D1 takes in a tuple of X1 up to XM and the two full of white wine up the y n and it calculates maximum of the absolute value of the differences of all of those of all those numbers taking them index by index.  So this is found something like counting differences, but then there's this maximum applied, right? So there's something going on there about the index by index or element by element differences looking at the columns and then there's a couple other definitions just to make sure that we've been precise here which is why we say let N be a positive integer, which means that we're going to have both of these two poles of the same length are example. Everything is a 3 Tuple right now, cuz there's three movies for each person and working streaming the problem just say that all of the x's and y's are like the x's and y's we saw an example they come from this at negative 1 0 1  This is the kind of definition of a kind of definition will be writing in this course. I just want all the words that are given. I'm in English definition on the on the back of your worksheet. So we get used to saying you these things out loud in class.  What talk about calculating this on this D1 function for P4 and the two people for P1 actually want to give you just a minute to think about this and talk about calculating this out to see what you'll get for an answer when the p12 Paul and we can come around and answer any questions you have so far.  See if people are people.  All right, so I want to do this one do this one on the board for you just to make sure that we sort of are being used on the P4 to fall was.  Looking at this sheet. We said P4 was going to be 0 negative 1 + 1 + P one is going to be negative 1 0 and 1 so that means we have x 1 is 0 x 2 is -1 x 3 is 1 y 1 negative 1 Y 2 is 0 y 3 is one we want to talk about all of those all the differences between so we're going to have 0 - -1 absolute value.  -1 - 0 absolute value + 1 - 1 - 1 absolute value  Those are the three results of subtracting the pairwise elements. So we end up with a 1 + -1.  And a zero and take the max of those three things.  And not equal to one.  4 degree with the how I got to that answer from these pieces they make any mistakes.  rp124 swapped  C1 and C4 swap soapy 1 MP4 swaps a little bit more about what you mean.  What's cuso4 P1 when I look at the P one row? I see an Icee -1 for the first thing in the tubule for X1 and that is the second argument. So I think that I have this set up according to the problem. It's good to check soapy one has an X Under Fire that corresponds to the negative one of the beginning of P1 the second argument to D1 so they should be through by 3. So I think I think I haven't matched up.  Interesting interesting does order matter. So there's going to be lots of lots of questions like that. That's right, like swapping something a reordering something. Let me give this answer to order function arguments appear in matters. Now, maybe the case that's something special about D1 makes it so we get same answers for different argument orders and that would be special about the one but definitely the argument order matters for functions and definitely the stupid order matters for matching the problem we're talking about where each of these numbers represents a specific specific movie has order definitely matters, and then we could talk about how special D1 is or how special this problem is that order a we can get the same answers for different orders.  This produces a 100 for D1 we get a one we get two of these elements that are 1 part 1 of one element that is exactly the same like at the 1120 lemax those and we get one. So this calculation of distance is giving us the biggest disagreement between these two people calculating is the largest disagreement that they had by this measure of subtracting subtracting the numbers tomorrow weather.  So with that in mind, I want you to apply this to get the answers for P4 mp2 and MP4 MP3. So when you're ready the answers that are from the answers that are here.  Play the song. Feel free to feel free to be discussing as you're doing this right now. Sometimes I'll ask you to answer on your own before discussing. But for this one, I just want you to feel disgusting and working to this together.  Hey, I'm going to close the clicker question in about 10 seconds.  3 2 1  So given the understanding that we have at this is calculating the maximum disagreements and also just sort of doing out the calculation and doing out the max calculation. We can see in kind of confirm that the answer is here that both of these end up being at 2. If we wanted to explain this in terms of this Max disagree we were talking about we can see that in the Moana call him there is definitely a disagreement between T4 and both P2 and P3 how to check are we can see the two there and since we're Mac since we're doing a maximum speed at the sort of hangs together that. Big disagreement contributes there.  So this is kind of interesting on a does it does support the argument that you all made. So the overwhelmingly you all is more similar to P4 than P2 or P3 overwhelmingly. So if this is a measure of distance MP3 or further than P1 nice if it makes sense that the distance from P2 and P3 is the same way for both of the second answers. We got a tattoo.  I don't know looking at this. I don't know if I agree or not. It's not clear for me immediately. If he for should be closer to one of P2 and P3.  Is there one of those at4 seems like it's closer to which one which one?  P3 yp3 yp3  So you're saying look if we go back to just this original tableview right on there's a big disagreement between P4 in P2 on bird box, right? And that disagreement doesn't exist between D4 and D3 in the box, So let's talk about another way that we can talk measure this another way that we could talk about his relationship to P2 and P3.  Enough of this interesting calculation. We were in here to finding another function called D2D to also takes into the same in terms of how we call it takes to two poles of length. And then what it does is it summing up the difference of the squares of the elements and then taking a square root of the end summing up the difference of the squares of the elements and taking a square root at the end.  So take a minute and I'll try and calculate there soon and I'll do it together. Just after giving you a couple seconds to get started on it. I really want you when I prompt you to get started on something. I really want you to start writing start thinking about what you write down. Sometimes I will go through it all on the board. Sometimes I want but you were starting to write it down make a whole bunch of things happen in your head that are useful before you see me do some so I try to take a couple seconds and start this on your own.  Okay, so I'm going to start working through this. I just want to make sure we get to talk about this in a consequence of it by the end of class. But I hope you got started on it. Again. We have the same the same startup as we did for the last one that I wrote out where we're matching.  These different values to how they appear.  This is a P4 and P1.  And what we're going to do is this time, we're not just going to take the max of them. We're going to square the individual answers.  So what do we get here? Well, we get again we get there 0 - -1 this -1 - 0 + a 0  Turns out to be what we get a 1 + 1 + 0 squared + 81 squared + 1 + 1 + 0 is the sum and then we take the square root of that whole thing is the answer to get to this answer for adding all the sub think I made a mistake in the calculation or step in the calculation where I skip something or wasn't clear.  Yeah.  Take the sum of everything. Yeah, so  Peppa square at first yasso way to something something go wrong in this wearing stuff going to be a little more explicit right weed is 0 - -1 * -1 - 0 squared + 0 squared write those that 1-1 that we square. And so for those three pieces then we added them up 1 + 1 + 0 ended up being two.  The other steps that ice caps are wearing clear.  I'm asking is in particular because there may be lectures where I intentionally make a mistake to try and illustrate something interesting and they're also maybe lectures where I accidentally make a mistake and by design it is going to be very hard for you to tell the difference in the steaks out to me. I do this program live in programming courses and I'm going to do it when I do math live in this course. I want you to be on the lookout for places for my descriptions on clear. I'm making mistakes. I think that this is the square root of this justifies. Why is just to get a holistic for the day so we had one too and two for these two calculations. We got the \u221a to hear for p 1 p 4 and P 1  For P4 and P2. Well, we have a Into the Fire column. We did a 1 squared in the in the Moana call him we get a 2 squared.  And in the bird box calling. We also get a two squared.  So this ends up being we had all those up. That's 1 + 4 + 4 is 9 we'd end up getting the square root of 9, which is equal to 3.  For the last one we get one squared from the from the fire column A 2 squared from the Moana column.  And a 0 squared from the bird box on this is capturing something that bothered us before which is that we didn't distinguish between to mp3s difference in opinion about Bird Box.  So these are up to five and this will give us the square root of 5 is an answer.  And we need to understand that the \u221a 5 is less than 3 but this does tell us Betsy. "
