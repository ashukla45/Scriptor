    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. So just a reminder. The first exam is Wednesday evening at 7. We put a post on Piazza with all of the details about the exam. So everything about what room is saying all that stuff is in one place on Piazza. There are sample questions that we wrote that we thought would be good for you to practice and Simple Solutions for them and a listing of some problems from the books that are interesting for practice to on that Fiat suppose. So you can use all that stuff repair. Today, what I want to do is get more into talking about Seth. We've used them a little bit in this course, we've talked about set builder notation. We talked about lifting out the content their contents with roster notation. We've talked about the truth set of predicate. So we've used sets in several ways, but we haven't defined a whole bunch of operations on sets and we haven't really worked with sets and sets was just doing operations on sats and talking about working with them directly. So they're going to be in the forest for a lot of reasons and we're going to build up more interesting domains for predicates by talking about interesting sets. So I want to spend some time diving into that today. So we're going to do some proofs about sets today. Another nice thing about them is they give us several opportunities to talk about interesting properties and then justify those properties are true or come up with counter-examples for them. And so there's a few things that I want you to have in mind when you're looking at these problems one is  that you need to be able to read the slides in order to really engage in lecture 100%  So we'll see if this works for the podcast but that's frustrating that that adapter doesn't work.  All right.  so  There's a few things I want you have in mind whenever you see these claims, right? We've been talking a lot about these Universal claims with existential claims with exist. And then we've been building a Roof Inn Universal generalization. And so there's a few things you should do whenever you're confronted with one of those properties and homework 3 is actually trying to get you to get you to think about a few of them. What is about what the statement means in English just do a little bit of sense making on the statement for what it's trying to say and then try and come up with examples of what you could provide for the variables that are in the fur all of the exist and see if that hangs together for you doesn't make sense at all. When you substitute some variables in sometimes you can even just come up with a counterexample by playing with it a little bit and trying assignments for the variables.  So I'm trying to come up with more examples. That's also a great way to generate questions for us for the course. If you say I don't understand this, but if you come to us and say I don't understand it for always this statement if I feel in this DNA strand for the first variable in this number for the second variable, I don't get what the body of that is saying we can help you a lot more. So trying to fill in the small examples are trying to do a little bit of example building yourself.  Then if you're trying to figure out if one of these things is true or false and you can't find a counterexample with a few small example, then you can start thinking about is it an existential Universal crew strategies apply here and then start trying to fix a tool that's appropriate and seeing how you can make progress. But I really want to encourage you whenever you see one of these properties. The first thing you do is try and think of some examples for the variables and try and think about what that would mean if you were to say it out loud in English just doing symbolic manipulation and diving into a proof is often not the right person to do so do a little bit of sense making first and then move on to thinking about what strategies are appropriate for the thing you're looking at a few times today.  And just to highlight the two new things we've been using is in the last couple lectures is this idea of universal generalization where the domain to prove after all and then this idea of direct proof where there's an implication and we assume the hypothesis and the conclusion of these working with for a while.  So let's move on to talk about a definition for asset and then we'll be able to talk about operations on set and do some interesting work with proofs in the future when you come in late. I'm not going to put these here because I don't like having people walking in front of me. They're going to be here.  all right, so the definition of  sets4us  is going to be that sets are collections of elements and there's a couple important things about these are a couple laughs almost like lack of properties about Seth one is that they don't have any specific order to their element there an unordered collection of elements.  Kind of implicit in this definition from the book but is also true is that they don't have any duplicate elements.  So whenever we talk about a set we'll talk about it being a collection of distinct elements and the same element can't appear more than one time and there's no specific order to the elements and there's no duplicates.  And then there's a few definitions here. These are on your hand out to First Data quality and these ideas of subsets and proper subsets because I want to get onto asking move on to ask me some questions about them.  So here's them to hear the definitions up here even refer to them and also the questions and I just want to ask which ones of these are true based on these definitions.  the 5 4 3 2 1  All right freaking again with the results of discussing this.  Okay, 5 4 3 2 1 first one the set of integers is a proper subset of the set of rational number. So that means if we want to relate these things were going to say rational numbers, but there's something that's different between the two steps. We can find some elements in one set. That's not in the other set is anything that we can write as a fraction of two integers. So this is often written is and we say numbers that we can write a Zen / M where an is an insurer and M is an integer and that the set of rational numbers is things that are 1 integer divided by another and so we can show the One Direction.  Measure then it could be a rational number. So if  and exist in the integers then and exists and Q and we can show that by saying well and over one is definitely a way to write. This is a rational number.  And that exists in Q and also the mathematical interpretation of that is the same as that the same is that integer a rational number that is not an integer and I'm sure when you were thinking about this a lot of those jumps to mind right things like 1/2 is a rational number but 1/2 is not an integer and so different.  Is that the integers are a subset of the rationals? And then this part is that there's something  that is in one of the sets but not in the other stuff. So those are the two pieces that we need to talk about being a proper something.  The next one the empty set is an element of 01 to nobody answered. Nobody picked this AC in a couple of 01 to r01 into the empty set is a subset of that that but it's not an element of it. We have to actually write the empty set is an element of it. So that's definitely not true.  Then this next plan that for all sets A and B. If a equals B, then B is a subset of a important thing here is that in subsets is the normal subset definition this one.  And I should have just use another color this ask for a subset not proper subset.  Two sets that are equal are subsets of one another are not proper subsets of one another but their stuff that's the one another because every element that exists in one does exist in the other that's true in both directions. So see is I see is true as well.  Hernandez at 40379 is a subset of the set containing 9 AFM zero definitely not true. We can identify. For example, the element 43 Yasiel in 43 doesn't isn't in the other isn't in the other side.  Okay, so this definitely doesn't work any answers not none of the above. There's two different elements are two different things that were true in this list talked about the definitions of subsets proper subset empty set.  questions about these  set the volume a bit.  And talk about a couple of planes. And actually I think there is a difference yasou on the slide that says proper subset. I'm just going to  get rid of that make it exactly match the worksheet cuz I just want to ask regular stuff. So it's not proper subsets on your sheet this matches what's on your feet now that actg is a subset of this other sac containing a a c a t a g and a specific integers to set using set builder notation of integers. I want you to just be you would use for proving none with each other just for a minute.  All right. So let's talk about this claim on the left hand side first. So first of all, let's talk about whether we think it's true or false if it's true hum.  If it's someone's head Fox.  If it's false hub.  So this claim is not true and went and what strategy do we end up using to prove it? It's not true. What's the best way to disprove this statement?  Counterexample example because the definition of subset is a universal statement. It's so if we wanted to rewrite this in terms of its definition what we get is that we're trying to show this is the subset definition for this and one thing that I often find useful if I'm trying to make these arguments about sets that are written and it'll give them names. So I might say I make all this set are in this set s rewriting out all the elements for all X and now just looking at my definition of subset here, right?  X in our implies X in s definition of subset and so that's why we have to show and so we have after all we could disprove it with a counterexample or we could prove it with universal generalization. Those are our choices and it's pretty direct to see that there's some elements in the left hand side that aren't in the right hand side so we can stay by counterexample.  Give me a counterexample. What should I choose as my counterexample?  What should I choose? What does it mean to choose a counterexample?  pentagon  true Xanax. Yeah, so give me an X. Give me an X XO by counterexample and we're choosing a specific value here. So X is equal to a then we can say look there's this very concrete thing to show which is that anr implies implies.  A n f is false, right and if we can show that that's false then we have a counterexample and this is definitely true.  by the definition of the left hand side set right just by looking at the definition of our  this is definitely false.  By definition of s we just look at us threatening roster notation. We can check it as an any of those elements that produces fall on this whole thing produces false.  I'm just riding out true and false in some cases when there's other keys and other letters were around in the problem just to be totally clear. But this is this end up being true that produces false.  So x equals a  is a counterexample  and we're done and we could if we wanted we could say something like QED to indicate to the reader that that last statement is the statement that justifies our whole claim which is that we can disprove this.  Anything that I should fix them what I wrote in the proof actually anything that I should fix there anything you'd you disbelieve or is inconsistent across what I wrote in this proof.  And I can buy you can think of one thing. That's why I'm asking I went back and looked at it and thought I can think of one thing. I would like to change about this for what I've written.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got so you're saying I wrote to show is this for all statement, but the proof is not for a statement about her proving a statement. I would have to do something at Universal generalization really what I decided to prove because I decided I was going to prove this thing is not true. I'm just proving it. I'm showing it not for all X example is the strategy for showing not for all X.  I want to be really precise about the steps. I took care right? I'm not that that proof does not demonstrate that for all Lexus is true.  Yeah, that's a good question. That's a good question. So you're saying shouldn't we even be to be even more precise shouldn't we say?  original TV show  Fred so  We'd be saying this claim is not true in our original to show is not.  Are subsets of asked we could update our to show and this would be by the definition.  Of subset, right and then we working if I was typing this up separately from the problem statement because I do but I would want to duplicate that original a statement. Let us let us but our equals this equals this set and here's our to show. Yeah. I just went on to the next step because I had the two I had the two sets written in the line above.  Okay. So right hand side right hand side. This other is subset claimed on the right hand side. I'm curious people thought it was true or false true or false. You can shut up. Just shut up the word true or false the first time anyway.  What's a counterexample for this?  the counter example  five someone said five. So again, this would be a very similar proof. I'm not going to write this one all the way out. I'm just going to sketch the pieces so we would be saying this claim is not true.  Not are subsets of ass and then we get a different to show that the Pharrell X using the definition of subset.  Subset and we'd have a counterexample.  Of x equals five and we would show that and I want to be clear about how we're defining log in this class at this point. It's really one reason to have this example up as well. Is that we Define log to be  Log base 2 that's referring to the log function that we implemented and talked about and so me to find this to be log base 2 and to be the integer log base 2. So it's the smallest bhagavate is 3 log of 5 6 and 7 is too so it's the power below the one that exactly logged. The result is to log base 2 and 5 6 7 up to the next power of 2. I'll give the results to as well, so  This is log base 2.  Rounded down or take the floor of that result.  Matches the loop that we wrote to calculate law to the beginning and end up with a log of 5 equals to 2 is not equal to 3 so it can't be an element of the set. That's the sketch. I would put more words around this but I want to make sure we get to some more examples to describe this all the way.  A couple more that I want to address. So here's a clean subset is a proper subset of every set and then the one on the right upper sunset for sunset be the empty set is an element of B.  Call Ray.  So the teaser questions to ask mainly because they force us to focus on some simple small cases, which is often useful empty cases and single element cases are often useful for us to get some practice with and understand what's going on. So let's make sure we understand how to State a claim on the left its useful to State it symbolically and we can figure out what kind of proof strategy we might use so we can rewrite the claim as saying for all sets ass.  The empty set which we could write this way and we could also write this way. I'm going to write it this way because it's written this way over here and we can see both on the same on the same slide. This is a proper subset so that the subset with a little tick mark on the bottom line.  Overall sets the empty set is a proper subset. Set up here. So we should either be trying to do a universal generalization proof, or we should be trying to find a counterexample whether we're trying to prove or disprove this statement.  empty empty set empty set example  It's interesting. The claim is.  Choose s equals empty set as a counterexample.  So now we're saying our to show is the negation of this.  So our claim is this claim is not true. This is not what we're showing that this is not a true flame. And so what were to show should be is the negation of the this for all and so tell her example is a good strategy here. So the to show that we have is that it's not true. That empty set is a subset of a proper subset of empty set.  And this is a being a easiest to show if we expand the definition of proper subsets, which tells us empty set needs to be regular subset of empty set and empty set should not be equal to empty set.  That's just just by definition of  Proper subset we look at that definition. It says to be a proper subset the two sets must not be equal and the less that must be the subset of the right set. So it's just expanding the definition in place.  And we need to show that the stuff in parentheses is false. So that its negation is true. And I think it's a we could there's a couple things we could do one thing we can say is look.  this is  obviously far-right empty set knot equals empty set their they're clearly equal. So them not being equal is is obviously false Deuce this entire clean so we would then say not empty set.  empty set and false  and we know from logical equivalence if this is the same as not false because anything and false produces full true, so we're done because what we've demonstrated here is that  s equals  is a counterexample  And these steps this is this step is really by the definition of set equality.  and this step is biological equivalence and the step is  by the definition of negation  it's worth saying that there's a there's a bit of a  there's work that I skipped if I wanted to talk in detail about the entire definition of set equality.  We could expand this thing out further. So let me just draw a little line, right we could expand this and say let's talk about the definition of equality and we have a definition of set equality, which is that for all acts acts exist in empty set. If and only if x exists in empty set and we be trying to show that because we're saying not equals right now would be by the definition of set equality. We could work through the the direction of justification for this entire statement.  And I'm choosing here to say that this step is more work.  the necessary  because  empty set knot equals empty set is clear.  And I think as a general principle if you have two sets that are written in roster notation. So these empty sets just don't list their like roster notation. It doesn't list anything and you're asking a question and you can see all the elements that doesn't need additional justification to show their equal or not equal right? We can look at the elements next to each other and just see you at The Reef or not equal right there across rotation and it's all fitting on the page in the proof. This is definitely a place where the proof is just doing a job doing a specific arguments adding is extra information about expanding out this entire definition for these two sets here doesn't really add anything to our argument of the proof. It's true. All of this is true stuff that would lead to the implication from empty set not equals mc2 getting to a false, right?  The it makes the proof harder to read with little extra information for the reader talk about like arithmetic like comparing numbers. We don't go into a deep discussion about how the integers work. Every time. We compare two numbers with greater than to arrive at a true or false for those two numbers. So some of these basic comparisons, we can see all of the values written out. It's reasonable to say look. I don't need to use the definition of set equality skipping work that it could be done. But I think the proof stays clear even without this extra work, so I would skip this work in this proof.  Any questions about that that proof that demonstration? Yeah.  see  Yeah, that's a good point. So you're saying  Theory of referring to this one right? So I think there's two ways to talk about  Account when we choose a counterexample one if I want to make the body falls by the body of the universal fall the other is I want to make the negation of that true and here I wrote them in there and I ended up trying to make the whole thing true at the end.  Yeah, yeah, so it also I think both both things are clear demonstrations of the counter example of false or true and think this is a counterexample could actually be useful in different cases. Cuz sometimes litigation might let you rewrite The Logical formula in a nice way to demonstrate it things like that. So both are reasonable ways to demonstrate your question now, both of those are reasonable ways to demonstrate.  And I want to move on to the examples on the back of the sheet. So I'm just going to be clear about the statement here the to show here if we wrote this symbolically would be there exists. So it's saying for some there exists some set B.  It sucks that empty set is an element of be empty set is an element of be in here. We need a witness because we're trying to prove an existential and this ends up being a true statement and so we can choose.  a witness here  Which is a b equals and there's two ways we could write be we could also write this as being equals and draw the empty set this way, but the idea is that b is a set and one of the elements of B is a set.  Sophie is a set. One of the elements of B is a set and then we can see that the empty set is an element of that food demonstrate that this is a good Witness.  So let's play Miss false because the empty set a subset of every set but not a proper subset of every set and then the right clean is true. We definitely can construct this that be that just has the empty set is at element.  I want to talk about these other definitions that are on the back of one of them is Cartesian product. We talked about that when we started building up these multi-element domains are these domains that related multiple values definition definition of power set the talks about all of this. So the definitions on The Right Use Union intersection Cartesian product and difference and I just want to ask which of those instructions on the right using these operations yields sets that have the same elements that are equal stats.  5 4 3 2 1  Just got this one briefly.  Okay quick and again and again.  5 4 3 2 1 the results of operations just so we can just so we can compare to this first operation that does the cross product for the Cartesian product important thing to remember about Cartesian product is it is producing this set of pairs. So it takes two sets and produces a set of pairs of their elements. So number one ends up producing a set that looks like the pear 4309 depair 43a DePere Nine-Nine & The Pear 9A  Is a couple things just worth worth mentioning here. You might say wait, that's not allow. There's a duplicate element in that set.  That's not allowed. There's a duplicate element in that sense. But this is just a pair that happens to have Nine and Nine is the two elements of the ordered pair that element is not equal to any of the other elements in the set. Right? So it's not equal to the pair 43 a not equal to the pair 43:9 not equal to the pear 9A. It's a distinct element of the set.  So this is not a duplicate element in a set. Just a pair that happens have the same value and its first and second position did the results of the Cartesian product different type than all of the other operations.  Union produces a new set that contains  What contains?  43 nine and a note that when I write out that result, I'm not putting two nines in the result because that would be a duplicate says no need to write it down twice the meaning of writing down the same value in the set twice would just be I'm riding out to a single 943 9 and a is the result of this Union.  the result of the intersection is just  The set containing nine the only element that was common between no sets is the element nine common and then the final the final results. We take the elements on the left hand side. And we remove any elements that are on the right hand side that were in the left-hand side that would remove 9 and the results of this would be the set containing just 43.  That's the meaning of this.  The sex not envy here so that element has to not be in the right hand set in order to be included in this at difference. So none of these are different elements in comparing them would not would not produce any of those definitions questions about those. Yeah.  Why is a knot in the set different? That's a great question. So if we look at this definition, there's two things that are required.  The element has to be in the left-hand set and it has to not be in the right hand set. And so if we think about the element a here  rat we be asking is a n  43 nine and is a in nine not in 9 a trip.  Okay, so let's go onto a sort of claim and I like this claim because it is not immediately obvious at all whether this claim is true or false.  I at least I think so. I think it's not obvious at all. Whenever this whether this claim is true or false of these elements of the power set of the set containing the elements 1 2 3 4 5 and make sure we understand what I'm feeling that Top Line where the blank is 4 minute talk about it try and fill in a little bit of what that is and we'll talk about what it is and understanding of the stat 1 2 3 4 5  All right, so I went to there's not a ton of time left. So I'm in a I'm going to talk through some of this without as much asking questions for just a few minutes. The definition of power that says this is all the sets. We usually write sets with capital letters. And so it's all the sets X such that X is a subset.  acid in this case ass is this 1 2 3 4 5 set if we were to fill it into this definition for this going to move this a little bit below the line for a minute to talk about another way we could write this out if we wanted to think about what does it mean a set of all the stats acts that are subsets of 1 2 3 4 5  so it's a set.  And every element in it is also a set every elements and it is also a set.  And the empty set is definitely a subset of this one, two, three, four five cent. So that's one such capital X.  And then we start to co the set containing just one is definitely a subset of this 1 2 3 4 5 set because it has a subset of the elements.  2 is  thesaurus to the set containing two is the set containing three is  the set containing 4 in the set containing 5 is  the set containing 1 and 2 is the set containing 1 and 3 the set containing 1 and 4 and this keeps going for a while such a pretty big a fairly large stats compared to the original size of 5 a lot of elements in here and we go all the way out until we had listed all the combinations of the elements from one two, three, four five each has an individual set with the member of this power set.  Powers that operation talks about this entire collection of subsets of a particular set. That's what powers that means and it's really all this set of all these combinations that are possible. It's only right W here in this claim what we're saying, is that a B and C are something in that big list of steps that we made out of combinations of the elements 1 2 3 4 5. That's really what this w means that are in this big set. W.  If the union of A and B is equal to the union of A and C then B is equal to speed.  If the union of A and B is equal to the union of antsy then B is equal to C.  So there's a couple choices here and there's two there's two things that I would immediately start thinking about when I see this property written down one is maybe I can do a proof by Universal.  generalization where I'll pick an ABC that are arbitrary elements of this set W and start thinking about if I can prove his property using arbitrary B&C the other is I might disprove  by counterexample  and that would mean picking some specific values for a b and c and trying them seeing what happens if we plug them in into this into this from into the statement. So what are some values we can give me some suggestions and they don't have to but I just want to tell you yeah.  So one example is a is one two three, four five trying to do a counterexample. These are just some examples and I think you said a b equals 3/5.  And you said C equals 4545?  And so then we can plug in these values right and we be talking about then let's talk about this statement with these values plugged in and I make myself just a little bit more space a little bit more space so I can right below here and then we could turn this into a proof in a minute. So this would be saying one two, three, four five.  Union 3/5 equals  1 2 3 4 5 Union for 5 all of that implies that  3 V is equal to 4/5.  That's kind of interesting because we can immediately see when we plug in these values that I picking a different b a b and c that are different the conclusion of this implication is false write definitely the case that 3-5 is not equal to 4/5 evaluates the truth. So it may not be a counterexample yet. We have to talk about evaluating the hypothesis.  when we evaluate the the hypothesis and simplify this Union by the definition of union this turns into just 1 2 3 4 5 equals 1 2 3 4 5 and all of that is supposed to "
