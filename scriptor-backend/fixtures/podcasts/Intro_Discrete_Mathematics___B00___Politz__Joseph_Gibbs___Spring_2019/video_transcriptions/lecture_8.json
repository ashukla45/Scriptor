    "Full Transcript": "All right, let's get started. Happy Wednesday everybody. So today what we're going to do with logical operators to Value Beyond everything we've done so far with logical operators. I really just focused on putting those things together and working with proposition that represent statements that have yes, no answers and a lot of things which set of operations on values that involve numbers and strings and other structures. The way we're going to Define this in the way, we're going to build this up this idea of what we're going to call a predicate and what a predicate does it takes in which could be numbers. I could be some kind of other structure that were interested in talking about and produces a true or false value these propositional formulas or compound prepositions. We've been talking about the compound prepositions had a bunch of propositional variables true or false priests propositional variables. And now we're saying that a predicate takes in values from some domain that we specify and then produces true or false. I'm so this is going to generalize this idea. We've been working with I'm very concretely what this means for us is that we can start to think about extending the tables. We've been drawing with not just true and false values in the column numbers in the columns. In this case. I'm going to start interpreting them as numbers right now. I just have three lengths bit strings in it and then we can talk about their interpretation the different number representations we have so this there's several credit gets here. There's several credit gets here that I've written and I'm writing them in the same sort of sentence is X represents a positive number in with three two's complement X represents a positive number and with three twos compliment and you can see the True Values. After that are exactly when is greater than zero.  And if not, where is greater than zero, so it's not any of the negative numbers were that leading bit is 1 indicating that it's negative. And since we said positive we can have a false in the room.  I'm so we're in this case. If we're just talking about these bit strings are these sequences of bits that are of length 3 leather cases for the input. These are all of the Three Links things that I could be so much like some of the truth tables we've been drawing. This is pretty complete view of all the values we could care about. So if we're going if we want to talk about ex representing a negative number in with three twos complement we can fill in the truth values for that as well that's going to be false for  These first four rows and then true.  When there's a 1 in the leading those represent the negative numbers in with three twos conflict.  What is the last column represent? What would you write for the sentence if you wanted to talk about this last column is a predicate. What would you write? I'm going to want to see him.  Okay hands him. What's this was that it would be the English description of this predicate in the last column.  X is an even number X is an even number. I have other descriptions or want to refine that in anyway, yeah.  X is not odd. Alright. Otherwise you want to describe it is actually a bunch of just those two might open up a door. Talking about more.  X Animals full of two others others  Yeah.  sp200  is 0 an even number and zero is an even number because we Define even numbers as multiples of 2 and so we can multiply 2 by 0 and get zero so that I mean that's that makes a bunch of things work. Well in other definitions we care about with the managers number for that reason. Yeah, so there's a lot of ways we could write this which is pretty interesting and has a lot of ways we could write this down and also one thing that's interesting is no one said this extra thing that's at the end of both of these predicate which is that in with three two's complement which is kind of interesting like the first number does it matter if we which interpretations we pick 4 if x has an even-numbered we have to pick two's complement.  We have two pictures compliment for to make sense that X is an even number is what does predicate mean?  Any other representations where is also would be even?  Clear what I'm asking for all the first for the first two columns in with three to compliment.  and one of the first descriptions we got was x's and even number do I have to add more information here to make this true or their representation for this is true and true versus not being true for the number representations we talked about  Squeeze Inn  What what representations make this? Okay, talk about disrespect and what representations would make this true representations of numbers that make this trip.  Okay, sweetheart. We have to talk about several representations of numbers in binary. Which one for which ones would this be true for which ones would this be true representations minor?  So you're saying maybe not in one's complement people generally agree that a nun if it was unsigned fixed with these numbers would be even interpreting them. That way it was unsigned fix with two's complement fixed with their are all even if we interpret according to the matches, but even 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 7 1 compliment doesn't work, but this would work for both.  Two's complement with three and it would also work in unsigned.  with three woodworking sign magnitude woodworking sign magnitude  sign magnitude  do you think this would be the even wrote the trews represent even numbers in sign magnitude hum?  If you think it doesn't hum.  Who silenced next time we're just looking at the magnitude of vector there and so like 00 for the one that I've circled. That's that's going to be even as well. It also works in sign magnitude with three.  And we can think about this predicate in the number of ways we can think about it. As one of these it's even in any of these we can think about is even in all of these we could even say well it's even in all of these representations 0 it not be odd it being about I'm so there's lots of his ways we can describe the predicate and so I wanted to make this point because this definition on your worksheet to Braddock. It's over the same domain are equivalent means they evaluate to the same truth values are equivalent for all of those things having zero in the least significant fit being even into compliment interpretation being even in the unsigned with 3 interpretation, all of us are equivalent.  A lot of ways to say the same thing for thinking about different representation.  So I won't have to question next which is I'm just going over to the next row on your hand out. I was this is just the road next to the row for the even after the even number and address intrusion. And so I just want to ask you this question something to do a silent around first and then have you discussed what's a good English description or a good predicate description and I'm in an assumed that were interpreting acts as with three two's complement for this Buster going to assume.  five four  3  2  1  Okay, quick it again picking again.  five four  321 a lot of people converged on who can very funny and yeah, we can certify and if I'm cases that don't match all of a b c and d so if we want to look at a says represents an odd number, but here we have a true40 x represents a non- number but here we have a negative number. We have X represents the number that is even in positive. But here we have a number that's positive X represent. The number that is not positive. It is not negative.  Movie about positive and negative numbers here. So none of these actually fit we generate when we made this lecture. We generated this table of randomly picking cruising faucets. This is a perfectly reasonable predicate definition. It's just these are the values for which we produce truth. These are the values for which reproduce boss listed in table form, but there isn't a great English description that I can find that that matches these very well aside from just sort of listing of the particular values that produce true but it's where we just to find them by saying. Well here's where is true and here's words fall perfectly valid definition of a predicate.  I'm going to just make up a name here. I'm going to call it our cuz it was a little bit random how we came up with it. This is just a predicate are of excellent stay and it's defined by this table. I saw him up in the middle.  100 in twos compliment 100 is most negative number that can be represented. So it's the largest negative number. So did he end up being 3 or so if we sort of glossing over doing out the math for a while that works out what 100 is the most negative number you can represent ends up working out that way to compliment. I don't want to do the math formula and you end up getting a base to the W - 1 but negative and then all ones into stop limit is -1 represent.  1000 into compliment  Yeah, so one of the reasons one of the reasons we prefer to compliment over one's complement when building machines and doing low-level work is that only has one representation of zero unlike one compliment and sign magnitude representation 1002 not represent.  You should be exactly the same. So they they they have the same domain and for every value in that domain they have the same truth value.  So none of so on this line.  These three columns are not equivalent. None of this none. No pair of these columns is equivalent. But if we talked about the predicate x's and even number in with three two's complement and I went through another column and kept the predicate x's and even number in unsigned with three binary then and all the values in the rows of the same and all the truth values match exactly.  Ask another question. So for this for this example, so different values of the rightmost column that you have on your sheet, which of these which of these products matches this columns description.  5 4 3 2 1  Okay.  I'm not going to do another round on this one. If we I'm just I just want to talk through a few of the interesting cases. Here's the same for English descriptions that we had on the last question and X definitely doesn't represent a nonzero number cuz again zero is included and zeros. In fact, the only thing that's true here.  There's a bunch of non-negative numbers that aren't true here. So be can't be can't work. There's a bunch of even and positive numbers that aren't true. So she cannot work that is exactly the case where if it's not positive and not negative then the only number that fits is Europe. So the answer here is the D matches this description.  Any questions about the answer D here or applying any of the other any of the other cases for this for this question?  So I want to move on to another definition about predicate sister useful definition about credit gets that helps us talk about them. And so the definition is this idea of the set of values for which a predicate is true that make the predicate true. And really this is a piece of vocabulary that will end up using will say things like well, it's in the truth set of this predicate so we know it's Sarah so truth said just it's just a piece of vocabulary. We need to know and so if we take that first X represents a positive number in with 3 to compliment, I just put... So it wouldn't fit on one line. Then the truth set of that of that predicate is the value the value is in the domain our that produces true which in this case are  That's awesome. Which in this case r001?  010 and 011 those are the three values that are in the domain the domain only has these eight elements in it. And those are the three values where there's a truth Untold just a disappointing notation. I'm using curly braces and putting the values in curly braces with commas in between them.  I'm not sure if I've written that sat on the board yet. It was on the first day notation notation page, but I just want to be clear about.  So I want to I want to write something for this second blank to also do a little bit of notation. One of the cats is not an income up with shorthand for writing out these long English sentences that we write because it's annoying to write out every time.  Things like the English sentence X represents a positive number in with three twos complement. Every time we want to do this you've see I already have two... It out cuz it wouldn't fit on a slide Define. Let's define p of x  is  X is a positive number.  And we're going to use this notation of usually a capital letter within a variable in parentheses definition. They were kind of function. This also looks like an is the function definition Define anti-vax, which is X is a negative number.  And in both of these it's useful to be precise because I've been trying to be precise with his representation. Let's stay in with three two's complement for boat.  So now we written out the long description of the long description first, and now we can use these these predicate fees definition of these short hands to write out other other predicate is one that relates to the last question we asked which is that the number is  not  positive  And not negative.  This is the kind of thing we can write when we want to express something that uses the results of multiple fatty compound compound proposition that uses predicate and it produces now we can talk about putting X in here and getting truth values out except for this predicate if we're assuming the same domain fees with three twos complement number for this predicate.  Okay, shout it out or have this what's the truth set for this predicate?  020  This is notational another way. We can express. Predicate. We just saw on the last where we just had the zero and the English sentence. We had was x's and number that's not positive and not negative. I want to make a quick Point here. It was actually on the slide last lecture, but it went by really fast on that slide about logical logical identities, and I want to just right here below this that is not  pfx or anavex  And I know the parentheses I put the not outside the parentheses in the or inside the parentheses and I want you to think about this for a minute. I'm not saying whether I did exactly the thing that was on the identity slide is the predicate I wrote below logic.  Is it equivalent predicate to the one above are those two predicates equivalent, do they produce the same results in all the same case equivalent packet?  Okay. Okay, so  If you think that these are not equivalent, so there's some case where they would have different truth values for the same the same and put X hump. So they're not equivalent.  If they are hum, so this is this is maybe you saw it on maybe you threw out the truth table was you could do to prove this to yourself. Maybe you saw it on the logical identity slide in your remembering it but it's generally a property that for any two propositional variables are compound proposition and not why is equivalent to not X or Y name this is called demorgan's law identities that has a really it's named after a person being used to talk about this. And positive not negative relationship.  I would say the argument would be the demorgan's law you use de Morgan's law to demonstrate it. And if you wanted in the proof for tomorrow are the demonstration for the Morgan is just the the four rows of the truth table for both of these two were both of these two propositions that would show  so that's a bit of notation. We're going to use these capital letter to find functions as a convention for predicates in a number of places. We have these curly braces with, separated values for sets and we have a bulary of Truth sets that we're going to use to talk about the inputs to predicates that produce true.  I want to talk about another example of a predicate.  Which is a predicate over this different domain of colors and we've been working with these hex colors even working with him and homework, we've been using them as examples to be out of class stuff. And so I want to talk about a couple predicate skier one. Is that Caesar? The color sea is a gray color my gray. I mean we could show it in grayscale. Like it only needs it only needs like in black-and-white basically. And so what I have here is on the table, I'm skipping a bunch of Rose now. I want to see if you think about this table. This table is definitely finite. There's only 16 to the 6th Rose 16 to the 6th, right? That's all right. That's a very big number but if we had enough paper or a big enough projector, we could draw all of the Rose we can write out all of the road.  Table, I forgot. So I can fit on a slide and we can sort of do a little bit of work with a table. That's too big to work with us. We could imagine having these 16 to the 6 rows each with a true or false in it based on what I have written for the true and false values here though. I'm a question I want to ask is how would we write down the truth set for this thing? We said that's our youth away to talk about it. It's nice to be able to talk about the set of values that produce true hear what kind of ideas can we have? Those of you can see my slide notes in the front row can see it says write down set builder notation here. So maybe that's a that's a bit of a what would you try if you wanted to write down the truth set here. How would you describe it either in English or in set notation or some other notation, you know.  Truth set for the predicate see is gray or sea is greyscale. Especially based on seeing you serve how I feel.  All right.  So in the interest of time, I'm going to give an answer for this and not solicit lots of answers and do a lot of discussion, but I wanted to give you the chance to think about this on your own before I just write the answer on the board is I would use I would use.  Right, so I would say these are the exes.  Or at least call them species since I use see you in the left-hand side C.  So actually I'm going to use a little more notation and sometimes I use for this example. So I'm going to say these see is a hex color for our definition of hex colors that we've been using so we can talk about that definition of a hex color.  And what what do we want to be true like an English? What do we want to be true about the color for it to be in this that for to be a member of the predicate?  What did you come up with four things you want to describe? Yeah.  R1 R2 pools G1 G2 equals B1 B2 interesting in the way you were talking about losing your discussion, but that's interesting. We haven't talked really about equals in terms of our logical operator education. We bought all these operation equals equals intrusion faucets the kind of suggestion. A lot of people I think we're going to have here is to say things like R1 R2 equals G1 G2 that the components are equal and  G1 G2 equals  B1 B2 and we might even want to be very precise here and say that the blues are also equal to the Reds.  And we could argue about the properties of equals right I'm saying right now. I'm taking equals to be some operation to take two numbers and produces true or false depending on if they're the same number we could argue about different properties that equals might have but I want to be clear here that this is a new operation and we have to interpret it mathematically, but it's mathematical operation is producing a true or false hear that were using in this logical way.  But this is to be clear about what this means in terms of colors. This is just saying all the red component components are all the same. I was just in color land means that no colors going to stand out. This is going to be some intensity between black and white and be a gray.  That's really interesting question is how does equal differ from the biconditional is another way we said it. When did Arrow operation Jose equals different operation or biconditionals or if it only works on true and false values right here if we were equals here is like this math operations math equality, but evaluating to true or false in math in general some different meanings. I'm defining these predicate, but I just wanted to see what I mean by we're checking if the numbers are equal in producing true or false.  Yes, I think so. You're saying you're arguing something where you're saying if I know that one of these is equal to another and then there is a quality that I know I'm trying to be very just be very precise. You're not assume too much about how we reason about equals and just saying I want all three comparisons. I want to know that these are really all equal now if we could argue about what properties people house and maybe write a large maybe writing equivalent predicate but looks shorter. So this is one way we can talk about the truth set for see is gray when we can talk about it after the after the pipe in the  Set builder notation is also a way to think about Define the expression. We might use to define this predicate. We were trying to write a definition like one of these we might write an expression over here to describe it for a compound proposition in this is the kind of thing.  So that's how we talked about that. Truth set you to think next about this other predicate bitsy has equal red and green red and green components. And so just take a minute red and green component. Then I want to make an observation about that.  Okay, so I want just Shout It Out answers first row true or false.  Second row that was cool.  That's what just happened.  3rd row true or false  all all rows where I listed a specific value for C. True or false.  Is this true for all the rows in the really big table that has 16 to the 6th? What's an example where it's not true?  Pant pant and I won't be able to hear 6 digits.  Yeah, go ahead.  I got that maybe I would have written that up here at those writing things in complete order. But yeah, so for this one it is neither gray nor are the red and green component. I want to make this important point to make here which is when you're thinking about a big but finite domain, right so this is a large but finite domain  And by large really all I mean here I probably shouldn't say large. There's lots of relative sizes of finite domain. It doesn't fit on a piece of paper and you write some examples of it. You need to be aware that you might you definitely need to be exploring outside. Those examples thinking about representative examples in different ways would be easy to write a bunch of examples for all of the examples. He wrote down and think that it might be true for everything but we need to think about these interesting examples.  This is also going to set us up for thinking about claims that we might want to make like this predicated actually true in every row in a table or this predicate is actually false in all the rows in the table and things like that. So that's the last thing I want to talk about it today is two ideas that relate to talking about all the rows in a table for a particular predicate. So there's two definitions here one is what we call Universal quantification and there's just some notation and language around this. This is what we're just going to let us make statements like for all of the values in the domain.  The predicate is true. So the truth that is all the values in the domain and existential pontification. Let's just make sentence statements. Like there's some value in the domain. That means there's one row that has true in it somewhere the truth that is not completely empty for the predicate.  So just in terms of a picture if we talked about whether we can sit would like to find a positive number assuming with three twos complement. Then we would just look at this column underneath the predicate and ask are all the rose true in this case this statement true because we see some of these impulses here. So it's not true that for all x x is a positive number.  Enters and we can find any road that has a false in it. And this is a counterexample to this claim. So we asked you to provide evidence that a statement or Universal quantification. Is it true we can find a row in the table that has Falls for that predicate. That's a counter example that demonstrates that they can't possibly be as universal statement future.  Existential statement says we need to find some row that's true in order to have evidence for the existential statement. And there's another vocabulary word. We use here which is some road has true in it. I'm is a witness for that existential statement. So if we wanted to talk about the existential statement of there being a positive number there definitely is where the predicate is true. There's some positive number in this domain.  The main thing I want to be really clear about how we're going to start over the next few days and for all statements when you can at least four things that have finding domains, you can think about them just as this question about columns in a table. There's going to be this is going to be in a table and we're going to look at a particular column for a predicate and see if all those values are true or one of those values is true. And that's how we're going to reason about these before. I was an existing tiles.  What do a few examples with these to try using them and make sure we can work with this notation? So first I just want to be really precise about what what it means when we ask for a counterexample and Witnesses. So this is this predicate which is going to be even again in this fixed with two complement representation more than using a counterexample for this.  4  400EX  EFX  Is a shout-out what's a counterexample for this?  counterexample for this  counterexample  001 as an example. So any odd number is a counterexample for this.  and then a witness for  there exists an X such that X is even is any even number so something like 0 1 0  so Witnesses are the 4 x 4 existentials and give us his positive information is summer exist counter examples of this negative information looking for false prefer. All of it shows that it can't possibly be true for all columns. I want to talk about a couple different predicate. She was going to be a x represents 3MP is going to be the X represents a positive number for all statements directions of Q & M V P of x + P of x + 5 q of x to think about which of these are all axes in the stable something about this.  some of that in the first round in 5 4 3 2 1  Okay quick in again with the results of discussing this.  k543  21 so there's some few things going on here one is thinking thinking about implication any other is thinking about this new for all notation.  The other is a flickering projector.  So if we take the we take the first option A what we're doing and see if we can find a row where this would be foster if this would be true for every row.  Just add a column here for a q of X implies P of x.  and the First Tee of x  and so one of the interesting things about implication that we saw is if the the the proposition on the left side of the arrow or the first part is false, then the implication is always true. So all of the Rose  where X represents three is false or true in this implication.  But the roller X represents three, we have to check this value and implication is true. If the what's the first part the part before the arrow is true and the part after his crew. So this is also true. This actually gives a little bit of a justification for why is Define the way it is for all x if x is 3 then X is a positive number sounds very reasonable rate that sentence sounds very reasonable. Right and one of the ways this sort of work that we get the trews for free in all the cases where are assumption doesn't hold right. So if it's not 3:00, then we're not really interested in inspecting the conclusion for those rows or just going to get the true for this.  Vacation until this sort of justify why we have this may be funny looking rule for implications because otherwise we just kind of sentence sentence is really a reasonable sentence to want to talk about and then X represents three definitely not true. Right there's lots of numbers that are positive and aren't 3 until any of these roads were that's the case. So for example This One X is positive but is not three example for B. We'd end up having a false in that case for beef.  so the main points of this lecture are "
