    "Full Transcript": "All right.  Let's see.  Maybe  oh shoot.  Let's get started.  We're going to practice problems happy to answer those. I will not be taking any questions regarding what is on the final exam everything. You need to know about what?  It's already been discussed.  Okay, so I'm going to do the problems and then Street Hari one of our teeth.  Will any questions before we get started?  Oh, that's just for me. I'll write it up.  That is a little small, huh?  Okay, and then I'll say it. I'll speak it to.  Yes.  It's up all the way now.  Okay, cool.  Shri Hari, I left my notes in my office. Can you go get them?  Yeah, I'll just watch your stuff.  okay, so the first one is  DFS on a dense graph  runtime  big'o of B squared true or false  in fact  Is always bigger.  What's the reasoning behind that?  Right. He is always going to be Big O of the square.  and Todd DFS runs  and figure out of the Plessy  so that's at most Big O of the square questions about that.  Okay, next one.  supposed to supposed  f and g f and g are positive values increasing integral function to to the G of n  If you're if you're unsure then why don't you why don't we go through kind of the steps of the definition? What does it mean for what to the event to be Big O to the G event. This means that two to the F of n is less than or equal to C * 2 to the G event.  For all right.  For some stripper some constancy.  What happened?  That doesn't change the inequality and we get  log of 2 to the F of n  less than or equal to log of C to the G event.  And so that shows you that half of n is now less than equal to Steve + G of then weight loss.  log seat  if you know that.  Mike c2g event  So after the end is big old you then any questions about that?  Yes.  function value function  integer value functions  I basically just put that because you know, you can get some weird weird things. If it's not it doesn't follow these kind of nice rules and most of the functions that we see in this respect have are for the positive valued increasing integer functions operations.  Okay next question.  If a connected undirected graph has two edges that both have the minimum weight than the graph has two distinct minimum spanning trees.  false  so I guess  you can just come up with a counterexample and basically have both of those minimum weight be important for the minimum spanning tree, right?  connected undirected graph  I mean I can just this could be a counterexample.  I don't know if anybody was tricked by that one or anybody has any questions.  Okay. How about number four?  If a problem is in NP, then there is no known polynomial time algorithm to solve it.  Why is it false?  Right because p is a subset of n p and p is the set of all things all problems that have a polynomial.  So the falsity of the statement is that this is true in general for all problems in NP.  Ask me for all power questions about that.  next one  if you perform Explorer on a dag starting at a stores and ending out of  this is Paul strength.  Sure.  you can have like  something like  maybe  I mean like this and then there's another source over here.  Install if you start at us stores that you're not going to reach everybody.  Only has one source then.  You will reach everybody right?  If the dog only has one source, then you can reach all the vertices from that stores.  This one has two sources right has the stores in that source.  I mean you could even if you like you can do something like that.  Well, I mean you can  now it's all connected.  But there's two sources so I can't get from one to the other.  questions about that  So which ones?  like this  true  because it says I'm asking if you perform Explorer starting at the stores, will you reach everything physically, is there a path from the source to every other vertex?  All right.  How about this one a grass that has a psycho with a unique lightest Edge than he has to be part of all minimum spanning trees.  true  good way to justify most of them is with argument contradiction argument. So suppose.  there  Is a minimum spanning tree?  without this Edge  Let me get myself a little bit more room here.  supposed  There is a MST without.  Edge  I'm trying to do some sort of exchange. One of these Edge is a unique minimum if it doesn't include.  At least one of the other than the cycle, let's say it includes this one.  Or maybe a better way to say it is.  I o let's do this.  Escola sem stt.  Right when you created cycle.  remove  other Edge  in the cycle  and you get  a lighter  Spanning tree that's a contradiction cuz you assumed it was a minimum spanning tree and now you found a lighter Spanish chorizo.  any questions  Okay 7.  And plus and minus to plus and minus 4... + 2 is Big O of n true or false.  This is false.  Anybody know why?  And I guess what you can do is you can show that it's big.  questions about that  So this is the definition of big.  was that like if you had  If you had two functions.  Is less than or equal to some constant times the other?  the one with the  the second function the one inside big of kind of like dominate the other functions if you can multiply by a big enough number.  so  at the end is equal to  big Omega  pubg event  This is just the same thing same.  Just opposite.  If both of these are true.  Kind of like fixators like sort of they kind of grow at the same rate except for maybe some constant multiple.  questions about this one  Okay, next one.  To the endless to the end - 1 +... + 1 is this big ole to the end?  Yes, right. So we should all know now that this is the geometric series with route to and we should all know how to get the closed form, which is 2 to the n + 1 - 1.  Any questions about that?  Okay, good. It is always better to use to keep structure in dijkstra's true or false.  This is false. And if you're talking about it being better meaning that it's more more efficient, right because on a very very dense graph.  Using a priority queue as a heap.  Will run slower than if you use an array.  change song  keep  let's call it Dykstra dykstra's.  with teeth takes what Big O of  log V.  And with a red  it takes big O of B squared.  So if  Is Big stata of the squared?  then sheep takes  Big O of B squared log B  slower than b squared  any questions  Okay, last one is two problems are both NP complete and one has a polynomial time algorithm for the also. The other one also has a polynomial time algorithm true or false.  true, right  Yes.  Sure.  are both  NP complete  what does it mean to be NP complete first of all?  This implies that is in mp and BP is in mp.  What else does it imply?  It's harder than the hardest Auntie but what what kind of like the formal definition of NP complete?  all problems and NT reduced to  a problem in NP complete. So this also means that all NP problems.  reduce to a  and to be right  in particular problems  and be reduced to say  okay, so if one of them has a polynomial time solution  suppose  she has a polynomial time solution.  Since a reduces to be that implies that a also has a polynomial time solution.  questions  What's that?  number 7  No, it's false.  question  Oh shoot.  I just tricked myself.  alright, so this is  this is fall.  Thank you for that.  if you had  I say all of these are one of these are all 10.  5 is actually the  lightest Edge on this cycle  on that particular cycle  But the minimum spanning tree is this one.  so if it's supposed thinking  About writing but I didn't write it.  was if it said if  if he is a unique lightest Edge in all of its Cycles  naked  so let's move on.  So I'll just I know this is so small that it's hard to read but I just put that up there for me.  You want to know if you have some undirected?  You have a directed graph.  And you have vertices S&T you want to know if there is a that's not necessarily simple also a multiple of three links multiple of 3.  Okay, so the way to approach this kind of problem or at least for me is to do some sort of reduction. So we're going to change the graph around.  We've seen things like this like on the homework or we did like the alternating 1-0 pass. Remember we made two copies of the vertices in my Solutions. I made two copies of the vertices and 0 edges one way. All one is is the other way.  So think about this idea.  make  starlink 3 special one way to do that is to make three copies of all the vertices.  Let me do it. Let me give you an example.  Okay, so let's say hey goes to be.  Hey goes to see we have d.  And maybe he goes to die2.  in fact goes to see  okay.  which one of these vertices has a  Maybe we need more.  I don't know it's fine. Okay. So how do we build this graph? We're going to make three copies of each vertex. Okay. So we have one copy is a b c c.  Kate the second copy is going to be a b c d e f in the third copy ABC  Okay now.  If I original graph, where do I put it in my new grass?  Edge from A to B in my original, how do I represent in my  Okay, so these are the zeros the ones in the tooth.  If you add three edges for every Edge, I'll just do a few more. So a also goes to see so you have a to see a to c c to a  a2c  Better to do this problem on like a cylinder.  details  is basically these vertices as like the 0 mod 3.  1 mod 3  and 2 mod 3  I'll just give you the idea and then we'll explore at your starting vertex. But say it unless they are ending vertex is f if we can reach F on the 09 3 side from a  Think about it because in order to get the only way to get there is to do something to your number of time. So I'll something to dream multiple of 3.  stop formally we'd say something like  create  graph  G Prime by  Using I guess.  3  coffee  of each  vertex V  v-0 V1 and V2  stand for  every Edge  UV  create edges  u0 the one  you won the two.  and YouTube  YouTube v-0  run Explorer  from s  0  If t 0 is visited.  return  true else  return  false  this is going to be enough of a high-level description.  It's clear what you're doing. You don't have to go into all the details of how you created the graph you've given enough enough instructions on when there should be an edge in your new grass and when there shouldn't be right and then  We're just running Explorer as is we're not changing it at all. It's kind of why I prefer doing it this way rather than  altering the algorithm.  Kind of like a brief.  idea of the proof  Okay. So in One Direction, I want to say supposed.  there is a  multiple  of 3 blank  Pat  let's say that the length of the path is equal to some 3K or something.  I guess from from essity from s to T in the original craft.  Stop. I'm trying to go in the forward direction or One Direction. Just sang suppose this path exists. Algorithm output. True it better.  stop  you can think of Peace starting at s.  Let's say it just starts at s and then we go V1 V2 all the way up to v3k and then T. I have one too.  3 K - 1 Frank, you know.  Cuz it goes to V1 to V2.  right  because she is like the 3 case.  protect that you reach  edges  I guess I'm this is going to be messy because now I'm using subscript for the bees and I already used it for the other things, but will will take care of it.  vertices  Does 3K edges in between?  Okay.  So this what is this path look like in in my new graph G Prime?  enji Prime  We have like this peep rhyme which is equal to s0. I'm just going to put a subscript v11 V-22 all the way up to v3k - 120 you're going to get there.  So I'll put through.  Okay, and then the other direction is kind of like a carbon copy of mirror of this one. So if you start with a path that goes from s0220 and then has to be of length 3 K - 3K and then that will correspond to a rational graph.  pick any questions  you can do a alteration a modification of the algorithm if you like.  The little bit more message but essentially doing the same thing. It's just that you're kind of running Explorer and instead of keeping one visited. You keep three visit erase you visit from a even a visit from a multiple of three you think about it? You're sexually doing the same thing.  next problem divide and conquer  Okay, so you basically want to find the the heaviest path of even length.  And so  if R is just a leaf then.  You can just have a path.  of length of 00 is even  return  WR  what if what if  has two children  and then those children don't have any children.  if R. R C & R. LCR  leaves  return  WR  These are kind of the base cases. I guess if returned.  We even have to do that case now.  We'll never get to that right cuz Diesel take care of it. So what happened in the general case so we have are here right? It has to in order to get a even number that's bigger than zero. You need to get to the grandchildren, right?  Which grandchild do I choose if I'm looking for the heaviest path hanging from trees?  Write these guys all have their own trees set. And so I'm going to recursively call those children to figure out what their heaviest path. Is that hangs from them.  Call this thing in the solution tree.  So even tree of some fruit.  Okay, so do the bass cases, right?  and then  so basically want to do a recursive call on each one of the grandchildren.  solat LLB  even tree  r. R l c l c l r tree of r. L c e r c and so on.  You can use those to figure out what's the best path right? Make sure that you're considering these intermediate notes.  So, let me just write out a more kind of formal description and then I'll take some questions.  Okay, so  Define even pass or did I call it even tree?  even tree of our to be the max  wait  any  even length  starting  from  Give a sense of this is what I expect this thing to return because I'm going to be calling it recursively. So those recursive call or supposed to be giving me that information from whatever vertex. I call it from k u r bass cases.  Which will be if far is Alief?  return wor  if r. R c r. L c r leaves  return WR  recursively  call  even tree  on  all four  ARS grandchildren  Call them l l l r r L & R R then take.  the max  so  if I choose LL or LR left child Plus  the max of LL in LR  and the weight of the right child plus Max of rlrr.  And return the result.  any questions  what school?  I think that I think that'll work fine. So what he was saying was you keep track of two values the longest and the longest even passed from every vertex and then you can kind of like  Swap as you go up.  any other comments or  Oh, here's my pseudocode. Okay 3 levels.  O2 levels like this  Okay, and so we have white like 3/4 85627 something like that.  So you'd call even path are right or is not know or is not a leaf or is not the children are not both leaves.  And basically each one of these is a leaf, right?  So so those are all going to go into the base case and return their own and then you just take  3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 8 + 7/18  Okay, let's go through the runtime analysis real fast. So each one of these subproblems of this is T of N - 3 / 4  So you have four problem each of size around and over for so you can you can use the master theorem. Basically, it's like this tea event is less than or equal to T of n / 4 or sorry.  4 * T of n / 4 + and everything else that's not so big and you get to you then is Big O of him any questions about that?  figure  Algorithm would be just an efficient.  Okay.  next question the greedy algorithm  you have a bunch of marks and you can think about these marks as like these rugs that are a yard long and you want to be able to  cover as much as many points as many marks with the fewest number of I just want to cover all the marks with the fewest number of rocks Okay, so  The first greedy strategy is until there's no more.  I'm headed Mark's you find the group of marks that you can cover with one rug that you can cover the most marks you find the position where you can cover the most put the rug down there and then repeat.  So let's look at a counterexample.  For why this doesn't work.  What do I have here?  Let's just make a number line.  You can think about this is zero.  Say when I go up to.  1  2.5  1.5  Okay, so let's consider that the first Mark is at point five.  Doing a different color.  What color are the marks going to be?  purple  Okay, we have one at .5. We have one at one point one. So right here.  We have one at one point for my here.  We have one at 1:26.  We have one at one point nine.  And one at 2.5.  So in order to cover that you can cover for marks with one rug right if you just put the rug.  from one  rent that covers all the way.  But then what happens if you need to cover the other to mark So you need three rugs?  There's a better solution.  Just go from 5 to 1.5 and from 1.5 to 2.5 and then I covered them all and any questions.  Okay.  next greedy strategy  well  I'll let you guys illustrate the greedy strategy on this exam.  I almost did it but there's so there's like a slight difference, right? The second drug is going to start at the one point.  Okay part 3 prove. This greedy strategy is optimal.  Okay, so  Let's do an exchange argument  so consider  a solution  OS  that  does not  put  the first  rug  X1 I guess we should go over and then let it cover on as many other marks from there.  next uncovered mark  I'm just considering some solution. That doesn't pick the first greedy Choice, which is this and now we're going to do an exchange.  So then  there is a solution.  OS Prime  that does  start  the first rub at X1 and Os prime. The number of Rob's is we're trying to minimize, right?  Okay, so that's the statement.  now it's prove it in order to prove it you make an exchange and then you prove it that exchange solution valid and that you've you haven't  Thanks for the exchange.  is create OS Prime from OS by  exchanging  the first  raag of os Prime Trust routing of OS  with  the rug starting  exchange that works and will show why?  first run down the hallway  I think you're the first robbed.  down  the hallway  right, cuz the ordering of the  Okay, so let's prove that OS Prime is valid and that it's better or not when it's not any worse.  Okay, so it's clear that OS and Os Prime have the same number of rugs Frank.  Okay. Now we have to show that OS Prime is valid. So what would make OS Prime invalid would be covered?  But such a mark would have have to have underneath the first rug of os because I was the only thing we changed.  Is that every mark under the first rug of os is also under the first row.  Let me get myself a little bit of more space.  Okay, so every  mark  under  first  Rob Lowe s  Is under first rub of of prime?  There is like a more formal justification in the solutions. If you guys want to look at it. I'm going to give you more of like a pictorial justification so that we can move on.  Okay. So suppose that the first rug of os Prime of os starts at a and ends at a plus one.  okay, and since it's the first rug placed  Or not the first place, but the first rug down the hall. It's got to cover X1.  But it might cover a bunch of other marks to so let's consider some arbitrary Mark XJ. That's underneath this rug.  Okay.  I take off this rug and I put a rug where it's right up against next one.  Tell him you just read Raw.  Just new rods start here.  And those are so it starts at x 1 and goes till x 1 + 1.  So formally what are kind of like the qualities that we're working with here? Well, we want to show that certainly SJ is got to be greater than X1 by the by The Ordering of the marks, right?  We know that XJ is less than a plus one.  because it's underneath that first rug and we also know that one because  so add one to both sides here and we get a plus one is less than x 1 + 1.  And we put it all together.  I guess maybe I should put  Hey is strictly less than x so then we have XJ is less than or equal to a plus one, which is strictly less than exit one plus one. So that shows you that XJ is underneath that rub any questions.  No, you need the qualities.  I'm sorry.  No, I expect you to put some justification take a look at the solution right up.  Just didn't know if I wanted to write all of the things I mean.  I mean, this is pretty clear. I guess I would accept it.  Credit for this portion, but you would need the other portion Frank you need this other you need all of this stuff and then I would expect some sort of.  Just a little sentence here.  because  change  1 rub for another  and then yeah, if you say this and you draw that and you write that I'm fine with that. I'd be happy to be perfectly happy with that.  Any of the questions?  This is just half of the proof.  Directions to the kids in induction. You guys want to see that part?  Yeah.  Okay induction. We're going to clean.  greedy solution  works  on NE  Set n marks  4 and greater than equal to zero.  Okay bass case.  And is equal to 0 then putting.  no rugs  is optimal  inductive hypothesis  suppose  That for some K greater than or equal to.  What's a foursome?  Strictly greater than zero. Let's do it. That's why.  greedy strategy works  or let's say Works instead of a day is optimal. I think I like that better is optimal.  or all for any  set of K marks.  for any k  such that 0 less than or equal to K less than in right?  suppose  I is a set of end marks.  And Os is some solution.  I  Then we have OS has got to be less than or equal to OS Prime by The Exchange argument.  This is  equal to  the greedy placement Union some solution of I prime or I prime is the set of marks that weren't covered by the first rug.  this is less than or equal to buy the inductive hypothesis of  G Union GS of I Prime and this is the definition of the greedy strategy on high.  I did this wrong.  Okay questions.  That's fine.  less than or equal to  Any other questions?  This is any solution.  Exchange to get the first greedy choice.  This is just whatever. This is like whatever that sets the solution was to start with was this thing?  Because it's like captures all cases if I didn't have the first choice.  You could be more careful with your Exchange.  iprime is  where I prime is the set of marks.  uncovered  by the greedy  Rob  the first greedy rug  Okay. So here's the algorithm. You guys can take a look at that but I think we should move on to the dynamic programming problems.  Okay, sweetheart if you want to take over.  Hello.  Okay, so I will be going over.  So if I'm going faster and feel free to let me know as I go.  Malaysian of the previous problem with different constraints.  you have as many  so before before I actually go into the dynamic programming approach.  For this with Nadia.  So what do you say when you start off? What about the first.  Why does that say?  Are you seeing a counterexample for it in the beauty approaches self examples of bulk point one, please.  You will end up with the first and all of them. So anyone have an idea of how we can go about in this.  Right. So why exactly do you require.  exactly  play so that's the most that way between whether it's set up to two variables are such. You have the number of March 1st is  Lyft  Mary too big  go to the first time that I'm doing this.  B-Max  number of marks  that you can color  considering only from undertale  tomorrow  mmm, Flex  X12 accent light  so I died.  Using engrams, how how would you identify kissing bugs?  Okay.  What does each each element of the array present?  maximum number of  sports  covered with with Ciara run like a of each element can be covered including that.  Play car rug.  So, how how would you compute that?  Here's the problem if your speaking students are in your freaking face.  How do I know where to place it?  I actually have two places at every possible set of points.  I don't think so. That's the reason why his question was and you have each element represent the number of an atom.  put on one  this element would represent. What is the maximum number of marks that can be covered with?  The maximum number of a reason why you can't do this this way or it's more complicated to do it. This way is because you compute for each element. You would have to look for a lot of possibilities for one actually have sex if you have one you need to do all possible combinations.  Does this make sense?  any questions  Okay, so  What what is your biscuit?  What are your biscuits?  Exactly. So if you have no more rugs to cover in his  you have  basically  hookah bar  8  So the best kiss.  would be  rug  Speedo Speedo, which means that you have no more mulch to cover.  and  of G  Second Chance indicates that  No more.  Bo sing if the number of marks is left in the number of frogs Place one dragon is Mark, okay.  So what is the number of drugs that I have is significantly smaller?  What's the number of March?  Okay. Now, how how do I how do I?  Create a dental recurrence relation for this.  So if I if I have to take this, so I'm I provided how do I fill up the Matrix?  Exactly. So you basically look at  your first kiss is where you the plug actually covers the Jets mark.  And the second piece is where it doesn't cover.  uTorrent  smart  So, how do I write to the calculations?  She is.  whatever it is 4 - 1  so now is  when I  what are you doing this case?  anyone else  considering you are including the smart in how many marks you can actually cover for this and  you  huel Perkins / 4  Kmart  Any questions on this?  So now that you have your recurrence relation, what what is the fourth step in this?  in the process of writing  You look at the artery in in in this case you have.  Can I light?

What can you do?  Any questions on this?  Okay, so  What what is the final step in this process?  bottom, right  Matrix represents  the coma  So what's the use of?  I should have said drug.  So you would output the bottom right element because  previous  steps right from the beginning  so  or is it is it enough?  Okay, I will assume that it doesn't if you would like me to go over there. Please. Let me know.  So, how how would you find the efficiency?  Exactly filling up this entire Matrix.  Ascension competition the number of elements how long it takes to fill it with each element in The Matrix.  Hello, how are you computer? That is  enzymes are number of elements in The Matrix and each element at the worst-case takes into computer because if  at the most overall and Mart  that makes sense. So  if if  so the 2nd.  Okay, so if you're if you're doing are -1.  He said instead of our of AR.  A Plus Auto  covering any mark  You want to account for the fact that you actually covered Kmart?  so which is my  how many months do you have covered for the gym?  What is V 51 rug?
